"In order to study the effect of TiC on the microstructure and properties of cladding coatings, TiC/TiAl composite coatings have been prepared by using a laser cladding technique on TiAl alloy, and the microstructure and properties of the resulting composite coatings have been investigated using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), micro-hardness testing, X-ray stress measurements, friction and wear testing, and an electrochemical workstation. The results showed that when the particle size of TiC is up to micron, the growth of TiC is more developed, the dendrite growth direction is disordered, and the cladding quality is poor. When the particle size of TiC is nanoscale, the morphology of the reinforcement phase TiC is mainly granular and thin rods, which is uniform in the coating and the direction of growth is regular. When the concentration of TiC reaches 20%, the microstructure of the cladding layer grows well and is dense. The microhardness and wear resistance of the coatings prepared by adding nano TiC are better than those of the coatings prepared by micron TiC. When the content of nano TiC in the coatings increases from 10% to 20%, the microhardness and wear resistance of the coatings are obviously improved. The residual stress of the coating is positively related to the crack rate. The residual stress in the coating is tensile stress, and the crack type is the crystal crack in the hot crack. When the particle size of TiC is small and the concentration is high, the coating shows better corrosion resistance."
"Climate change will affect the composition of plant and animal communities in many habitats and geographic settings. This presents a dilemma for conservation programs - will the portfolio of protected lands we now have achieve a goal of conserving biodiversity in the future when the ecological communities occurring within them change? Climate change will significantly alter many plant communities, but the geophysical underpinnings of these landscapes, such as landform, elevation, soil, and geological properties, will largely remain the same. Studies show that extant landscapes with a diversity of geophysical characteristics support diverse plant and animal communities. Therefore, geophysically diverse landscapes will likely support diverse species assemblages in the future, although which species and communities will be present is not altogether clear. Following protocols advanced in studies spanning large regions, we developed a down-scaled, high spatial resolution measure of geophysical complexity based on Ecological Land Units (ELUs) and examined the relationship between plant species richness, ecological community richness, and ELU richness (number of different ELU types). We found that extant landscapes with high ELU richness had a greater variety of ecological community types and high species richness of trees, shrubs, and herbaceous plants. We developed a spatial representation of diverse ELU landscapes to inform local conservation practitioners, such as land trusts, of potential conservation targets that will likely support diverse faunas and floras despite the impact of climate change."
"Reading research uses different tasks to investigate different levels of the reading process, such as word recognition, syntactic parsing, or semantic integration. It seems to be tacitly assumed that the underlying cognitive process that constitute reading are stable across those tasks. However, nothing is known about what happens when readers switch from one reading task to another. The stability assumptions of the reading process suggest that the cognitive system resolves this switching between two tasks quickly. Here, we present an alternative language-game hypothesis (LGH) of reading that begins by treating reading as a softly-assembled process and that assumes, instead of stability, context-sensitive flexibility of the reading process. LGH predicts that switching between two reading tasks leads to longer lasting phase-transition like patterns in the reading process. Using the nonlinear-dynamical tool of recurrence quantification analysis, we test these predictions by examining series of individual word reading times in self-paced reading tasks where native (L1) and second language readers (L2) transition between random word and ordered text reading tasks. We find consistent evidence for phase-transitions in the reading times when readers switch from ordered text to random-word reading, but we find mixed evidence when readers transition from random-word to ordered-text reading. In the latter case, L2 readers show moderately stronger signs for phase-transitions compared to L1 readers, suggesting that familiarity with a language influences whether and how such transitions occur. The results provide evidence for LGH and suggest that the cognitive processes underlying reading are not fully stable across tasks but exhibit soft-assembly in the interaction between task and reader characteristics."
"Mirim Lagoon (ML) is a large choked lagoon connected to the Patos Lagoon estuary and eventually to Mangueira Lake. Together, these water bodies form the most extensive lagoon system in South America. ML is a transboundary basin shared by Brazil and Uruguay that serves as a water reservoir, providing freshwater for public supply and agricultural activities. This work evaluated the transport patterns and residence time of ML using numerical simulations forced by time series of the tributaries' discharge and by reanalysis of atmospheric data. The results indicate a mean residence time of 180 days, and spatial and temporal variations of up to 100 days were presented. The discharge conditions and the wind regime are the causes of such high variability on the distribution of the residence time at Mirim Lagoon. This high variability indicates that specific periods are more susceptible to be impacted by exogenous contaminants."
"Introduction. - Recent studies with SD OCT had shown early axonal damage to the macular ganglion cell complex (which consists of the three innermost layers of the retina: Inner Plexiform Layer [IPL], Ganglion Cell Layer [GCL], Retinal Nerve Fibre layer [RNFL]) in optic nerve pathology. Retrobulbar optic neuritis (RBON), occurring frequently in demyelinating diseases, leads to atrophy of the optic nerve fibers at the level of the ganglion cell axons, previously described in the literature. The goal of this study is to evaluate the progression of optic nerve fiber defects and macular ganglion cell complex defects with the SPECTRALIS OCT via a reproducible method by calculating a mean thickness in each quadrant after an episode of retrobulbar optic neuritis. Methods. - This is a prospective monocentric observational study including 8 patients at the Clermont-Ferrand university medical center. All patients underwent ocular examination with macular and disc OCT analysis and a Goldmann visual field at the time of inclusion (onset or recurrence of RBON), at 3 months and at 6 months. Results. - Patients were 40-years-old on average at the time of inclusion. After 6 months of follow-up, there was progression of the atrophy of the macular ganglion cell complex in the affected eye on (11.5% or 11 mu m) predominantly inferonasally (13.9% or 16 mu m) and superonasally (12.9% or 14 mu m) while the other eye remained stable. The decrease in thickness occurred mainly in the most internal 3 layers of the retina. On average, the loss in thickness of the peripapillary RNFL was predominantly inferotemporal (24.9% or 39 mu m) and superotemporal (21.8% or 28 mu m). Discussion. - In 3 months of progression, the loss of optic nerve fibers is already seen on macular and disc OCT after an episode of RBON, especially in inferior quadrants in spite of the improvement in the Goldmann visual field and visual acuity. Segmentation by quadrant was used here to compare the progression of the defect by region compared to the fovea in a global and reproducible way. The loss of thickness, predominantly inferonasally and superonasally, appears to correspond to the temporal loss on optic nerve OCT according to the literature. Conclusion. - The follow-up of these patients with retrobulbar neuritis is important as shown by the possibility of relapse, especially in multiple sclerosis. Monitoring of the macular ganglion cell complex by a global method of calculation could contribute to the detection and localization of early damage after an episode of retrobulbar neuritis. This could possibly lead to a discussion of treatment modification or increased surveillance in cases of early detection of nerve fiber atrophy, or to showing the importance of monitoring, since monitoring of RBON is not standardized.

"Small molecules that modulate biological functions are targets of modern day drug discovery efforts. In a common platform fragment-based drug discovery, two fragments that bind to adjacent sites on a target are identified and are then linked together using different linkers to identify the linkage for optimum activity. What are not known from these studies are the effects these linkers, which typically contain C, H, and 0 atoms, have on the properties of the individual fragment. Herein, we investigate such effects in a bisbenzimidazole fragment whose derivatives have a wide range of therapeutic applications in nucleic acid recognition, sensing, and photodynamic therapy and as cellular probes. We report a dramatic effect of linker length and composition of alkynyl (clickable) Hoechst 33258 derivatives in target binding and cell uptake. We show that the binding of Hoechst 33258-modeled bisbenzimidazoles (1-9) that contain linkers of varying lengths (3-21 atoms) display length- and composition-dependent variation in B-DNA stabilization using a variety of spectroscopic methods. For a dodecamer DNA duplex, the thermal stabilization varied from 0.3 to 9.0 degrees C as the linker length increased from 3 to 21 atoms, respectively. Compounds with linker lengths of <= 11 atoms (such as compounds 1 and 5) are localized in the nucleus, while compounds with long linkers (such as compounds 8 and 9) are distributed in the extranuclear space, as well, with possible interactions with extranuclear targets. These findings provide insights into future drug design by revealing how linkers can influence the biophysical and cellular properties of individual drug fragments."
"This study investigates five lightweight corundum-magnesium aluminate spinel castables (LCSC) which consisted of porous corundum-spinel aggregates and matrices with 0-2.8 wt% silicon carbide (SiC). The effect of the SiC powder content (SPC) in the matrix on the microstructure, strength, thermal conductivity and slag resistance was analyzed by XRD, SEM and EDS as well as by the thermochemical software FactSage. The addition of SiC powder resulted in a significantly improved interface bonding between the porous aggregates and the matrix enhancing the strength and slag resistance. Whereas the thermal conductivity at 300 degrees C and 500 degrees C remained unchanged, it increased significantly at 800 degrees C and 1000 degrees C. The optimized LCSC contained 1.9 wt% SiC powder which combined a suitable apparent porosity (32.5%), a low bulk density (2.41 g/cm(3)), a high flexural strength (17.62 MPa), a high compressive strength (100.76 MPa), a low thermal conductivity (0.978 W/m.K, 1000 degrees C) and a high slag resistance.

"Purpose of review Esophageal manometry has shown its usefulness to estimate transpulmonary pressure, that is lung stress, and the intensity of spontaneous effort in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome. However, clinical uptake of esophageal manometry in ICU is still low. Thus, the purpose of review is to describe technical tips to adequately measure esophageal pressure at the bedside, and then update the most important clinical applications of esophageal manometry in ICU. Recent findings Each esophageal balloon has its own nonstressed volume and it should be calibrated properly to measure pleural pressure accurately: transpulmonary pressure calculated on absolute esophageal pressure reflects values in the lung regions adjacent to the esophageal balloon (i.e. dependent to middle lung). Inspiratory transpulmonary pressure calculated from airway plateau pressure and the chest wall to respiratory system elastance ratio reasonably reflects lung stress in the nondependent 'baby' lung, at highest risk of hyperinflation. Also esophageal pressure can be used to detect and minimize patient self-inflicted lung injury. Summary Esophageal manometry is not a complicated technique. There is a large potential to improve clinical outcome in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome, acting as an early detector of risk of lung injury from mechanical ventilation and vigorous spontaneous effort."
"Anomaly detection from crowd is a widely addressed problem in the field of computer vision. It is an essential part of video surveillance and security. In surveillance videos, very little information about anomalous behaviors is available, so it becomes difficult to identify such activities. In this work, transfer learning technique is used to train the network. A convolutional neural network (CNN) based VGG16 pre-trained model is used to learn spatial level appearance features for anomalous and normal patterns. Two approaches are explored to detect anomalies, i) homogeneous approach and ii) hybrid approach. In homogeneous approach, pre-trained network is used to fine-tune CNN for each dataset, while testing, single dataset is considered. Whereas, in hybrid approach, pre-trained network is used to fine-tune CNN on one dataset and it is further used to fine-tune another dataset. The performance of proposed system is verified on standard benchmark datasets such as UCSD and UMN available for anomaly detection, also the results of proposed system are compared with existing deep learning approaches."
"A total of 335 lactating sows (Landrace x Large White) were used in two experiments to determine the optimum ratio of standardized ileal digestible lysine (SID-Lys) to metabolizable energy (ME) for mixed parity sows during lactation. In Exp. 1, 185 sows (weighing an average of 256.2 +/- 6.5 kg and having an average parity of 3.4 +/- 0.3) were allocated to one of six experimental diets in a completely randomized block design within parity groups (1, 2, and 3+). The experimental diets were formulated to contain 3.06, 3.16, 3.20, 3.25, 3.30 or 3.40 Mcal/kg of ME and each diet was fed to the sows throughout a 28 day lactation. All diets provided a similar SID-lysine level (0.86%). As a result, the diets provided a SID-Lys: ME ratio of 2.81, 2.72, 2.69, 2.65, 2.61 or 2.53 g/Mcal ME. Sow feed intake was significantly (P < 0.01) affected by the energy content of the diet as well as by sow parity. Using regression analysis, feed intake was shown to be maximized at 3.25, 3.21, 3.21 and 3.21 Mcal/kg of ME for parity 1, 2, 3+ sows and the entire cohort of sows respectively (quadratic; P < 0.01). In addition, the result of feed intake can be expressed as 2.65, 2.69, 2.69 and 2.68 g/Mcal based on analysis of SID-Lys: ME ratio. Litter weight gain was affected by dietary treatment for parity 3+ sows and the entire cohort (P < 0.01). Based on regression analysis, litter weight gain was maximized at 3.25 and 3.24 Mcal/kg of ME for parity 3+ (quadratic; P < 0.01) and the entire cohort (quadratic; P < 0.01). Similarly, the result of litter weight gain could be expressed as 2.65 and 2.66 g/Mcal of SIDLys: ME ratio. Therefore, 3.25 Mcal/kg of ME was selected for Exp. 2 in which 150 sows (weighing 254.6 +/- 7.3 kg and having an average parity of 3.4 +/- 0.4) were allocated to one of five treatments in a completely randomized block design within parity (1, 2, and 3+). The experimental diets were formulated to contain 2.1, 2.4, 2.7, 3.0 or 3.3 g/Mcal of SID-Lys: ME ratio with all diets providing 3.25 Mcal/kg of ME. The diets were fed to the sows throughout a 28 day lactation. Sow body weight loss was affected by dietary treatment (parity 3+ sows, P = 0.02; entire cohort, P < 0.01) and by sow parity (P < 0.01). Litter weight at weaning and litter weight gain were affected by dietary treatment for parity 1, 2, 3+ sows and the entire cohort (P < 0.01) as well as by sow parity (P < 0.01). Plasma urea nitrogen (P < 0.01), creatinine (P < 0.01) and non-esterifide fatty acids (P = 0.04) were decreased as the SID-Lys: ME ratio of the diet increased. Insulin-like growth factor-1 (P = 0.02), estradiol (P < 0.01) and luteinizing hormone (P = 0.02) were increased as the SID-Lys: ME ratio in diet increased. Based on a broken-line model, the estimated SID-Lys: ME ratio to maximize litter weight gain was estimated to be 3.05 g/Mcal."
"Background: Advanced malignant solitary fibrous tumors (SFTs) are rare soft-tissue sarcomas with a poor prognosis. Several treatment options have been reported, but with uncertain rates of efficacy. Our aim is to describe the activity of trabectedin in a retrospective, multi-center French series of patients with SFTs. Methods: Patients were mainly identified through the French RetrospectYon database and were treated between January 2008 and May 2013. Trabectedin was administered at an initial dose of 1.5 mg/m(2), q3 weeks. The best tumor response was assessed according to the Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors 1.1. The Kaplan-Meier method was used to estimate median progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). The growth-modulation index (GMI) was defined as the ratio between the time to progression with trabectedin (TTPn) and the TTP with the immediately prior line of treatment (TTPn-1). Results: Eleven patients treated with trabectedin for advanced SFT were identified. Trabectedin had been used as second-line treatment in 8 patients (72.7 %) and as at least third-line therapy in a further 3 (27.3 %). The best RECIST response was a partial response (PR) in one patient (9.1 %) and stable disease (SD) in eight patients (72.7 %). Disease-control rate (DCR = PR + SD) was 81.8 %. After a median follow-up of 29.2 months, the median PFS was 11.6 months (95 % CI = 2.0; 15.2 months) and the median OS was 22.3 months (95 % CI = 9.1 months; not reached). The median GMI was 1.49 (range: 0.11-4.12). Conclusion: Trabectedin is a very promising treatment for advanced SFTs. Further investigations are needed."
"This paper presents and discusses the experimental results of uniaxial tensile tests of fiber reinforced polymer externally strengthened reinforced concrete (FRP strengthened RC) prisms in terms of crack width and crack spacing. As a non-contact and material independent system for in-time measurement of displacement and strain, the digital image correlation (DIC) technique has been used in this study for investigating the evolution of strains and formation of cracks during uniaxial tensile tests. As a result, the cracks were measured precisely at any load stage. The experimental results of tests performed by authors and other researchers on FRP strengthened RC members in tension are compared to prediction models from code provisions and guidelines (Eurocode 2 and fib 14), and their suitability are analyzed and discussed. The results show the dependence of the behavior and crack characteristics of FRP strengthened RC members to parameters such as wrapping scheme and FRP reinforcement ratios which are not included in design provisions for crack analysis. A new formulation for predicting crack width and spacing in FRP strengthened RC members, calibrated using the experimental results, has been proposed which considers all the main affecting parameters.

"Two procedures to improve the performance of the Hach EZ test kit for quantifying inorganic arsenic concentrations in drinking water have been investigated. In the first, a digital image of the colored spot formed on the test strip, obtained with a flat-bed scanner was analyzed, by the computer program Colors, for the R, G, and B values. Calibrations were constructed by plotting the B values as a function of concentration. Agreement between the experimentally determined B-values and those of the printed chart was only obtained by either increasing the reaction time (to 40 min) or increasing the reaction temperature. The precision as a function of concentration was quantified. A comparison with previously estimated values for visual comparison of the colours, showed that the improved precision of the digital analysis would produce fewer false positive and fewer false negative results at the important threshold values of 10 and 50 mu g L-1. By running the test for 24 h, improved performance at the low concentration (around 10 mu g L-1) end of the response scale was obtained."
"In calcareous soils, two methods for measuring soil organic carbon (SOC) have been traditionally used: 1) wet oxidation, and 2) dry combustion in which SOC is measured either directly by removing soil inorganic carbon (SIC) from samples through an acid pretreatment, or indirectly by subtracting SIC measured by a calcimeter from total soil C. These methods have well documented experimental limitations that may result in erroneous quantification of C stocks and cycling in calcareous Mediterranean soils. An alternative approach is ramped combustion, which takes advantage of the large difference in the temperatures at which SOC and SIC combust or decompose. Our aim in this study was to test the capability of a continuous, ramped combustion technique combining differential scanning calorimetry and evolved gas analysis to quantify SIC and SOC in calcareous soil samples, and compare this technique with conventional techniques. We also sought to use thermal analysis to test the efficacy of acid fumigation for carbonate removal, and to evaluate the effects of acid fumigation on SOC quality. SIC and SOC concentrations from a set of 23 soil samples differing in carbonate concentrations were well correlated among conventional and ramped combustion methods, indicating that ramped combustion is an effective method to simultaneously quantify SIC and SOC in calcareous soil samples. Ramped combustion was also effective in demonstrating incomplete carbonate removal in several samples, though quantification was made difficult by sample mass issues due to hydrophilicity after fumigation. Ramped combustion also revealed substantial qualitative changes in the thermal lability of residual organic matter, as evidenced by changes in CO2 EGA thermogram shape and peak temperatures. As a result, ramped combustion appears to be a preferable single-sample method for the simultaneous quantification of SOC and SIC in calcareous soil, providing a relatively rapid, cost- and labor-effective method that precludes the use of hazardous reactants such as those used in wet oxidation and acid fumigation."
"Designing integrated circuits with CMOS technology in millimeter-wave (mm-wave) range is highly challenging. This letter presents a 205 GHz amplifier drawing 43.4 mA from a 0.9 V power supply with 10.5 dB power gain, saturated power of -1.6 dBm, and P-1dB approximate to -5.8 dBm in a standard 90 nm CMOS process. Moreover, the design employs internal (layout-based)/external (using passive embedding around the transistor) neutralization techniques for improving performance and yield of the overall system while achieving optimum operation state and reducing the effect of dominant internal parasitic capacitors. The fabricated amplifier has the highest operation frequency among all reported amplifiers in 90 nm and greater CMOS technologies."
"For the three-dimensional terminal guidance problem of multiple missiles cooperatively intercepting a maneuvering target, a novel finite-time cooperative guidance law with impact angle constraints is proposed. It is continuous and requires no information on target maneuvers. Firstly, the multiple missiles cooperative guidance model with impact angle constraints is constructed. We subsequently divide the process of cooperative guidance law design into two stages. In the first stage, based on the adaptive super-twisting algorithm and integral sliding mode, a new finite-time consensus protocol, i.e., the acceleration command on the line-of-sight direction, is designed to guarantee that all missiles reach the maneuvering target simultaneously. In the second stage, a new adaptive nonsingular fast terminal sliding mode control law, i.e., the acceleration command on the normal direction of the line-of-sight, is developed to ensure the finite-time convergence of the line-of-sight angular rate and line-of-sight angle between individual missile and the target. Furthermore, the detailed finite-time stability analysis is given based on the Lyapunov theory. Finally, numerical simulations demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed cooperative guidance law.

"The incidence of breast cancer is increasing worldwide, and this seems to be related to an increase in lifestyle risk factors, including physical inactivity and overweight/obesity. We have reported previously that exercise induced a circulating angiostatic phenotype characterized by increased soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase-1 (sFlt-1) and endostatin and decreased unbound vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in men. However, there are no data on women. The present study determines the following: (a) whether moderate exercise increased sFlt-1 and endostatin and decreased unbound VEGF in the circulation of adult female volunteers and (b) whether overweight/obese women have a higher plasma level of unbound VEGF than lean women. A total of 72 African American and White adult women volunteers ranging in age from 18 to 44 years were enrolled in the exercise study. All the participants walked on a treadmill for 30 min at a moderate intensity (55-59% heart rate reserve), and oxygen consumption (VO2) was quantified utilizing a metabolic cart. We obtained blood samples before and immediately after exercise from 63 participants. ELISA assays showed that the plasma levels of sFlt-1 were 67.8 +/- 3.7 pg/ml immediately after exercise (30 min), significantly higher than the basal levels, 54.5 +/- 3.3 pg/ml, before exercise (P < 0.01; n = 63). There was no significant difference in the % increase in the sFlt-1 levels after exercise between African American and White (P = 0.533) women or between lean and overweight/obese women (P = 0.892). There was no significant difference in the plasma levels of unbound VEGF (35.28 +/- 5.47 vs. 35.23 +/- 4.96 pg/ml; P=0.99) or endostatin (111.12 +/- 5.48 vs. 115.45 +/- 7.15 ng/ml; P=0.63) before and after exercise. The basal plasma levels of unbound VEGF in overweight/obese women were 52.26 +/- 9.6 pg/ml, significantly higher than the basal levels of unbound VEGF in lean women, 27.34 +/- 4.99 pg/ml (P<0.05). The results support our hypothesis that exercise-induced plasma levels of sFlt-1 could be an important clinical biomarker to explore the mechanisms of exercise training in reducing the progression of breast cancer and that VEGF is an important biomarker in obesity and obesity-related cancer progression.

"This paper analyzes the performance of indoor orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) optical wireless communication systems in the presence of light emitting diode (LED) nonlinear distortions. There are several forms of optical OFDM using intensity modulation [7th Int. Symp. on Communication Systems Networks and Digital Signal Processing (CSNDSP), 2010, pp. 566-570]. In this paper, DC-biased optical OFDM (DCO-OFDM) and asymmetrically clipped optical OFDM (ACO-OFDM) are considered. ACO-OFDM produces a half-wave symmetry time signal at the output of the OFDM modulator by special assignment of subcarriers, thus allowing signal clipping at the zero level and avoiding the need for DC bias at the expense of data rate reduction. DCO-OFDM assigns data to all possible subcarriers to increase the data rate. However, half-wave symmetry signals cannot be achieved and a high DC bias is needed to convert the bipolar signal to a unipolar signal before modulating the LED intensity. This paper considers a practical LED model and studies the performance of both systems in terms of average electrical OFDM signal power versus bit error ratio in the presence of an additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channel. In addition, DC power consumption and the transmitted optical power for the two systems are compared. The analytical results are validated through Monte Carlo simulations and the obtained results demonstrate close match. It is shown that LED clipping has significant impact on the performance of both systems and an optimum system design should take into account the OFDM signal power, DC-bias point, and LED dynamic range."
"This paper suggests a new approach for change detection (CD) in 3D point clouds. It combines classification and CD in one step using machine learning. The point cloud data of both epochs are merged for computing features of four types: features describing the point distribution, a feature relating to relative terrain elevation, features specific for the multi-target capability of laser scanning, and features combining the point clouds of both epochs to identify the change. All these features are merged in the points and then training samples are acquired to create the model for supervised classification, which is then applied to the whole study area. The final results reach an overall accuracy of over 90% for both epochs of eight classes: lost tree, new tree, lost building, new building, changed ground, unchanged building, unchanged tree, and unchanged ground."
"This paper proposes to analyse second occurrence foci as foci whose domain is properly contained in the background of another focus domain, and linearly follows the last focus of that domain. It is shown that general assumptions about the representation and prosodic realisation of focus predict that foci with these properties will be realised by stress, but not pitch accent, i.e. as second occurrence foci. Furthermore, whether a focus domain is subordinated in this sense follows from general principles of focus assignment and interpretation. No assumptions specific to second occurrence foci are required to explain the phenomenon. The analysis relies on, and thus indirectly supports, the assumptions that focus/background, rather than new/given are the relevant concepts in stress and accent assignment, and that focus realisation is mediated by prosodic, particularly metrical, structure."
"The human gut contains a vast array of viruses, mostly bacteriophages. The majority remain uncharacterized, and their roles in shaping the gut microbiome and in impacting on human health remain poorly understood. We performed longitudinal metagenomic analysis of fecal viruses in healthy adults that reveal high temporal stability, individual specificity, and correlation with the bacterial microbiome. Using a database-independent approach that uses most of the sequencing data, we uncovered the existence of a stable, numerically predominant individual-specific persistent personal virome. Clustering of viral genomes and de novo taxonomic annotation identified several groups of crAss-like and Microviridae bacteriophages as the most stable colonizers of the human gut. CRISPR-based host prediction highlighted connections between these stable viral communities and highly predominant gut bacterial taxa such as Bacteroides, Prevotella, and Faecalibacterium. This study provides insights into the structure of the human gut virome and serves as an important baseline for hypothesis-driven research."
"PURPOSE: To identify frequency and pattern of contact sensitization among patients with periorbital dermatitis. DESIGN: Cross-sectional retrospective investigation of 1247 patients referred for patch testing over a 17-year period. METHODS: Data were collected for patients undergoing patch testing to the standard and customized trays between January 1990 and December 2006 at the Massachusetts General Hospital, Contact Dermatitis Clinic. Our study group consisted of 266 patients affected by periorbital dermatitis. Findings were compared to 981 referrals without periorbital dermatitis (controls). Patch test results were read after 48 and 72 hours and classified as allergic, questionable, irritant, or negative. Statistical analyses were carried out by using chi(2) test and Fisher exact test. RESULTS: General epidemiologic data among periorbital dermatitis patients showed significant predominance of female gender (87.6%) and of individuals aged 40 to 59 years (45.9%). Nickel (16.5%) and fragrance mix (13.2%) were the top-ranking sensitizers. Ingredients of topical ophthalmologic products did not result in significant sensitization. Comparison of the periorbital dermatitis group to the controls did not reveal significant differences in sensitization pattern. Patch testing confirmed the likelihood of allergic contact dermatitis in 50.8% of the periorbital dermatitis patients tested. CONCLUSIONS: Allergic contact dermatitis is a common cause of periorbital dermatitis. Patch testing should be considered in all patients with periorbital dermatitis when suspecting contact allergy in order to identify and avoid offending allergens. (Am J Ophthalmol 2010;150: 366-370.

"Background and Purpose-Conflicting data exist regarding outcomes after intra-arterial therapy (IAT) in elderly stroke patients. We compare safety and clinical outcomes of multimodal IAT in elderly versus nonelderly patients and investigate differences in baseline health and disability as possible explanatory factors. Methods-Data from a prospectively collected institutional IAT database were analyzed comparing elderly (80 years or older) versus nonelderly patients. Baseline demographics, angiographic reperfusion (Thrombolysis in Cerebral Infarction scale score 2-3), rate of parenchymal hematoma type 2, and 90-day modified Rankin Scale scores were compared in univariate and multivariate analyses. Results-There were 49 elderly and 130 nonelderly patients treated between 2005 and 2010. Between the 2 cohorts, there was no significant difference in Thrombolysis in Cerebral Infarction 2 to 3 reperfusion (71% vs 75%; P=0.57), time to reperfusion (P=0.77), or rate of parenchymal hematoma type 2 (4% vs 7%; P=0.73) after IAT. However, elderly patients had significantly lower rates of good outcome (modified Rankin Scale score 0-2: 2% vs 33%; P<0.0001) and higher mortality (59% vs 24%; P<0.0001) at 90 days. Atrial fibrillation, coronary artery disease, hypertension, hyperlipidema, and baseline disability were significantly more common in elderly patients. Adjusting for baseline disability, stroke severity, and reperfusion, elderly patients were 29-times more likely to be dependent or dead at 90 days (odds ratio, 28.7; 95% confidence interval, 3.2-255.7; P=0.003). Conclusions-Despite comparable rates of reperfusion and significant hemorrhage, elderly patients had worse clinical outcomes after IAT, which may relate, in part, to worse baseline health and disability. The use of IAT in the elderly should be performed after a careful analysis of the potential risks and benefits. (Stroke. 2012;43:2356-2361.)"
"We aim to investigate the effect of mitochondrial cytochrome c release and its redox state on the mitochondrial-dependent apoptotic pathway and yak meat tenderization during postmortem aging. Results indicated that the internal environment factors considerably decreased, whereas mitochondrial dysfunction increased in the early stage (0-72 h). Moreover, the release of mitochondrial cytochrome c into the cytosol, which was an apoptotic early event and the apoptosome elements in the cytoplasm changed remarkably with the increase of aging time. Meanwhile, N,N,N',N'-tetramethylphenylene-1, 4-diamine (TMPD) inhibited the mitochondrial apoptotic process and postmortem meat tenderization by influencing the redox state of cytochrome c and apoptotic factors. These findings confirmed that the internal environment factors in the muscles provided essential conditions for mitochondrial cytochrome c, which activated the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway by forming apoptosome complexes. The reduction state of cytochrome c produced by TMPD plays a negative role in the activation of the mitochondrial apoptotic cascade reaction and meat tenderization during postmortem aging. We conclude that mitochondrial cytochrome c release and oxidized cytochrome c plays a significant role in yak meat tenderization by regulating the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway."
"Offshore tropical river plumes are associated with areas of high N-2 fixation (diazotrophy) and biological carbon drawdown. Episodic blooms of the diatom Hemiaulus hauckii and its diazotrophic cyanobacterial symbiont Richelia intracellularis are believed to dominate that carbon drawdown, but the mechanism is not well understood. We report primary productivity associated with blooms of these diatom-diazotroph assemblages (DDAs) in the offshore plume of the Amazon River using simultaneous measurements of O-2/Ar ratios and the triple-isotope composition of dissolved O-2. In these blooms, we observe peaks in net community productivity, but relatively small changes in gross primary productivity, suggesting that DDA blooms increase the ecosystem carbon export ratio more than twofold. These events of enhanced export efficiency lead to biological uptake of dissolved inorganic carbon and silicate, whose longer mixed-layer residence times otherwise obscure the differential impact of DDAs. The shorter-term rate estimates presented here are consistent with the results derived from longer-term geochemical tracers, confirming that DDAs drive a significant biological CO2 pump in tropical oceans.

"This paper proposes an equivalent circuit model of a multilayer ceramic capacitor (MLCC), in which the impedance characteristics of an MLCC could be predicted at design stage before fabrication and measurement. An MLCC can be divided into three regions: end, overlap, and nonoverlap regions depending on the spatial structure of the plates, and the parameters, such as R, L, G, and C are calculated in each region analytically using partial inductance of rectangular plates or/and multiconductor transmission line theory. The measured and EM-simulated impedance of an MLCC coincides to the calculated impedance from the proposed model quite nice over almost the whole frequency range of interests, which proves the validness of the proposed model. Since calculation time is actually nil using the proposed model, compared to the time using the EM simulation, the model can be very useful when one needs to design an MLCC, especially when one needs a lot of iterations to obtain the final design target of an MLCC."
"This study investigated the ways in which two groups of four adult learners of English as a second language (ESL) responded to unfamiliar words they encountered in four communication tasks and the effect that different levels of engagement with these words (including negotiation of form and meaning) had on subsequent recall of word meaning. Of the four tasks, two were information gap tasks and two were opinion gap tasks. The results showed a strong task type effect on both the amount and type of negotiation, with more negotiation of the form of words (including spelling and pronunciation) in the information gap tasks and, conversely, more negotiation of meaning in the opinion gap tasks. Through the negotiation process, the learners in the study provided accurate information to each other on word meaning. However, only a small proportion of the total number of unfamiliar words in the tasks were actually negotiated for meaning. The prediction that negotiated words would be more likely to be learnt was confirmed, although the learners also showed improved recall of many words that had not been negotiated. Averaged across learners and tasks, the post-test gains approximated to four instances of word learning per 30 minutes of task work, a gain measured three days after the words were met in the tasks. Seen as a proportion of unfamiliar words in the pre-test these are gains of around one in every three unfamiliar words met in the tasks. The finding that much of the improved recall of word meaning was for words that had not been negotiated indicates that the role of negotiation in learning through communication tasks needs to be viewed from a wider perspective."
"Background: Women represent an increasingly growing share of the medical workforce in high-income countries, with abundant research focusing on reasons and implications of the phenomenon. Little evidence is available from low-and middle-income countries, which is odd given the possible repercussion this may have for the local supply of medical services and, ultimately, for attaining universal health coverage. Methods: Drawing from secondary analysis of primary survey data, this paper analyses the proportion and characteristics of female physicians in Bissau, Maputo and Praia, with the objective of gaining insights on the extent and features of the feminization of the medical workforce in low-and middle-income settings. We used descriptive statistics, parametric and non-parametric test to compare groups and explore associations between different variables. Zero-inflated and generalized linear models were employed to analyse the number of hours worked in the private and public sector by male and female physicians. Results and discussion: We show that although female physicians do not represent yet the majority of the medical workforce, feminization of the profession is under way in the three locations analysed, as women are presently over-represented in younger age groups. Female doctors distribute unevenly across medical specialties in the three cities and are absent from traditionally male-dominated ones such as surgery, orthopaedics and stomatology. Our data also show that they engage as much as their male peers in private practice, although overall they dedicate fewer hours to the profession, particularly in the public sector. Conclusions: While more research is needed to understand how this phenomenon affects rural areas in a broader range of locations, our work shows the value of exploring the differences between female and male physicians' engagement with the profession in order to anticipate the impact of such feminization on national health systems and workforces in low-and middle-income countries."
"Conventional ultrasonic transducers cannot withstand high temperatures for two main reasons: the piezoelectric elements within them depolarize, and differential thermal expansion of the different materials within a transducer causes them to fail. In this paper, the design of a high-temperature ultrasonic thickness gauge that bypasses these problems is described. The system uses a waveguide to isolate the vulnerable transducer and piezoelectric elements from the high-temperature measurement zone. Use of thin and long waveguides of rectangular cross section allows large temperature gradients to be sustained over short distances without the need for additional cooling equipment. The main problems that had to be addressed were the transmission and reception of ultrasonic waves into and from the testpiece that the waveguides are coupled to, and optimization of the wave propagation along the waveguide itself. It was found that anti-plane shear loading performs best at transmitting and receiving from the surface of a component that is to be inspected. Therefore, a non-dispersive guided wave mode in large-aspect-ratio rectangular strips was employed to transmit the anti-plane shear loading from the transducer to the measurement zone. Different joining methods to attach the waveguides to the component were investigated and experiments showed that clamping the waveguides to the component surface gave the best results. The thickness of different plate samples was consistently measured to within less than 0.1 mm. Performance at high temperatures was tested in a furnace at 730 degrees C for 4 weeks without signal degradation. Thicknesses in the range of 3 to 25 mm could be monitored using Hanning windowed tonebursts with 2 MHz center frequency."
"Calorimetry, densimetry, H-1 NMR and UV-vis spectroscopy were used to characterize inclusion complex formation of hydroxypropylated alpha- and beta-cyclodextrins with meta- and para-aminobenzoic acids in aqueous solutions at 298.15 K. Formation of more stable inclusion complexes between para-aminobenzoic acid and cyclodextrins was observed. The binding of aminobenzoic acids with hydroxypropyl-alpha-cyclodextrin was found to be enthalpy-governed owing to the prevalence of van der Waals interactions and possible H-binding. Complex formation of hydroxypropyl-beta-cyclodextrin with both acids is mainly entropy driven. The increased entropy contribution observed in this case is determined by dehydration of solutes occurring during the revealed deeper insertion of aminobenzoic acids into the cavity of hydroxypropyl-beta-cyclodextrin. By comparing complex formation of aminobenzoic acids with native and substituted cyclodextrins it was found that the availability of hydroxypropyl groups slightly influenced the thermodynamic parameters and did not change the binding mode or driving forces of interaction."
"Behaviors and performance of 23 typically developing infants were assessed longitudinally at 6, 9, 12, 18, and 24 months in two means-end tasks: pulling a towel or rotating a turntable to obtain a supported object. With age, infants performed more goal-directed behaviors, leading to increased problem-solving success. Intentionality emerged earlier in the towel task than in the turntable task (6.9 vs. 10.8 months). Potential knowledge transfer between the tasks was first observed at 9 months. This study provides insight into the development of means-end learning, the emergence of intentionality, and potential transfer of knowledge in tasks involving a similar concept (support) but requiring different modes of action for success (pulling vs. rotating)."
"A series of novel organically templated germanium antimony sulfides have been solvothermally synthesized and structurally, thermally, and optically characterized. The compound [Me2NH2](6)[(Ge2Sb2S7)(Ge4S10)] (1) features two distinct tetranuclear [Ge2Sb2S7](2-) and [Ge4S10](4-) isolated clusters. The compound [(Me)(2)NH2] [DabcoH](2)[Ge7Sb3S10] (2) (Dabco= triethylenediamine) features a 1D-[Ge2Sb3S10](n)(3n-) ribbon constructed with two [GeSbS5](n)(3n-) chains bridged by Sb3+ ion in psi-SbS4 configuration.

The compound [(Me)(2)NH2](2)[GeSb2S6] (5) previously reported by us features a 3D chiral microporous structure with the chiral channels. The optical absorption spectra indicate that all the compounds are wide bandgap semiconductors. Thermal stabilities of these compounds have been investigated by thermogravimetric analyses (TGA)."
"We analyzed the association of lymph node ratio (LNR) wth locoregional control (LRC) in breast cancer patients with >= 10 involved axillary lymph nodes who underwent multimodality treatment. Methods: We retrospectively analyzed 234 breast cancer patients with 10 involved axillary lymph nodes between 2000 and 2011. All patients received adjuvant chemotherapy and radiotherapy (RT) after radical surgery. The cutoff value of LNR was obtained using receiver operating characteristic curve analysis. The majority of patients (87.2%) received chemotherapeutic regimen including taxane. RT consisted of tangential fields to the chest wall or intact breast, delivered at a median dose of 50 Gy, and a single anterior port to the supraclavicular lymph node area, delivered at a median dose of 50 Gy. For patients who underwent breast-conserving surgery, an electron boost with a total dose of 9 to15 Gy was delivered to the tumor bed. Results: Within a median follow-up period of 73.5 months (range, 11-183 months), locoregional recurrence (LRR) occurred in 30 patients (12.8%) and the 5-year LRC rate was 88.8%. After multivariate analysis, LNR >= 0.7 was the only independent factor significantly associated with LRC (hazard ratio, 2.06; 95% confidence interval, 0.99-4.29; p=0.05). Conclusion: An aggressive multimodal treatment approach showed favorable locoregional outcome in patients with 10 involved axillary lymph nodes. However, patients with a high LNR >= 0.7 still had an increased risk for LRR, even in the setting of current local treatments."
"Frequency difference limens (FDLs) were measured for Huggins pitch (HP) stimuli, consisting of a 30-Hz wide band of interaurally decorrelated noise in a diotic low-pass noise and for 30-Hz wide bands of diotic narrowband noise presented in a diotic low-pass noise background. FDLs at a 400-ms duration for the two stimulus types were equated by adjusting the level of the narrowband noise relative to the background. The effects of duration on the FDLs were then measured for center frequencies of 300, 600, and 900 Hz. Although the results were compromised by floor effects at 900 Hz, at 300 and 600 Hz, the duration effects were very similar for the HP and narrowband noise stimuli, with a large improvement in performance between 100 and 400 ms. In contrast to previous results for pure tones, the effect of duration was independent of frequency. The results suggest that: (1) Binaural and monaural pitches may be processed using a common mechanism; (2) discrimination performance for HP and low-sensation-level narrowband noise stimuli is not determined by the number of waveform periods.

"The first successful human-to-human blood transfusion was performed in the 1820s by British obstetrician James Blundell to treat a woman with post-partum hemorrhage (1). Although there had been more than 200 years of research into blood, relatively little was known at that time, and the identification of blood groups by Landsteiner was still several decades away. Animal-to-human blood transfusion had been attempted, but the failure of these experiments suspended any significant progress in the field for almost 150 years. In 1816, John Henry Leacock established the importance of species compatibility for successful transfusion (2). Blundell followed Leacock's work, and when faced with a patient who was exsanguinating, he extracted blood from the patient's husband and transfused it, saving the woman's life."
"Aim: Carotid artery disease (CAD) is an atherosclerotic inflammatory disease that affects the arterial wall, specifically at points of bifurcation where blood flow is disturbed. Abnormal blood rheology could participate in the pathophysiology of ischemic cardiovascular disease. Physical activity (PA) is known to improve blood rheology in several chronic disorders. This study aims to (i) compare the hemorheological profile of CAD patients and controls and (ii) investigate the associations between daily PA and hemorheological parameters in CAD patients. Methods: Blood viscosity, red blood cell (RBC) aggregation and RBC deformability were assessed in 80 patients (15 symptomatic and 65 asymptomatic) and 14 age-matched controls. Patients' PA levels were evaluated using questionnaires. Results: Symptomatic patients showed increased blood viscosity and RBC aggregation compared to healthy controls. RBC aggregation was significantly lower in the most physically active patients compared to the least physically active ones. Blood viscosity and RBC deformability did not vary according to physical activity level. Conclusions: Our results showed greater hemorheological abnormalities (blood hyper-viscosity and hyper-aggregation of red blood cells) in the most severe CAD patients, which could exacerbate the risk of stroke in patients with stenosis. As the most physically active patients had lower RBC aggregation than those who were less physically active, it is possible that regular PA may limit hemorheological alterations in CAD patients."
"A comprehensive community-based burn prevention framework was developed for rural Bangladesh taking into consideration the magnitude, consequences of burns, risk factors of childhood burn, health seeking behaviour of parents after a burn injury of a child and the perception of community people. This paper explains the comprehensive framework of the childhood burn prevention programme and describes its acceptability, feasibility and sustainability. A number of methodologies were adopted in developing the framework, such as, (i) building up relevant information on childhood burn and prevention methods, (ii) arranging workshops and consultation meetings with experts and related stakeholders and (iii) piloting components of the framework on a small scale. Lack of supervision of the children, hazardous environment at home and the low level awareness about childhood burn and other injuries were identified as the major attributes of childhood burn in Bangladesh. To address these factors ""Triple S"" strategies were identified for the prevention framework. These strategies are: Safe environment. Supervision. Skill development. According to these strategies, home safety, community creche, school safety, formation of community groups and general awareness activities were identified as the different components of the childhood burn prevention framework in rural Bangladesh. The framework was piloted in a small scale to explore its feasibility acceptability and sustainability. The framework was found to be acceptable by the community. It is also expected to be feasible and sustainable as very low cost and locally available technology and resources were utilized in the framework. Large scale piloting is necessary to explore its effectiveness and ability to scale up all over the whole country. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd and ISBI. All rights reserved."
"This brief presents the new simple schematic for the temperature stable current references based on the well-known beta-multiplier circuit. The proposed reference utilizes only four MOS transistors and two lateral PNP transistors, which are usually available in standard CMOS technologies along with one well resistor. The temperature-compensation technique has a low process dependence and needs no trimming. However, resistor trimming can be used to precisely set the output current value. The circuit implementation of the proposed technique was fabricated in a standard 0.35-mu m CMOS process to source a 16-mu A current. The digital calibration circuit allows setting of the output current in 32 100 nA-steps. The proposed current reference achieves the supply sensitivity of several %/V without the use of the external bandgap voltage reference for the supply regulation. The measured temperature coefficient is 105 ppm/degrees C over the temperature range from 0 to 110 degrees C."
"Islands provide classic model biological systems. We review how growing appreciation of geoenvironmental dynamics of marine islands has led to advances in island biogeographic theory accommodating both evolutionary and ecological phenomena. Recognition of distinct island geodynamics permits general models to be developed and modified to account for patterns of diversity, diversification, lineage development, and trait evolution within and across island archipelagos. Emergent patterns of diversity include predictable variation in island species-area relationships, progression rule colonization from older to younger land masses, and syndromes including loss of dispersability and secondary woodiness in herbaceous plant lineages. Further developments in Earth system science, molecular biology, and trait data for islands hold continued promise for unlocking many of the unresolved questions in evolutionary biology and biogeography."
"This paper presents an initial assessment of the possibility of structuring a sustainability certification scheme for the dimension stone industry in Brazil. A survey was conducted based on perceptions of key stakeholders with experience in Brazil's dimension stone industry and connected to it through research or institutional affiliations. Twenty-three out of twenty-six stakeholders agreed to be interviewed. Six groups of 40 questions included general and specific topics containing open-ended and multiple-choice questions on three main themes: sustainability, challenges to the sustainability, and deficiencies and omissions of the current regulatory scenario of the dimension stone industry. The findings demonstrated that participants have a positive perception about the feasibility of a sustainability certification scheme for the dimension stone industry in Espirito Santo State. Responses provided by the sample of stakeholders interviewed indicated that such a certification scheme would find support from key stakeholders and also legitimacy. In addition to this broader conclusion, other options were validated, including the agreement in the list of entities that could be part of the group relevant to the dimension stone industry. In this context, participation of public powers is essential, but in indirect participation in the scheme to avoid contamination of the balance of forces. This would support its evolution with promotion and collaboration tools, which would help solve the deficiencies of inadequate performance. More research is needed on the main challenges and impacts of such an initiative for a certification scheme. Recommendations for a preliminary model are given, based on the results of the interviews, and also on economic, social and environmental data about the dimension stone industry in Brazil and on the literature about certification schemes.

"This study examined how modern vehicle lights affect night-time taxi drivers and the relationships any effects have with headache. Sixty-eight drivers were asked about their perception of flicker, blurring, seeing double, smearing, glare, blinding, unease, discomfort, pain and headache/migraine from vehicle lights when driving at night. Participants were asked specifically about light emitting diodes, but responses may have included their experiences with other vehicle light types. Glare was the greatest problem, and red braking lights were worse than white lights around headlights. The headache group experienced greater problems, particularly for discomfort, pain, unease, flickering, seeing double and triggered headaches. Further research is needed as these effects pose potentially dangerous scenarios for all night-time road users, especially given the increased use of bright, directional light emitting diodes on vehicles and on roadsides."
A simple method for the preparation of patterned graphene electrodes by applying patterned copper film as the masking layer is demonstrated. As-prepared graphene pattern shows well-defined and straight boundary line. High-quality patterned graphene electrode possesses a low average sheet resistance of 556 Omega/sq meanwhile its transmittance exceeds 96% at 550 nm. The 4 x 2 organic light-emitting diodes array with patterned graphene electrode further proves the practical application of this simple patterned technology. Corresponding device exhibits a maximum luminance of 44 k cd/m(2) at 15 V and current efficiency of 24 cd/A at 6 V. This patterned graphene electrodes also have great potential in application of flexible printed electronics and display. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.
"Seismic analyses of nuclear facilities require the use of validated numerical models that can realistically reproduce the response of soils during earthquakes. The nested surface nonlinear, hysteretic soil constitutive model is one of the soil constitutive models that is widely used because of (1) its lower number of free parameters compared to other nonlinear soil constitutive models and (2) the ease of calibrating these parameters using the commonly available soil data, i.e., G/G(max) and damping curves, as a function of shear strain. This material model is available in the commercial finite element software packages LS-DYNA and Abaqus as well as in the open source finite element tool Mastodon. The purpose of this study is to estimate the parameters required for this material model from the soil data available for the Lotung site and to demonstrate that this nonlinear soil constitutive model used in a time domain, finite element analysis can reasonably reproduce the actual measured soil motions recorded at Lotung during the LSST07 event on May 20, 1986. Results are presented from all the three software packages mentioned above using the same material model."
"Defensive medicine is a term conventionally used for defining the medical (mal)practice of ordering medically questionable diagnostic testing, procedures, or visits, or to avoid high-risk patients or procedures. The practice of defensive medicine may primarily be aimed to reduce exposure to malpractice liability, to avoid patient criticism regarding medical inaction, or to avoid missing some otherwise potential identifiable defect(s). Although the precise impact of defensive medicine in the field of laboratory testing is difficult to estimate from the current literature, the overuse or inappropriate use of laboratory resources ranges from 23 to 67%, and a large part of this can be attributed to medical liability concerns, with apparently little clinical awareness of the adverse consequences that may be associated with this practice. Essentially, performing inappropriate testing remarkably increases the risk of obtaining false-positive results due to statistical, preanalytical, and analytical reasons, thus triggering further and potentially even more invasive follow-up testing, inappropriate patient management, along with incremental increases of expenditure due to misuse of health care resources. As routine coagulation testing is commonly performed for the screening of patients with bleeding or thrombotic disorders, either a false-negative or a false-positive result may significantly impact on clinical outcomes and health care resources. The aim of this article is to describe the leading causes of physiological, pathological, therapeutic, and spurious variations of the prothrombin time, activated partial thromboplastin time, and D-dimer, as well as the potential clinical consequences emerging from the generation of false-negative and false-positive results with these tests."
"Objectives: This study investigated the critical factors influencing the job involvement of emergency medical technicians (EMTs) of the Fire and Disaster Prevention and Rescue Bureau after it was restructured from the original National Fire Agency, and examined how they confronted continual massive disasters resulting from global climate changes and the demand for better quality rescue services. Methods: 645 Questionnaires were sent out and the responses analyzed. Results: Job negativism increased with the age, life experience and work experience of the EMT. Variables directly affecting job involvement included professional competency and training. In addition, organizations with 16-20 personnel showed greater dedication. However, the professional competency of EMT was not influenced by the constitutional differences of EMT service location. Conclusions: When drafting emergency policies, fire departments should outline appropriate job regulations and manpower distribution in order to increase job inducement and satisfaction, and provide regular training to boost professional competency. In addition, medical rescue budget should be increased to provide substantial logistical support such as ambulances and equipment. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."
"Recent studies have addressed the development of optimal control strategies for hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs). Achieving global optimality for fuel economy prediction while minimizing the computational efficiency still is a research and development challenge. This paper aims at presenting a novel technique for managing the energy flows in a power split HEV named slope-weighted energy-based rapid control analysis (SERCA). After presenting the HEV plant model and the optimal control problem, the currently most adopted energy management strategies are analyzed. The SERCA technique is then illustrated, and its operating steps are detailed. The simulation results for the considered HEV energy management strategies in the standard drive cycles subsequently indicate that the SERCA can efficiently achieve near-optimal fuel economy, while limiting the computational costs. This suggests the potential use of SERCA for rapid component sizing of HEV powertrains."
"Tidal inlets connect the ocean to inner water bodies and are present worldwide. Shallow inlets display fast morphological changes, due to complex interactions between tides, waves, and shallow depths. Their closure is commonly observed under storm waves, but the underlying processes remain only partly understood. Here, we present new field evidence that infragravity waves contribute to the closure of shallow inlets. The analysis of new field data collected at a shallow inlet under storm waves reveals that infragravity waves up to 0.4 m high can propagate inside the lagoon during flood but are blocked by opposing currents during ebb. At the passage of an infragravity wave crest, currents peak over 2.5 m/s and increase instantaneous sand fluxes by 2 orders of magnitude. Large accumulations of sand at the lagoon entrance damp tidal propagation until full inlet closure. This mechanism provides a new explanation for the closure of shallow inlets observed worldwide."
"Polymorphisms of the vitamin D receptor gene (VDR) have been associated inconsistently with various diseases, across populations of diverse origin. The T(f) allele of the functional SNP FokI, in exon 2 of VDR, results in a longer vitamin D receptor protein (VDR) isoform, proposed to be less active. Genetic association of VDR with disease is likely confounded by ethnicity and environmental factors such as plasma 25(OH)D-3 status. We hypothesized that VDR expression, VDR level and transactivation of target genes, CAMP and CYP24A1, depend on vitamin D, ethnicity and FokI genotype. Healthy volunteers participated in the study (African, n = 40 and White, n = 20). Plasma 25(OH)D-3 levels were quantified by LC-MS and monocytes cultured, with or without 1,25(OH)(2)D-3. Gene expression and protein level was quantified using qRT-PCR and flow cytometry, respectively. Mean plasma 25(OH)D-3 status was normal and not significantly different between ethnicities. Neither 25(OH)D-3 status nor 1,25(OH)(2)D-3 supplementation significantly influenced expression or level of VDR. Africans had significantly higher mean VDR protein levels (P<0.050), nonetheless transactivated less CAMP expression than Whites. Genotyping the FokI polymorphism by pyrosequencing together with HapMap data, showed a significantly higher (P<0.050) frequency of the CC genotype in Africans than in Whites. FokI genotype, however, did not influence VDR expression or VDR level, but influenced overall transactivation of CAMP and 1,25(OH)(2)D-3-elicited CYP24A1 induction; the latter, interacting with ethnicity. In conclusion, differential VDR expression relates to ethnicity, rather than 25(OH)D-3 status and FokI genotype. Instead, VDR transactivation of CAMP is influenced by FokI genotype and, together with ethnicity, influence 1,25(OH)(2)D-3-elicited CYP24A1 expression. Thus, the expression and role of VDR to transactivate target genes is determined not only by genetics, but also by ethnicity and environment involving complex interactions which may confound disease association."
"Hypervelocity micro particles (mass <1 ng), including meteoroids and space debris, routinely impact spacecraft and produce plasmas that are initially dense (similar to 10(28) m(-3)), but rapidly expand into the surrounding vacuum. We report the detection of radio frequency (RF) emission associated with electromagnetic pulses (EMPs) from hypervelocity impacts of micro particles in ground-based experiments using micro particles that are 15 orders of magnitude less massive than previously observed. The EMP production is a stochastic process that is influenced by plasma turbulence such that the EMP detection rate that is strongly dependent on impact speed and on the electrical charge conditions at the impact surface. In particular, impacts of the fastest micro particles occurring under spacecraft charging conditions representative of high geomagnetic activity are the most likely to produce RF emission. This new phenomenon may provide a source for unexplained RF measurements on spacecraft charged to high potentials. (C) 2013 AIP Publishing LLC."
"Dogs are the main domestic reservoirs of L. (L.) chagasi. Once in the vertebrate host, the parasite can cause visceral leishmaniasis, which can also be transmitted to humans. Cytokines are key elements of the host immune response against Leishmania spp. To investigate whether tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, interleukin (IL)-4 and IL-10 are associated with pattern infection in dogs, these cytokines were quantified in the spleen and liver of dogs naturally infected with L. (L.) chagasi, with or without clinical manifestations, and their levels were correlated with the parasite load verified in these organs. A total of 40 adult dogs naturally infected with L. (L.) chagasi were assessed, together with 12 uninfected control dogs. Samples from spleen and liver were used to determine the cytokine levels by capture ELISA and for quantifying parasite load by real-time PCR. Statistical analysis was performed using the minimum Chi square method and group means were compared using the Tukey test. TNF-alpha, IL-4 and IL-10 levels in infected dogs were higher than in control groups; the liver was the main cytokine-producing organ during infection. The level of splenic TNF-alpha showed correlation with parasite load and may represent an important marker for infection process evolution, with the participation of IL-10. These results may contribute to a clearer understanding of the immune response in dogs infected with L. (L.) chagasi, which may lead to the development of prophylactic or preventive measures for these animals."
"Objective: Currently, no formal practice guidelines exist regarding the use of endografts to exclude hemodialysis access pseudoaneurysms and prolong access lifespan in dialysis patients. We evaluated the efficacy of percutaneous endograft placement for exclusion of hemodialysis access pseudoaneurysms. Methods: Between July 2005 and October 2009, 32 patients were prospectively evaluated. Twenty-four patients were actively enrolled in the study based upon clinical and ultrasonographic evaluation of their hemodialysis accesses. Self-expanding covered endografts were placed percutaneously to exclude access pseudoaneurysms. Patients were evaluated at 2 and 6 months to assess for graft patency, access or outflow stenosis, endoleak, or stent graft migration. Results: No procedural complications resulted from these interventions. An average of 1.8 endografts was placed per patient, with patients requiring between 1 and 3 endografts to exclude pseudoaneurysms. Primary-assisted patency was 83% at completed 2-month follow-up and 54% at 6-month follow-up. At 12 months, primary-assisted patency was 50%. Eleven patients left the study before 6-month follow-up: five (21%) required explantation secondary to infection between 1 and 4 months; three (13%) were lost to follow-up; two (8%) died of unrelated causes; and 1 requested explantation citing pain from the ""stent poking the vein."" Mean time to explantation secondary to infection was 2.4 months. Mean duration of patency was 17.6 months with a range from 0 to 76 months. Mean duration of patency for patients who completed 6-month follow-up was 28.7 months. The longest duration of patency is 6 years 4 months, after stent fracture and subsequent placement of a new stent at 6 years 2 months. One other incident of stent fracture occurred at 36 months. Dialysis patterns were not interrupted in either patient. Conclusions: The long-term results demonstrate that endograft salvage of failing hemodialysis accesses is a viable and safe alternative to open surgical revision that excludes pseudoaneurysms while maintaining uninterrupted access patency. A larger sample size and longer follow-up are needed to support the study data. (J Vasc Surg 2013;57:137-43.)"
"Background: Although significant impairments in the affective and cognitive facets of social cognition have been highlighted in patients with 22q11.2 deletion syndrome (22q11DS) in previous studies, these domains have never been investigated simultaneously within the same group of participants. Furthermore, despite theoretical evidence, associations between these two processes and schizotypal symptoms or social difficulties in this population have been scarcely examined. Methods: Twenty-nine participants with 22q11DS and 27 typically developing controls (N = 5 siblings; N = 22 unrelated controls) aged between 11 and 21 years participated in the study. Both groups were matched for age and gender distribution. Two computerized social cognition tasks evaluating perspective and emotion recognition abilities were administered to all participants. The levels of schizotypal trait expression and social functioning were further investigated in both groups, based on a validated self-report questionnaire (Schizotypal Personality Questionnaire) and parental interview (Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales). Results: Participants with 22q11DS exhibited lower perspective-taking and emotion recognition capacities than typically developing controls. The two socio-cognitive dimensions investigated here were further correlated in healthy controls. The efficiency of perspective-taking processes (response time) was marginally related to the degree of schizotypal trait expression in patients with 22q11DS. Conclusions: This study first provides support for significant deficits in two core facets of social cognition in 22q11DS. The associations observed between the experimental tasks and measures of social functioning or schizotypal symptoms in 22q11DS open promising research avenue, which should be more deeply investigated in future studies."
"Background: Although psychological treatments for social anxiety disorder (SAD) can be highly effective, many individuals do not respond to treatment. Identifying factors associated with improved outcomes can facilitate individualized treatment choices. We investigated whether patterns of neural connectivity predicted treatment responses and whether treatment type, cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) or acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT), moderated this effect. Methods: Participants with SAD (n=34) underwent fMRI prior to treatment and completed implicit and explicit emotion regulation tasks. Neural connectivity measures were estimates of amygdala-prefrontal cortex connectivity. Treatment responder status was defined using the 'clinically significant change index' (Loerinc et al., 2015). Results: Right amygdala-right ventrolateral prefrontal cortex connectivity during implicit emotion regulation was a significant predictor of treatment response (OR=9.01, 95% CI=1.77, 46.0, p=.008). Stronger inverse connectivity was associated with greater likelihood of treatment response. There were no significant neural moderators of treatment response to CBT versus ACT. Limitations: The primary limitation of this work was the small sample size which restricted the power to detect significant moderation effects, and results should be interpreted as preliminary. Conclusions: Amygdala-vlPFC connectivity during affect labeling predicted treatment responder status following CBT or ACT for social anxiety disorder. This suggests that the functioning of neural circuitry supporting emotion regulation capacities may be a 'gateway' to receiving benefit from psychological treatments. Future work should aim to replicate this effect in a larger sample and consider methods for enhancing functional connectivity within this circuitry as a potential treatment adjunct."
"Globally, there has been a decrease in dissolved oxygen in the oceans, that is more pronounced in coastal waters, resulting in more frequent hypoxia exposure for many marine animals. Managing hypoxia requires an understanding of the dynamics of dissolved oxygen (DO) where it occurs. The French coast facing the Bay of Biscay (NE Atlantic Ocean) hosts at least a dozen tidal and turbid estuaries, but only the large estuaries of the Gironde and the Loire, are subject to a continuous monitoring. Here, we compared the DO dynamics in these two systems, in order to evaluate to what extent it is possible to predict the sensitivity to hypoxia of a tidal and turbid estuary based on its most common and easily accessible characteristics (the estuary surface area and length, liquid and solid discharge, suspended particulate load, water renewal time, presence of cities). Whereas the hyperturbid Gironde estuary is the longest (170 km), implying longer water and particle residence times, and is bordered by a large metropole (> 750,000 inhabitants), only episodic summer hypoxia events (DO < 2 mg L-1) were recorded in its urban Garonne subestuary. In contrast, the turbid Loire estuary, smaller in terms of surface area and length, experiences permanent summer hypoxia. This demonstrates the inability to evaluate the susceptibility of a tidal and turbid estuary to hypoxia only by considering its general characteristics. We urge that there is a need for a pertinent DO survey strategy based on an initial assessment of DO in a specific estuary based on longitudinal investigations, in particular during the warm season (as higher water temperatures decrease DO solubility), for detecting the potential zones of minimum DO."
"Known for years as the principal messengers of the immune system, dendritic cells (DC) represent a heterogeneous population of antigen presenting cells critically located at the nexus between innate and adaptive immunity. DC play a central role in the initiation of tumor-specific immune responses as they are endowed with the unique ability to take up, process and present tumor antigens to na < ve CD4(+) or CD8(+) effector T lymphocytes. By virtue of the cytokines they produce, DC also regulate the type, strength and duration of T cell immune responses. In addition, they can participate in anti-tumoral NK and NKT cell activation and in the orchestration of humoral immunity. More recent studies have documented that besides their primary role in the induction and regulation of adaptive anti-tumoral immune responses, DC are also endowed with the capacity to directly kill cancer cells. This dual role of DC as killers and messengers may have important implications for tumor immunotherapy. First, the direct killing of malignant cells by DC may foster the release and thereby the immediate availability of specific tumor antigens for presentation to cytotoxic or helper T lymphocytes. Second, DC may participate in the effector phase of the immune response, potentially augmenting the diversity of the killing mechanisms leading to tumor elimination. This review focuses on this non-conventional cytotoxic function of DC as it relates to the promotion of cancer immunity and discusses the potential application of killer DC (KDC) in tumor immunotherapy."
"Scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy experiments under ultrahigh vacuum and low-temperature conditions have been performed on water-intercalated graphene on Pt(111). We find that the confined water layer, with a thickness around 0.35 nm, induces a strong hole doping in graphene, i.e., the Dirac point locates at round 0.64 eV above the Fermi level. This can be explained by the presence of a single ""puckered bilayer"" of ice-Ih, which has not been experimentally found on bare Pt(111), being confined in between graphene and Pt(111) surface. Moreover, the water intercalation makes graphene highly decoupled from the substrate, allowing us to reveal the intrinsic graphene phonons and double Rydberg series of even and odd symmetry image-potential states. Our work not only demonstrates that the electronic properties of graphene can be tuned by the confined water layer between graphene and the substrate, but also provides a generally applicable method to study the intrinsic properties of graphene as well as of other supported two-dimensional materials."
"Background: The characterization of structural variations (SV) such as insertions, deletions and copy number variations is a critical step in the process of understanding the full genetic architecture of organisms. Copy number variations (CNV) have attracted much recent attention due to their effects on gene expression and disease status. Results: In this paper, we present a method that utilizes next-generation sequencing technologies (NGS), in order to both detect and reconstruct CNVs. We focus on a special type of CNV, namely tandemly organized de novo CNVs, which have been shown to occur with high frequency in the mouse genome. Conclusions: We apply our method to CNV regions randomly inserted into the reference mouse genome and show that our method achieves good performance for both detection and reconstruction of tandemly organized de novo CNVs."
"The relative role of density-dependent and density-independent variation in vital rates and population size remains largely unsolved. Despite its importance to the theory and application of population ecology, and to conservation biology, quantifying the role and strength of density dependence is particularly challenging. We present a hierarchical formulation of the temporal symmetry approach, also known as the Pradel model, that permits estimation of the strength of density dependence from capture-mark-reencounter data. A measure of relative population size is built in the model and serves to detect density dependence directly on population growth rate. The model is also extended to account for temporal random variability in demographic rates, allowing estimation of the temporal variance of population growth rate unexplained by density dependence. We thus present a model-based approach that enable to test and quantify the effect of density-dependent and density-independent factors affecting population fluctuations in a single modeling framework. More generally, we use this modeling framework along with simulated and empirical data to show the value of including density dependence when modeling individual encounter data without the need for auxiliary data."
"Phase relations in Fe-5 wt%Ni-4 wt%Si alloy was examined in an internally resistive heated diamond anvil cell under high pressure (P) and temperature (T) conditions to about 200 GPa and 3900 K by in-situ synchrotron X-ray diffraction. The hexagonal close-packed (hcp) structure was observed to the highest P-T condition, supporting the idea that the stable iron alloy structure in Earth's inner core is hcp. The P-T locations of the phase transition between the face-centred cubic (fcc) and hcp structures were also constrained to 106 GPa. The transition occurs at 15 GPa and 1000 K similar to for pure Fe. The Clausius-Clapeyron slope is however, 0.0480 GPO( which is larger than reported slopes for Fe (0.0394 GPa/K), Fe-9.7 wt%Ni (0.0426 GPa/K), and Fe-4 wt%Si (0.0394 GPa/K), stabilising the fcc structure towards high pressure. Thus the simultaneous addition of Ni and Si to Fe increases the dP/dT slope of the fcc-hcp transition. This is associated with a small volume change upon transition in Fe-Ni-Si. The triple point, where the fcc, hcp, and liquid phases coexist in Fe-5 wt%Ni-4 wt%Si is placed at 145 GPa and 3750 K. The resulting melting temperature of the hcp phase at the inner core-outer core boundary lies at 550 K lower than in pure Fe. (C) 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V."
"Patients who present to the emergency department (ED) with return of spontaneous circulation after cardiac arrest generally have poor outcomes. Guidelines for treatment can be complicated and difficult to implement. This study examined the feasibility of implementing a care bundle including therapeutic hypothermia (TH) and early hemodynamic optimization for comatose patients with return of spontaneous circulation after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest. The study included patients over a 2-year period in the ED and intensive care unit of an academic tertiary-care medical center. The first year (prebundle) provided a historical control, followed by a prospective observational period of bundle implementation during the second year. The bundle elements included (a) TH initiated; (b) central venous pressure/central venous oxygen saturation monitoring in 2 h; (c) target temperature in 4 h; (d) central venous pressure greater than 12 mmHg in 6 h; (e) MAP greater than 65 mmHg in 6 h; (f) central venous oxygen saturation greater than 70% in 6 h; (g) TH maintained for 24 h; and (h) decreasing lactate in 24 h. Fifty-five patients were enrolled, 26 patients in the prebundle phase and 29 patients in the bundle phase. Seventy-seven percent of bundle elements were completed during the bundle phase. In-hospital mortality in bundle compared with prebundle patients was 55.2% vs. 69.2% (P = 0.29). In the bundle patients, those patients who received all elements of the care bundle had mortality 33.3% compared with 60.9% in those receiving some of the bundle elements (P = 0.22). Bundle patients tended to achieve good neurologic outcome compared with prebundle patients, Cerebral Performance Category 1 or 2 in 31 vs. 12% patients, respectively (P = 0.08). Our study demonstrated that a post-cardiac arrest care bundle that incorporates TH and early hemodynamic optimization can be implemented in the ED and intensive care unit collaboratively and can achieve similar clinical benefits compared with those observed in previous clinical trials."
"Objective: Restless legs syndrome is characterised by discomfort during rest and an urge to move the limbs that is accompanied by abnormal sensations. Studies on disease pathophysiology have focused on dopaminergic dysfunction. Vitamin D may play an important role in dopamine function, but the role of vitamin Din restless legs syndrome has not been examined. We compared the serum vitamin D levels of RLS patients and matched controls and explored the correlation of plasma vitamin D levels with disease severity. Patients/methods: We measured serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels in 36 patients with restless legs syndrome and compared them to 38 healthy control subjects. Results: The mean serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels were 7.31 +/- 4.63 ng/mL in female patients with restless legs syndrome and 12.31 +/- 5.27 ng/mL in female control subjects (p = 0.001). We found a significant inverse correlation between vitamin D levels and disease severity in females (p = 0.01, r = -0.47). Conclusion: The mean serum vitamin D levels were lower in female patients with restless legs syndrome. Low vitamin D levels may cause dopaminergic dysfunction in restless legs syndrome patients. Further studies are required to confirm these results. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."
"The development of quantum network relies on high-quality entanglement between remote quantum nodes. In reality the unavoidable decoherence limits the quality of entangled quantum nodes, however, entanglement distillation can overcome this problem. Here we propose an experimentally feasible scheme of continuous-variable entanglement generation, storage, and distillation between distant quantum nodes, which only requires the atomic ensemble quantum memory and balanced homodyne detection (BHD). Initially one copy of a bipartite entangled state of light, suffering phase fluctuations during the distributions, is stored in two distant atomic ensembles so that the atomic ensembles are entangled. Within the storage lifetime, by distributing and storing another copy of entangled optical modes in these two atomic ensembles, the distillation on entangled atomic spin waves can be implemented based on the post-selection of the BHD result. Our scheme provides a highly entangled state between remote quantum nodes for downstream applications, and enables the extension to multipartite entanglement distillation in a large-scale quantum network."
"DNA sequences with nontrivial intrinsic curvature are of interest for a range of biological and artificial DNA systems. We design both intrinsically strongly curved and intrinsically straight sequences. We find that such sequences with opposing curvatures can be designed even under constraints that would naively lead one to assume that those sequences would be highly similar in their mechanical properties. We then characterize the force response of those sequences and find that their force-extension curves deviate significantly in the low-force regime, and that the standard worm-like chain description is inadequate to describe the low-force response of the strongly bent sequences. We propose a modified description that takes the intrinsic curvature into account, making the DNA act, in the low-force regime, like a nanoscale helical spring. We find strongly improved agreement between the model and the simulated force-extension curves. Copyright (C) EPLA, 2016"
"Background: Cytomegalovirus (CMV) colitis can contribute to an unfavorable outcome of acute severe ulcerative colitis (ASUC). The purpose of this study was to evaluate the clinical outcomes of ASUC according to the CMV status and identify risk factors for CMV colitis in patients with ASUC. Methods: We retrospectively analyzed patients with ASUC from 2011 to 2014 according to the criteria of Truelove and Witts. CMV colitis was diagnosed by histopathological and/or immunohistochemical analysis of tissue samples. The risk factors for CMV colitis were investigated and clinical outcomes were assessed using the rate of rescue therapy and colectomy. Results: Of 149 patients with ASUC, 50 (33.6%) were diagnosed with CMV colitis. During admission, 16 of 149 patients (10.7%) underwent colectomy: 7 of 50 (14.0%) in the ASUC-CMV group versus 9 of 99 (9.1%) in the ASUC-only group (P = 0.364). The need for rescue therapy was 2.28-fold higher in the ASUC-CMV group than in the ASUC-only group in multivariate analysis (95% confidence interval, 1.10-4.72). Multivariate analysis also revealed that recent use of high-dose steroids (odds ratio, 3.30; 95% confidence interval, 1.33-8.19) and a higher Mayo score (odds ratio, 1.58; 95% confidence interval, 1.05-2.38) were risk factors for CMV colitis. Conclusions: CMV colitis often occurs in ASUC, particularly in patients who have recently been treated with high-dose steroids and have a higher Mayo score on admission. Patients with ASUC and CMV colitis seem to have a poorer prognosis, as indicated by the greater need for rescue therapy."
"Background/Aims: Appropriate drainage management after pancreaticoduodenectomy (PD) is important to prevent and manage serious complications. This prospective study evaluated postoperative complications with either closed or open drainage placement after PD. Methodology: The incidence of postoperative complications in patients of PD, assigned to 2 groups of closed- and open-drain systems based on assessment periods, were investigated using propensity scores matching (PSM) after accounting for potential covariates. Results: Baseline characteristics were comparable in both groups of patients (n=100; open, 36; closed, 64). Pancreatic fistulae requiring clinical treatment, and wound infection, were found in 33.3% and 15.6%, and 22.2% and 0%, of patients in open- and closed-drainage groups, respectively. Drainage fluid culture showed exogenous infection (63.6% of bacteria) in the open-drain group which was absent in the closed-drainage group. PSM cohorts had 26 patients in either group. Following PSM, pancreatic fistulae requiring treatment were found in 12/26 (46.2%) and 3/26 (11.5%) of patients in the open- and closed-drain groups (RR, 0.25, 95% CI, 0.08-0.81), respectively. Intra-abdominal abscess (5/26 [19.2%]) and wound infection (7/26 [26.9%]) were found in the open-drain group only. Conclusion: These results indicate postoperative retrograde infections may be prevented, and the incidence of pancreatic fistula reduced, with a closed drainage system."
"Background: Patients with ulcerative colitis (UC) who are in clinical remission may still have underlying endoscopic inflammation, which is associated with inferior clinical outcomes. The goal of this study was to determine the prevalence of active endoscopic disease, and factors associated with it, in patients with UC who are in clinical remission. Methods: Prospective observational study in a single center. Patients with UC in clinical remission (by Simple Clinical Colitis Activity Index) were enrolled prospectively at the time of surveillance colonoscopy. Disease phenotype, endoscopic activity (Mayo subscore), and histologic score (Geboes) were recorded, and blood was drawn for peripheral blood biomarkers. Results: Overall, 149 patients in clinical remission were prospectively enrolled in this cohort; 81% had been in clinical remission for >6 months, and 86% were currently prescribed maintenance medications. At endoscopy, 45% of patients in clinical remission had any endoscopic inflammation (Mayo endoscopy subscore >0), and 13% had scores >1. In a multivariate model, variables independently associated with a Mayo endoscopic score >1 were remission for <6 months (P = 0.001), white blood count (P = 0.01), and C-reactive protein level (P = 0.009). A model combining these 3 variables had a sensitivity of 94% and a specificity of 73% for predicting moderate-to-severe endoscopic activity in patients in clinical remission (area under the curve, 0.86). In an unselected subgroup of patients who had peripheral blood mononuclear cell messenger RNA profiling, GATA3 messenger RNA levels were significantly higher in patients with endoscopic activity. Conclusions: Duration of clinical remission, white blood count, and C-reactive protein level can predict the probability of ongoing endoscopic activity, despite clinical remission in patients with UC. These parameters could be used to identify patients who require intensification of treatment to achieve mucosal healing. (Inflamm Bowel Dis 2013;19:779-784)"
"In the last two decades the search for ethnicity through material culture has enjoyed a renewed boom in Archaeology. This process, which goes hand in hand with a reformulation of the concept in the Social Sciences, has led to a reconsideration of how the phenomenon itself is conceived as well as the possibilities of exploring it in groups from the past. This article attempts to make a contribution to the task of ""rethinking"" ethnicity in three steps: first a historiographic approach to the subject; second, a series of theoretical-methodological conclusions that will help in the ongoing task of constructing an ""archaeology of ethnicity""; and, finally, a reflection on the period where these approaches have generated most interest: Protohistory."
"Individuals diagnosed with a depressive disorder have been found to show reduced reactions to emotional information consistent with the hypothesis of an emotional context insensitivity. However, there are contradictory findings of enhanced reactivity and mood-congruent processing. Electroencephalography (EEG) recordings of the late positive potential (LPP) can display such blunted or enhanced activity. Due to these contradictory findings, there is a need to clarify the role of the LPP in the emergence and presence of depressive disorders especially in children. We used an emotional Go/NoGo task to investigate modulations of the LPP to emotional (fearful, happy, sad) and calm faces in a sample of children and adolescents (age 11;00-14;11) diagnosed with a depressive disorder according to diagnostic parent interviews (K-SADS-PL) (n=26) compared to a group of age-matched healthy controls (n=26). LPP positivity was attenuated in children and adolescents with a depressive disorder as well as with higher self-reported depressive symptoms, suggesting reduced reactivity to emotional and calm faces. This is the first study to find generally blunted LPP responses in a clinical sample of depressed youth across reporters. Such dysfunctional modulation of neural activity may represent a potential biomarker for depressive disorders. The results call for further prospective studies investigating the course of the LPP before and after the onset of a depressive disorder in youth."
"ZrO2 fibers were fabricated by sol-gel and electrospinning techniques for use in dye-sensitized solar cells (DSCs). The addition of ZrO2 fibers into TiO2 electrodes provides good dye loading and an effective electron pathway to increase the charge transfer in the TiO2/electrolyte interface over conventional TiO2 electrode. Photo-electrochemical properties of TiO2-ZrO2 fiber composite electrodes and the performance of resultant DSCs were determined from their photovoltaic-current densities. Energy conversion efficiency of DSCs with a TiO2-ZrO2-700 composite electrode was 6.2%, an increase of 26.5% than pure TiO2 electrode of 4.9%. The electron recombination times of the pure TiO2 and TiO2-ZrO2-700 electrode were 15.94 and 21.69 ms, respectively. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."
"Twelve Salpichroa taxa have been phytochemically analyzed. From the aerial parts of S.scandens, four known salpichrolides A, C, I, S, and an unreported withanolide named salpichrolide V (1), were isolated. In S.dependens, S.gayi, S.glandulosa subsp. glandulosa, S.glandulosa subps. weddellii, S.leucantha, S.micrantha, S.microloba, S.proboscidea, S.ramosissima, S.tristis var. tristis, and S.weberbauerii, no withanolides were found. The chemical content of ca. 85% of the Salpichroa taxa is in agreement with molecular studies, which suggest that Salpichroa and Jaborosa, a genus considered morphologically close to Salpichroa, are distant in the systematic of the Solanoideae subfamily. Moreover, the invitro cytotoxic activity of a set of natural salpichrolides and derivatives was examined against two prostate carcinoma cell lines (PC3 and LNCaP) and two human breast cancer cell lines (MCF-7 and T47D). Several compounds showed moderate activity (IC50=64.91-29.97m)."
"The current study examined the movement kinematics of older adults when aiming to vertically oriented targets. Late middle-age and early old-age participants completed 20 trials to a small target located downward or upward by 0.16 m from a home position at shoulder height. Aiming direction had a significant effect, resulting in more submovements, which were mostly reflective of undershooting when aiming to the downward compared to upward target. In trials containing a submovement, both groups exhibited shorter total movement time, concomitant with a decrease in duration of the primary movement and an increase in submovement amplitude, when aiming to the downward target. Measures of dispersion also differed in accord with the amplitude of submovements, such that there was greater spatial and temporal variability in the primary movement when aiming in the downward direction. While there was limited evidence of a difference between the groups, there were significant correlations between age and several dependent measures when aiming to the downward target. Of note, in trials containing submovements, older participants exhibited larger amplitude and longer duration submovements, as well as shorter amplitude primary movement. Spatial variability at peak velocity also increased as a function of age when aiming downward, but not in trials without submovements. An explanation related to physical limits on movement production is discounted given the lack of consistent findings between trial types. Instead, we suggest older participants' exhibit strategic differences in movement kinematics when aiming to vertically located targets, and that these change progressively with age in order to maintain speed-accuracy relations."
"Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic debilitating autoimmune disease affecting people worldwide. Increasing numbers of RA patients in the west are resorting to various complementary and alternative medicine modalities for relief of symptoms and well-being. Herbal products and acupuncture representing traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) are two of the most commonly used forms of complementary and alternative medicine. Frequently, their efficacy against RA and safety have been inferred from anecdotal experience or pilot testing on a relatively small number of patients following inadequate study designs. Accordingly, significant efforts need to be invested in objectively testing TCM in clinical trials that are sufficiently powered, randomized, blinded, possess appropriate controls and follow standard criteria for assessment of the outcomes. In addition, the mechanisms underlying the immunomodulatory and other antiarthritic activities of TCM modalities need to be better defined. These efforts would help validate the scientific rationale for the use of TCM for the management of RA."
"Two types of novel amphiphilic graft copolymers were synthesized by macromonomer method, and the copolymers were composed of 2-hydroxyethyl acrylate (HEA) or 2-methoxyethyl acrylate (MEA) along with macromonomers with amorphous poly(trimethylene carbonate) (PTMC) and biocompatible poly(ethylene glycol) monomethyl ether (mPEG) segments. The copolymers prepared exhibited low glass transition temperatures, where the mobility of the PTMC segment was high at room temperature. The synthesized polymers were further spin-coated onto a glass substrate, and the polymer-coated surfaces were evaluated using static contact angle measurement. The initial contact angle was influenced by change in the composition ratio of the PTMC macromonomer. However, the wettability of the polymer membrane could be rapidly and reversibly changed from hydrophobic to more hydrophilic upon varying its external environment such as its immersion into different solvents. These results indicated that the copolymer containing PTMC and mPEG segments regulated the surface wettability of its main chain polymer and composition ratio of the macromonomer. This change in wettability most likely occurred due to the mobility of the flexible PTMC segments in the copolymer. Therefore, this copolymer with rapid surface responsiveness has the potential to be used as a surface modifier in biomaterial fields. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."
"Influenza viruses continuously undergo antigenic changes with gradual accumulation of mutations in hemagglutinin (HA) that is a major determinant in subtype specificity. The identification of conserved epitopes within specific HA subtypes gives an important clue for developing new vaccines and diagnostics. We produced and characterized nine monoclonal antibodies that showed significant neutralizing activities against H1 subtype influenza viruses, and determined the complex structure of HA derived from a 2009 pandemic virus A/Korea/01/2009 (KR01) and the Fab fragment from H1-specific monoclonal antibody GC0587. The overall structure of the complex was essentially identical to the previously determined KR01 HA-Fab0757 complex structure. Both Fab0587 and Fab0757 recognize readily accessible head regions of HA, revealing broadly shared and conserved antigenic determinants among H1 subtypes. The beta-strands constituted by Ser110-Glu115 and Lys169-Lys170 form H1 epitopes with distinct conformations from those of H1 and H3 HA sites. In particular, Glu112, Glu115, Lys169, and Lys171 that are highly conserved among H1 subtype HAs have close contacts with HCDR3 and LCDR3. The differences between Fab0587 and Fab0757 complexes reside mainly in HCDR3 and LCDR3, providing distinct antigenic determinants specific for 1918 pdm influenza strain. Our results demonstrate a potential key neutralizing epitope important for H1 subtype specificity in influenza virus."
"Dengue virus (DENV) circulates in human and sylvatic cycles. Sylvatic strains are both ecologically and evolutionarily distinct from endemic viruses. Although sylvatic dengue cycles occur in West African countries and Malaysia, only a few cases of mild human disease caused by sylvatic strains and one single case of dengue hemorrhagic fever in Malaysia have been reported. Here we report a case of dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) with thrombocytopenia (13000/mu l), a raised hematocrit (32% above baseline) and mucosal bleeding in a 27-year-old male returning to Spain in November 2009 after visiting his home country Guinea Bissau. Sylvatic DENV-2 West African lineage was isolated from blood and sera. This is the first case of DHF associated with sylvatic DENV-2 in Africa and the second case worldwide of DHF caused by a sylvatic strain."
"Texture information plays an important role in image analysis. Although several descriptors have been proposed to extract and analyze texture, the development of automatic systems for image interpretation and object recognition is a difficult task due to the complex aspects of texture. Scale is an important information in texture analysis, since a same texture can be perceived as different texture patterns at distinct scales. Gray level co-occurrence matrices (GLCM) have been proved to be an effective texture descriptor. This paper presents a novel strategy for extending the GLCM to multiple scales through two different approaches, a Gaussian scale-space representation, which is constructed by smoothing the image with larger and larger low-pass filters producing a set of smoothed versions of the original image, and an image pyramid, which is defined by sampling the image both in space and scale. The performance of the proposed approach is evaluated by applying the multi-scale descriptor on five benchmark texture data sets and the results are compared to other well-known texture operators, including the original GLCM, that even though faster than the proposed method, is significantly outperformed in accuracy.

"Natural and anthropogenic impacts such as terrestrial runoff, influence the water quality along the coast of the Great Barrier Reef (GBR) and may in turn affect coral reef communities. Associated bacterial biofilms respond rapidly to environmental conditions and are potential bioindicators for changes in water quality. As a prerequisite to study the effects of water quality on biofilm communities, appropriate biofilm substrates for deployment in the field must be developed and evaluated. This study investigates the effect of different settlement substrates (i.e. glass slides, ceramic tiles, coral skeletons and reef sediments) on bacterial biofilm communities grown in situ for 48 days at two locations in the Whitsunday Island Group (Central GBR) during two sampling times. Bacterial communities associated with the biofilms were analysed using terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (T-RFLP) and clone library analyses of 16S rRNA genes. Findings revealed that substrate type had little influence on bacterial community composition. Of particular relevance, glass slides and coral skeletons exhibited very similar communities during both sampling times, suggesting the suitability of standardized glass slides for long-term biofilm indicator studies in tropical coral reef ecosystems."
"In this letter, we present results on the pulsed operation of a distributed Bragg reflector ridge waveguide diode laser with wavelength close to 1120 nm. Picosecond optical pulses were generated by gain-switching at variable repetition frequencies up to 80 MHz. In single-pulse operation, a pulse width of 92 ps with a pulse peak power of 1.7 W at 10 MHz could be obtained. Investigations in operation at higher injection current pulse amplitude increased the pulse peak power to 2.6 W, but also showed significant trailing pulses which is typical for gain-switched diode lasers. The shape of the pulses is stable over the whole range of the investigated repetition frequencies from 5 to 80 MHz. At an operation temperature of 25 degrees C, the emitted radiation has a wavelength of 1114.7 nm and increases to 1116.4 nm at 45 degrees C. The central wavelength does not change significantly at higher output power."
"The offshore wind industry is expanding rapidly around the world due to several factors enabling this source of renewable energy. Stronger wind resources in offshore areas, lack of social and geographical constraints related to onshore wind power, the evolution of technology, and increasing demand for electricity in coastal regions as a result of a massive increase in population are some of the factors favoring the use of wind energy. The assessment of the potential global capacity that considers the different economic, environmental, and social factors and the dynamics of market, policy, and technology are vital for estimating the competitiveness of offshore wind energy in the future energy profile. There are several studies and technical reports that evaluate the potential of offshore wind energy in different countries or regions. They used a different source of data, metrics, and quantitative approaches in appraising the potential offshore wind power capacity and its cost efficiency. The critical factors that have been considered are geographical, technical, economic, environmental, and social and market elements. This paper provides a systematic review for analyzing the studies that address the potential offshore wind energy around the world and published during the 2000-2016 period. This study highlights the key criteria for assessing the potential for offshore wind energy deployment and the related tools and methods. Published by AIP Publishing."
This paper presents a detailed finite element simulation of the longitudinal rib welds of Vessel Advanced Technology Segment (VATS) by e-beam welding. Nine different simulation sequences were carried out to explain the different mechanisms that drive the distortions process during welding and to lead to an optimum sequence which minimizes the final distortions. The simulations were used to guide the manufacture of the final sequence of the VATS. Distortion measurements taken after welding compared very well with the simulated results. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

"BACKGROUND: In human cardiac ventricle, I-K1 is mainly comprised Kir2.1, but Kir2.2 and Kir2.3 heterotetramers occur and modulate I-K1. Long-QT syndrome-9-associated CAV3 mutations cause decreased Kir2.1 current density, but Kir2.x heterotetramers have not been studied. Here, we determine the effect of long-QT syndrome-9-CAV3 mutation F97C on Kir2.x homo- and heterotetramers and model-associated arrhythmia mechanisms. METHODS AND RESULTS: Super-resolution microscopy, co-immunoprecipitation, cellular electrophysiology, on-cell Western blotting, and simulation of Purkinje and ventricular myocyte mathematical models were used. Kir2.x isoforms have unique subcellular colocalization in human cardiomyocytes and coimmunoprecipitate with Cav3. F97C-Cav3 decreased peak inward Kir2.2 current density by 50% (-120 mV; P=0.019) and peak outward by 75% (-40 mV; P<0.05) but did not affect Kir2.3 current density. FRET (Forster resonance energy transfer) efficiency for Kir2.2 with Cav3 is high, and on-cell Western blotting demonstrates decreased Kir2.2 membrane expression with F97C-Cav3. Cav3-F97C reduced peak inward and outward current density of Kir2.2/Kir2.1 or Kir2.2/Kir2.3 heterotetramers (P<0.05). Only Cav3 scaffolding and membrane domains co-immunoprecipitation with Kir2.1 and Kir2.2 and Kir2.x-N-terminal Cav3 binding motifs are required for interaction. Mathematical Purkinje, but not ventricular, myocyte model incorporating simulated current reductions, predicts spontaneous delayed after-depolarization-mediated triggered activity. CONCLUSIONS: Kir2.x isoforms have a unique intracellular pattern of distribution in association with specific Cav3 domains and that critically depends on interaction with N-terminal Kir2.x Cav3-binding motifs. Long-QT syndrome-9-CAV3 mutation differentially regulates current density and cell surface expression of Kir2.x homomeric and heteromeric channels. Mathematical Purkinje cell model incorporating experimental findings suggests delayed after-depolarization-type triggered activity as a possible arrhythmia mechanism."

"Discretization of a continuous-valued symptom (attribute) in medical data set is a crucial preprocessing step for the medical classification task. This paper proposes a supportive attribute-assisted discretization (SAAD) model for medical diagnostic problems. The intent of this approach is to discover the best supportive symptom that correlates closely with the continuous-valued symptom being discretized and to conduct the discretization process using the significant supportive information that is provided by the best supportive symptom, because we hypothesize that a good discretization scheme should rely heavily on the interaction between a continuous-valued attribute and both its supportive attribute and the class attribute. SAAD can consider each continuous-valued symptom differently and intelligently, which allows it to be capable of minimizing the information lost and the data uncertainty. Hence, SAAD results in higher classification accuracy. Empirical experiments using ten real-life datasets from the UCI repository were conducted to compare the classification accuracy achieved by several prestigious classifiers with SAAD and other state-of-the-art discretization approaches. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and usefulness of the proposed approach in enhancing the diagnostic accuracy."
"In this study, we investigated the role of eukaryotic translation initiation factor 3 subunit G (EIF3G) in colorectal cancer. Immunohistochemical analysis showed higher EIF3G expression in stage IV human colorectal cancer tissues than in adjacent normal tissues (P<0.01). EIF3G short hairpin RNA (shRNA) knockdown in HCT116 colon cancer cells reduced proliferation and increased apoptosis as compared to control. EIF3G knockdown also increased autophagy and reduced mTOR signaling, as evidenced by low phospho-AKT, phospho-S6K and phospho-4EBP1 levels. Functional experiments indicated that overexpression of EIF3G promoted HCT-116 cells proliferation, migration and xenograft tumor growth. Finally, we observed lower xenograft tumor weights and volumes with EIF3G-silenced HCT116 cells than with control cells. These findings demonstrate that EIF3G promotes colon cancer growth and is a potential therapeutic target."
"We prove the existence of symmetric homoclinic orbits to a saddle-focus symmetric periodic orbit that appears in a generic family of reversible three degrees of freedom Hamiltonian system due to periodic Hamiltonian Hopf bifurcation, if some coefficient A of the normal form of the fourth order is positive. If this coefficient is negative, then for the opposite side of the bifurcation parameter value, we prove the existence of symmetric homoclinic orbits to saddle invariant 2-tori."
"PurposeEpithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) can contribute to gastric cancer (GC) progression and recurrence following therapy. Tumor-associated neutrophils (TANs) are associated with poor outcomes in a variety of cancers. However, it is not clear whether TANs interact with the EMT process during GC development.MethodsImmunohistochemistry was performed to examine the distribution and levels of CD66+neutrophils in samples from 327 patients with GC. CD66b+TANs were isolated either directly from GC cell suspensions or were conditioned from healthy donor peripheral blood polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMNs) stimulated with tumor tissue culture supernatants (TTCS) and placed into co-culture with MKN45 or MKN74 cells, after which migration, invasion and EMT were measured. Interleukin-17a (IL-17a) was blocked with a polyclonal antibody, and the STAT3 pathway was blocked with the specific inhibitor AG490.ResultsNeutrophils were widely distributed in gastric tissues of patients with GC and were enriched predominantly at the invasion margin. Neutrophil levels at the invasion margin were an independent predictor of poor disease-free survival (DFS) and disease-specific survival (DSS). IL-17a+neutrophils constituted a large portion of IL-17a-producing cells in GC, and IL-17a was produced at the highest levels in co-culture compared with that in TANs not undergoing co-culture. TANs enhanced the migration, invasion and EMT of GC cells through the secretion of IL-17a, which activated the Janus kinase 2/signal transducers and activators of transcription (JAK2/STAT3) pathway in GC cells, while deprivation of IL-17a using a neutralizing antibody or inhibition of the JAK2/STAT3 pathway with AG490 markedly reversed these TAN-induced phenotypes in GC cells induced by TANs.ConclusionsNeutrophils correlate with tumor stage and predict poor prognosis in GC. TANs produce IL-17a, which promotes EMT of GC cells through JAK2/STAT3 signalling. Blockade of IL-17a signalling with a neutralizing antibody inhibits TAN-stimulated activity in GC cells. Therefore, IL-17a-targeted therapy might be used to treat patients with GC."
"Surface ionization (SI) provides a simple, sensitive, and selective method for the detection of high-proton affinity substances, such as organic decay products, medical and illicit drugs as well as a range of other hazardous materials. Tests on different kinds of SI sensors showed that the sensitivity and selectivity of such devices is not only dependent on the stoichiometry and nanomorphology of the emitter materials, but also on the shape of the electrode configurations that are used to read out the SI signals. Whereas, in parallel-plate capacitor devices, different kinds of emitter materials exhibit a high level of amine-selectivity, MEMS (micro-electro-mechanical-systems) and NEMS (nanowire) versions of SI sensors employing the same kinds of emitter materials provide significantly higher sensitivity, however, at the expense of a reduced chemical selectivity. In this paper, it is argued that such sensitivity-selectivity trade-offs arise from unselective physical ionization phenomena that occur in the high-field regions immediately adjacent to the surfaces of sharply curved MEMS (NEMS) emitter and collector electrodes."
"Most existing house price index construction methods are developed mainly based on transaction data from the secondary housing market, and are not necessarily suitable for the nascent housing markets where a predominant portion of housing transactions are new units. Using the booming market in China as an example, we evaluate and compare the performances of three most common house price measurement methods in the newly-built housing sector, including the simple average method without quality adjustment, the matching approach with the repeat sales modeling framework, and the hedonic modeling approach. Our analyses suggest that the simple average method fails to account for the substantial complex-level quality changes over time of sales during our sample period, and the matching model fails to control for the effect of developers' pricing behaviors when adopted in the newly-built sector, hence both are downward biased. Based on this finding, we apply a hedonic method, which allows us to control for both quality changes over time of sales and developers' pricing behaviors, to 35 major newly-built housing markets and provide the first multi-city constant-quality house price index in China. The new index reveals that the current Chinese housing market is facing a greater risk of mispricing than reported by the existing official metrics."
"Boundary-dependent corrections to the spin energy eigenvalues of an electron in a weak magnetic field and confined by a harmonic trapping potential are investigated. The electromagnetic field is quantized through a normal-mode expansion obeying the Maxwell boundary conditions at the material surface. We couple the electron to this photon field and a classical magnetic field in the Dirac equation, to which we apply the unitary Foldy-Wouthuysen transformation in order to generate a nonrelativistic approximation of the Hamiltonian to the desired order. We obtain the Schrodinger eigenstates of an electron subject to double confinement by a harmonic potential and a classical magnetic field, and then use these within second-order perturbation theory to calculate the spin energy shift that is attributable to the surface-modified quantized field. We find that a pole at the eigenfrequency of a set of generalized Landau transitions gives dominant oscillatory contributions to the energy shift in the limit of tight harmonic confinement in a weak magnetic field, which also make the energy shift preferable to the magnetic moment for a physically meaningful interpretation."
"Identification of hydrologic homogeneous regions (HHR) facilitates prioritization of watershed management measures. In this study, a new methodology involving a combination of self-organizing features maps (SOFM) method and fuzzy C-means algorithm (FCM), designated as SOMFCM, is presented to identify HHRs. The case study region is Walnut Gulch Experimental Watershed (WGEW) located in Arizona. The input data consisted of a number of factors that influence runoff generation processes, including ten surface features as well as various rainfall values corresponding to 25, 50, and 100 years return periods. Factor analysis (FA) was applied for the selection of effective surface features along with rainfall value, used in the clustering algorithm. Validation procedure indicated that the best clustering scenario was achieved through merging three layers including TPI (topographic position index), CN (curve number), and P50 (50-year rainfall). The optimum number of clusters turned out to be six while the fuzzification parameter became 1.6. The presented methodology may be proposed as a simple approach for identifying HHRs."
"We demonstrate a new approach to pattern transfer for bottom-up nanofabrication. We show that DNA promotes/inhibits the etching of SiO2 at the single-molecule level, resulting in negative/positive tone pattern transfers from DNA to the SiO2 substrate."
"Background/objectives: The impairment of the immune system is prevalent in patients with malignancies, including pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). The present study aimed to evaluate alternations of peripheral lymphocyte subsets in patients with PDAC, and also to assess the prognostic value of observed changes. Methods: We recruited 160 consecutive PDAC patients who had undergone radical surgical resection between 2010 and 2013. To investigate the prognostic factors, we detected the peripheral lymphocyte subsets in PDAC by flow cytometry, including T cells (CD3(+), CD3(+)CD4(+), CD3(+)CD8(+), CD8(+)CD28(+)), regulatory T cells (Tregs, CD4(+)CD25(+)CD127(-)), natural killer cells (NK cells, CD3(-)CD56(+)) and B cells (CD19(+)). We also evaluated the clinical and pathological features of these patients. Survival analysis was performed by univariate and multivariate analyses. Results: Our results indicated the profile of peripheral lymphocyte subsets undergone profound changes in PDAC patients. Univariate and multivariate analysis indicated the levels of peripheral lymphocyte subsets (CD19(+) B cells, Tregs and CD8(+)CD28(+) T cells) were independent predictors for overall survival. The results also suggested that the systemic impairment of immune system in patients with PDAC, was reversed when primary tumor was removed. Conclusions: The present study provided some evidences that the impairment of host immunity induced by PDAC may play a role in the survival of patients. Copyright (C) 2014, IAP and EPC.

"Despite advances in diagnosis and new treatments such as targeted therapies, breast cancer (BC) is still the most prevalent tumor in women worldwide and the leading cause of death. The principal obstacle for successful BC treatment is the acquired or de novo resistance of the tumors to the systemic therapy (chemotherapy, endocrine, and targeted therapies) that patients receive. In the era of personalized treatment, several studies have focused on the search for biomarkers capable of predicting the response to this therapy; microRNAs (miRNAs) stand out among these markers due to their broad spectrum or potential clinical applications. miRNAs are conserved small non-coding RNAs that act as negative regulators of gene expression playing an important role in several cellular processes, such as cell proliferation, autophagy, genomic stability, and apoptosis. We reviewed recent data that describe the role of miRNAs as potential predictors of response to systemic treatments in BC. Furthermore, upon analyzing the collected published information, we noticed that the overexpression of miR-155, miR-222, miR-125b, and miR-21 predicts the resistance to the most common systemic treatments; nonetheless, the function of these particular miRNAs must be carefully studied and further analyses are still necessary to increase knowledge about their role and future potential clinical uses in BC."
"Sulforaphane is a dietary isothiocyanate found in cruciferous vegetables showing antileukemic activity. With the purpose of extending the potential clinical impact of sulforaphane in the oncological field, we investigated the antileukemic effect of sulforaphane on blasts from patients affected by different types of leukemia and, taking into account the intrinsically hypoxic nature of bone marrow, on a leukemia cell line (REH) maintained in hypoxic conditions. In particular, we tested sulforaphane on patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia, acute myeloid leukemia, T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia, B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia, and blastic NK cell leukemia. Sulforaphane caused a dose-dependent induction of apoptosis in blasts from patients diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic or myeloid leukemia. Moreover, it was able to cause apoptosis and to inhibit proliferation in hypoxic conditions on REH cells. As to its cytotoxic mechanism, we found that sulforaphane creates an oxidative cellular environment that induces DNA damage and Bax and p53 gene activation, which in turn helps trigger apoptosis. On the whole, our results raise hopes that sulforaphane might set the stage for a novel therapeutic principle complementing our growing armature against malignancies and advocate the exploration of sulforaphane in a broader population of leukemic patients."
"Objective To examine if mechanical ventilation with positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) combined with intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) provided a better outcome than IABP alone for the treatment of cardiogenic shock after acute myocardial infarction in patients aged>60 years. Methods This was a retrospective analysis of data from patients in cardiogenic shock, refractory to pharmacological therapy and treated at a geriatric coronary care unit. Results Sixty-two patients were eligible for study inclusion: 33 received IABP alone; 29 received IABP combined with mechanical ventilation. Patients in the IABP+mechanical ventilation group had lower mean arterial blood pressure (BP), systolic BP and partial pressure of oxygen compared with the IABP group, indicating worse cardiac and pulmonary function. In addition, higher rates of pulmonary infection and renal insufficiency were observed in the IABP+mechanical ventilation group than in the IABP group. A statistically significant improvement of left ventricular function before and after treatment was observed in the IABP+mechanical ventilation group, but not in the IABP group. Pulmonary infection and renal insufficiency were risk factors for all-cause in-hospital mortality; successful revascularization was a negative risk factor. There was no between-group difference in survival. Conclusion Mechanical ventilation with an appropriate level of PEEP appears to enhance the beneficial effects of IABP on left ventricular function for patients in cardiogenic shock."
"Elderly or frail patients are often excluded from clinical trials. As a result, clinical outcome of these patients may differ from those obtained in trials. This situation may also hold true for patients who have severe concomitant diseases such as renal, hepatic, or cardiac dysfunction. Being aware of the wide range of clinical situations that a specialist may face is important to ensure that under any circumstances, the patient will receive the best treatment possible. The Spanish Oncology Genitourinary Group issued its first public statement on recommendations for the optimal management of advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC). However, some issues remained unsolved. In this report, we discuss the current role of Medical Oncology in the treatment of patients with advanced RCC and review the management of special patient populations, such as elderly or patients with concomitant diseases."
"To suppress uncertainties caused by parametric variations or disturbances, an adaptive switching gain (ASG) is proposed for integral sliding mode control (ISMC) to regulate speed in permanent magnet synchronous motors (PMSMs). According to system uncertainties, the ASG is designed to adjust the switching gain to suppress the chattering. The adaptive law is a positive value resulting in an increment of the switching gain when the tracking trajectory is outside the boundary layer. Conversely, it is negative with a decrement of the gain. Further, it improves a convergent rate by the function of the reciprocal of the tracking error when the trajectory enters the sliding phase. ISMC with the ASG is applied to a PMSM experiment with the result that this method can effectively suppress high frequency chattering and shows excellent steady state performance of the current loop and speed in a servo system."

"The fluffy porous structure ZnO nanocrystals have been successfully synthesized using citric acid assisted sol-gel method. The ZnO nanocrystals were systematically characterized by XRD, SEM, UVS, and TGA/DSC. Finally, the ZnO nanocrystals were investigated in the photodegradation experiment. The results indicated that the highly photocatalytic activity was exhibited using ZnO nanocrystals as photocatalyst."
"The aim of the present study was to characterize milk production and preweaning development of lambs from Katahdin and Saint Croix sheep. Milk production was measured weekly, from birth to 8 weeks using oxytocin technique, in 12 Katahdin (62.0 +/- 5.0 kg) and 11 Saint Croix (46.2 +/- 4.83 kg) multiparous ewes. The mean daily milk production for the Katahdin ewes was 1.38 +/- 0.54 L/day and for the Saint Croix ewes it was 1.26 +/- 0.49 L/day (P > 0.05) (mean +/- SE for each group). However, more colostrum was produced immediately after parturition by the Katahdin than Saint Croix ewes (P < 0.001). The lamb's weight and weight gain were recorded weekly. The birth weight of lambs from both breeds was similar but at weaning, the Katahdin lambs were heavier (16.46 +/- 0.58 kg) than the Saint Croix lambs (12.90 +/- 0.59 kg) (P < 0.001). Furthermore, a significant positive correlation was found between daily milk yield and daily gain weight in both breeds, but with a greater slope in Katahdin lambs in comparison with Saint Croix lambs. It was concluded that Saint Croix and Katahdin hair sheep breeds produced similar amounts of milk during lactation, but the latter produced heavier lambs at weaning."
"A methodology is presented for the extraction of creep parameters from nanoindentation data - i.e. data obtained from an indentation system with a high resolution displacement measuring capability. The procedure involves consideration of both primary and secondary creep regimes. The sensitivities inherent in the methodology are explored and it is concluded that, provided certain conditions are satisfied, it should be reasonably robust and reliable. In contrast to this, it is also shown that the methodology commonly used at present to obtain (steady state) creep parameters is in general highly unreliable; the effects responsible for this are identified.

"OBJECTIVE: The objective of the study was to investigate whether a history of hydatidiform mole (HM) is associated with an increased risk of adverse outcomes in subsequent pregnancies. STUDY DESIGN: This was a nationwide cohort study with data from population-based registers. The study population consisted of all children registered in the Swedish Medical Birth Register 1973-2009 (n = 3,730,825). Odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated for adverse maternal and offspring pregnancy outcomes by maternal history of HM prior to the delivery, with children to women with no maternal history of HM as the reference. Risk estimates were adjusted for maternal age at delivery and maternal country of birth. RESULTS: A history of HM was not associated with an increased risk of adverse maternal outcomes in subsequent pregnancies (n = 5186). Women exposed to a molar pregnancy prior to the index birth were at an almost 25% increased risk of preterm birth (OR, 1.23; 95% CI, 1.06-1.43), whereas women with at least 1 birth between the HM and the index birth were at an increased risk of a large-for-gestational-age birth and stillbirth (OR, 1.35; 95% CI, 1.10-1.67 and OR, 1.81; 95% CI, 1.11-2.96, respectively). The risk of repeat mole was 0.4%. CONCLUSION: Women with a history of HM are at no increased risk of adverse maternal outcomes in subsequent pregnancies but have an increased risk of large-for-gestational-age birth, stillbirth, and preterm birth. However, in absolute terms, the risk of subsequent adverse offspring outcomes is very low."
"According to recent ""black box"" models of public management, managerial capacity is a critical component for achieving service delivery improvement. In particular, black box models assume that the impact of management systems is maximized through integration with effective leadership. This assumption is tested by analyzing the effects of managerial capacity and organizational leadership on the performance of English local governments, while controlling for a range of other variables, including organizational size, resources, external constraints, and past performance. Empirical results show that capacity possesses a positive statistical association with local government performance and that leadership can enhance the impact of effective management systems."
"Studies have shown that insulin resistance is associated with cognitive impairment. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPAR-gamma) agonists improve insulin sensitivity. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of rosiglitazone, a PPAR-gamma agonist, on cognition in clozapine-treated patients with schizophrenia. In an eight-week double-blind, placebo-controlled pilot trial, clozapine-treated patients with schizophrenia were randomized to receive rosiglitazone (4 mg/day) or placebo. A neuropsychological battery including the Digit Span subtest from the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-III (WAIS-III), the verbal fluency test, the Hopkins Verbal Learning Test (HVLT), the Trail-Making Test (TMT) and the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (WCST) was administered at baseline and week eight. Nineteen patients completed the study. There were no significant differences on any demographic or general clinical variables between the rosiglitazone group (n=9) and the placebo group (n=10). When baseline scores were controlled, there were no significant differences in change scores of cognitive performance over eight weeks between the two groups. In this pilot study, rosiglitazone had no cognitive benefit in clozapine-treated patients with schizophrenia. Future studies with longer treatment duration and larger sample size are needed to further explore the potential role of rosiglitazone in improving cognitive function in patients with schizophrenia.

"Objective: Sport participation shows an overall trend of decline with age (e.g., Statistics Canada, 2013), with the transition into adulthood often threatening athletes' decision to continue in sports (e.g., Lim et al., 2011). This study explored the role of community sport clubs in facilitating sport participation throughout the youth to adult transition among non-elite athletes. Design: This study was part of a larger project, which was guided by a case study design. Method: Eight non-elite athletes (n = 5 males, n = 3 females) that had successfully transitioned from youth to adult community club rugby in Canada's largest city, engaged in semi-structured interviews. Data were analyzed through thematic analysis (Braun & Clarke, 2006). Results: Clubs first played an important role prior to transition, by drawing youth to their clubs. Clubs then built a sense of loyalty, sport commitment, and identity throughout youths' transition into young adulthood; this was fostered by an appealing club philosophy and atmosphere, supportive team mates, and opportunities for senior-junior (adult-youth) mentorship. Clubs' strategies for athletes' continued involvement into adulthood included gradual introduction to the senior (adult) level, a focus on skill development, fitness, and health, flexibility in programming, and providing opportunities for leadership roles. Conclusions: Findings are discussed through the lens of transition/adaptation models, as well as sport participation/development. Findings highlight practical implications for promoting long-term sport participation among non-elite athletes, and emphasize the importance of further research exploring the trajectories of non-elite athletes, as they successfully (or less successfully) transition into adult sport.

"The first two moments and the covariance of the aggregate discounted claims have been found for a stochastic interest rate, from which the inflation rate has been subtracted, and for a claims number process that is an ordinary or a delayed renewal process. Hereafter we extend the preceding results by presenting recursive formulas for the joint moments of this risk process, for a constant interest rate, and non-recursive formulas for higher joint moments when the interest rate is stochastic. Examples are given for exponential claims inter-arrival times and for the Ho-Lee-Merton interest rate model."
"BackgroundThe last 10 years have seen an increase in the number of suicides in the US Armed Forces. Accordingly, the topic of suicides in the German military has received a lot of attention in media and science alike. MethodsThis study retrospectively examined all suicides (N = 107) committed by active, nonretired German military personnel from 2010 to the end of 2014, analyzing archived medical records. In a second step, these data were compared to a representative German Armed Forces survey conducted in 2012 (N = 1,549). ResultsThe following risk groups for suicide were identified: male (OR = 9.6), single (OR = 7.8), aged over 45 years (OR = 4.0), short period of service (<2 years; OR = 2.7), and low level of education (OR = 2.2). Surprisingly, military personnel with little experience in deployments abroad (<2 missions) showed double the risk (OR = 2.0) compared to those who had been deployed more than once. DiscussionMultiple robustness checks show that being single, aged over 45 years, and having obtained a low level of education exhibit the most robust effects on suicide risk. ConclusionEfforts should be made to develop and evaluate risk group-focused prevention programs. We conclude, that further studies should be initiated to show differences of risk groups between lethal and nonlethal suicidal behavior."
"A method for the identification of mechanical parameters based on integral calculation is presented. Both the moment of inertia and the friction constant are identified by the method developed here, which is based on well-known mechanical differential equations. The mechanical system under test is excited according to a pre-determined low-frequency sinusoidal motion, minimizing the distortion, and increasing the accuracy of the results. The parameters are identified using integral calculation, increasing the robustness of the results against measurement noise. Experimental data are supported by simulation, confirming the effectiveness of the proposed technique. The performance improvements shown here are of use in the design of speed and position controllers and observers. Owing to its simplicity, this method can be readily applied to commercial inverter products."
"Tsuji-Trost-type asymmetric allylation of carboxylic acids has been realized by using a cationic CpRu complex with an axially chiral picolinic acid-type ligand (C1-Naph-PyCOOH: naph = naphthyl, py = pyridine). The Carboxylic acid and allylic alcohol intramolecularly condense by the liberation of water Without stoichiometric activation of either nucleophile or electrophile part, thereby attaining high atom- and step-economy, and low E factor. This success can be ascribed to the higher reactivity of allylic alcohols as compared with the allyl ester products in soft Ru/hard Brunstead acid combined catalysis, which can function under slightly acidic conditions unlike the traditional Pd-catalyzed system. Detailed analysis of the stereochemical outcome of the reaction using an enantiomerically enriched D-labeled substrate provides an intriguing view of enantioselection."
"Prostaglandin E-2 (PGE(2)) is one major prostanoid produced under inflammatory situation. Although PGE(2) is known to induce vascular contraction, its detailed mechanism remains unknown. In the present study, we investigated the signaling pathway underlying PGE(2)-induced smooth muscle contraction in rat mesenteric artery. PGE(2) (0.3-30 mu M) concentration-dependently caused contraction in endothelium-denuded artery. RT-PCR showed that this artery expresses mRNAs for all four prostanoid EP receptors (prostanoid EP1-4). Among selective agonists for PGE(2) receptors, only a prostanoid EP3 receptor agonist, ONO-AE-248 (0.3-30 mu M) induced contraction. Consistently, pretreatment with a prostanoid EP3 antagonist (L-798106, 1 mu M) significantly but not completely inhibited the PGE(2)-induced contraction. Interestingly, pretreatment with a prostanoid FP antagonist (AL8810, 1 mu M) or a TP antagonist (SQ29548, 10 nM) also partially inhibited the PGE(2)-induced contraction. Since ONO-AE-248 (10 mu M) did not influence intracellular Ca2+ concentration in mesenteric artery, we next examined the involvement of Ca2+-independent contractile pathway including PKCs and ROCK in prostanoid EP3-mediated contraction. Pretreatment with bisindolyl-maleimide I (a general PKC inhibitor, 1 mu M), Ro-31-8425 (a conventional PKC and PKC epsilon inhibitor, 1 mu M), rottlerin (a selective PKC delta inhibitor, 1 mu M) and Y-27632 (a ROCK inhibitor, 1 mu M) but not Go 6976 (a conventional PKC inhibitor, 1 mu M) attenuated 10 mu M ONO-AE-248-induced vascular contraction. In western blot analysis, we confirmed that the treatment with ONO-AE-248 (10 mu M, 30 min) phosphorylated PKC delta (Thr505) and PKC epsilon (Ser729). These results suggest that PGE(2) induces vascular smooth muscle contraction via prostanoid EP3, FP and TP receptors in rat mesenteric artery. Prostanoid EP3-mediated contraction is ascribed to Ca2+-independent contractile pathway including PKC delta. epsilon and ROCK. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."
"Pediatric deep neck space infections (DNSI) are common in children. If unrecognized, DNSIs can rapidly progress with the potential for developing serious complications. Children fair better than their adult counterparts in the face of complications such as mediastinitis, but early recognition and aggressive management is key to prevent mortality and limit morbidity. Knowledge of the anatomy related to the deep neck spaces helps in anticipating and managing the potential complications. In this article, we review the clinical presentation, complications, and management in pediatric DNSI from the point of view of the pediatric infectious disease physician and the otolaryngologist. We discuss the best management based on current available evidence and the experience of the authors."
"We use AdS/CFT holography to study how a strongly-coupled plasma polarizes when the geometry where it resides is not flat. We compute the linear-response polarization coefficients, which are directly related to the static two-point correlation function of the stress-energy tensor. In the gravitational dual description, these parameters correspond to the tidal deformation coefficients - the Love numbers - of a black brane. We also compute the coefficients of static electric polarization of the plasma."
"In the past decade, ubiquitination has been well documented to have multifaceted roles in regulating NF-kappa B activation in mammals. However, its function, especially how deubiquitinating enzymes balance the NF-kappa B activation, remains largely elusive in invertebrates. Investigating bbtA20 and its binding proteins, bbt A20-binding inhibitor of NF-kappa B (bbtABIN1) and bbtABIN2, in Chinese amphioxus Branchiostoma belcheri tsingtauense, we found that bbtABIN2 can colocalize and compete with bbt TNF receptor-associated factor 6 to connect the K63-linked polyubiquitin chains, whereas bbtABIN1 physically links bbtA20 to bbt NF-kappa B essential modulator (bbtNEMO) to facilitate the K48-linked ubiquitination of bbtNEMO. Similar to human A20, bbtA20 is a dual enzyme that removes the K63-linked polyubiquitin chains and builds the K48-linked polyubiquitin chains on bbt receptor-interacting serine/threonine protein kinase 1b, leading to the inhibition of NF-kappa B signaling. Our study not only suggests that ubiquitination is an ancient strategy in regulating NF-kappa B activation but also provides the first evidence, to our knowledge, for ABINs/A20-mediated inhibition of NF-kappa B via modifying the ubiquitinated proteins in a basal chordate, adding information on the step-wise development of vertebrate innate immune signaling."
"Soft-sediment deformation structures crop out in the Upper Cretaceous carbonate succession in Porto Selvaggio cove in the western Salento peninsula, Apulian foreland, southern Italy. The deformed interval is about 13 m thick and occurs between shallow-water limestones and dolostones formed in peritidal and shallow subtidal environments. It comprises well-bedded grey mudstones interlayered with dark grey laminated microbioclastic wackestones characterized by couplets of closely spaced dark and bright laminae marked by the parallel orientation of calcareous microbioclasts and thin-shelled bivalves. The low biological diversity, scarcity of burrowing biota, anti presence of a well preserved fish fauna provide evidence of anoxic conditions occurring in morphological depressions within the platform, and a stagnant, stratified water body affected by weak bottom currents, indicating the sudden development of a localised and short-lived intraplatform basin. Two soft-sediment deformation horizons (slump sheets) separated by undeformed limestones with similar facies occur in this part of the succession. The lower, thicker slump sheet (1.0-1.3 m thick) contains asymmetric and box folds. Well-developed decollement surfaces (locally containing thick brecciated zones) cut the folds, forming small-scale thrust-sheets and indicating mixed plastic to brittle behaviour. The upper, thinner slump sheet (0.25-0.35 m thick) contains only asymmetric folds, indicating plastic behaviour only. The differences in deformation style are attributed to differences in facies. Measurements of fold-axis orientations in the slump sheets show that they moved in similar directions, recording the development of a local, gently dipping palaeoslope. Autogenic (internal) trigger mechanisms are ruled out by a detailed consideration of facies. The slump sheets were triggered by allogenic, tectonic effects, either the weakening of sediment by seismic activity or the tectonically induced steepening of slopes, or a combination of both. Tectonically induced steepening is consistent with localised and sudden vertical facies changes related to the creation of an intraplatform basin. The occurrence of slump sheets in carbonate platform successions is unusual since carbonate platforms are normally associated with shelves or low-angle ramps. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

"Functional connectomes capture brain interactions via synchronized fluctuations in the functional magnetic resonance imaging signal. If measured during rest, they map the intrinsic functional architecture of the brain. With task-driven experiments they represent integration mechanisms between specialized brain areas. Analyzing their variability across subjects and conditions can reveal markers of brain pathologies and mechanisms underlying cognition. Methods of estimating functional connectomes from the imaging signal have undergone rapid developments and the literature is full of diverse strategies for comparing them. This review aims to clarify links across functional-connectivity methods as well as to expose different steps to perform a group study of functional connectomes. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

"Background As a new bariatric procedure, sleeve gastrectomy with duodenal-jejunal bypass (SGDJB) needs further assessment. We compared the diabetic control between SGDJB and sleeve gastrectomy (SG) in Goto-Kakizaki (GK) rats, a nonobese rat model of type 2 diabetes. Our aim is firstly to develop a nonobese diabetic rat model for SGDJB and secondly to investigate the feasibility and safety of SGDJB to induce diabetes remission. Methods Fifty 11-week-old male GK rats were divided into five groups: sham-operated SG (SOSG), sham-operated SGDJB (SOSGDJB), control, SG, and SGDJB. Rats were observed for 16 weeks after surgery. The body weight, food intake, glycemic control outcomes, ghrelin, peptide YY (PYY), insulin, glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1), and glucose-dependent insulinotropic peptide were measured. Results The operated groups showed lower food intake since 4 weeks postoperation and significant weight loss since 6 weeks postoperation. SGDJB and SG surgeries induced a decreased fasting ghrelin level and increased levels of glucose-stimulated insulin, GLP-1, and PYY secretion at 2 and 16 weeks postoperation. Compared with the SG group, the SGDJB group showed higher glucose-stimulated GLP-1 levels. Both SGDJB and SG groups exhibited significant improvement in oral glucose tolerance and insulin tolerance compared with sham-operated and control groups, but there was no difference between the operated groups. Conclusions This nonobese diabetic rat model may be valuable in studying the effect of SGDJB on diabetic control. SGDJB shows similar improvement of glucose metabolism with SG. Our findings do not provide evidence for the foregut-mediated amelioration in glucose homeostasis."
"Background: Exposure to ambient fine particulate matter (PM2.5) has been associated with a greater risk of non-accidental, cardiovascular and respiratory mortality in Canada. Research based on Canadian cohorts suggests that exposure to PM2.5 varies by demographic and socioeconomic characteristics. Studies of NO2, another pollutant, indicate that persons of lower socioeconomic status and some visible minority groups have greater exposure in urban centres. Data and methods: National residential PM2.5 was estimated from a similar to 1 km(2) spatial layer for respondents to the 2006 Census long-form questionnaire. Weighted PM2.5 estimates from personal-level estimates were determined for white, Aboriginal, visible minority and immigrant populations, as well as for socioeconomic groups (household income, educational attainment) and stratified by urban core, urban fringe and rural residence. Descriptive statistics were provided for selected comparisons. Results: In Canada, PM2.5 exposure was 1.61 mu g/m(3) higher for visible minority (versus white) populations, and 1.55 mu g/m(3) higher for immigrants (versus non-immigrants). When the relatively high percentages of these groups in large cities were taken into account, exposure differences in urban cores were much smaller. Exposure among urban immigrants did not decrease substantially with time since immigration (< 0.5 mu g/m(3) between any two years). In urban cores, residents of low-income households had marginally higher exposure (0.56 mu g/m(3)) than did people who were not in low-income households. Interpretation: Differences between specific population groups in exposure to PM2.5 are due, at least in part, to higher percentages of these groups living in urban cores where air pollution levels are elevated."
"We report on the characterization of planar waveguides in Yb3+-doped silicate glasses fabricated by double-energy proton implantation at a total dose of 3 x 10(16) ions/cm(2). The dark mode spectroscopy and near-field mode profile were evaluated by the prism coupling and end-face coupling methods, respectively. The results indicate that a refractive index enhanced region as well as an optical barrier has been created after the beam process. We propose the ion exchange mechanism between the proton and Na+ ions to illustrate the optical barrier and discuss its influence. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."
"We have synthesized a range of Mo-Nb nitrides at 2.5 GPa and T = 1600 degrees C or 2200 degrees C using high pressure-high temperature techniques. Following syntheses at 1600 degrees C Mo-rich compositions are hexagonal and Nb-rich phases are cubic, with a narrow two-phase region indicating the presence of a solvus. The maximum Mo content in the cubic phase derived from delta-NbN is 40-44 mol%, and the maximum Nb content in the hexagonal delta-MoN phase is 46-47 mol%. There was little variation in the superconducting transition temperature T-c for hexagonal delta-(Mo, Nb) N samples produced in the study. Previous studies showed maximum T-c values of 12-15 K for pure delta-MoN as a function of N-site ordering in high-P, T experiments. Here we recorded T-c 14 K for the limiting Mo-rich composition prepared in the study. We observed T-c = 11.5-16 K for cubic delta-NbN depending on high-P, T synthesis and annealing conditions. This value falls to 5 K for the cubic Mo0.37Nb0.63N0.98 solid solution phase. Some high-P, T synthesis or annealing experiments were carried out at T 2200 degrees C. At this temperature delta-MoN decomposes to produce gamma-MoN0.54. A minor phase in this sample achieves T-c = 9.5 K. A new superconducting hexagonal oxynitride MoN0.74O0.38 with T-c = 16 K was also produced during this study."
"BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the changes of muscle strength in lower limbs and knee valgus alignment using the Prevent Injury and Enhance Performance Program (PEP program) to prevent ACL injuries in female soccer players during an entire season. METHODS: A longitudinal and prospective study was done in twenty female soccer players at the Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico, from a senior team. During 24 weeks the training program was applied three times a week as a part of the team workouts. Video analysis of dynamic knee valgus alignment and maximal strength of quadriceps, hamstrings and gastrocnemius were evaluated pre and post-training. RESULTS: Quadriceps and hamstring strength increased on the right pelvic limb (P<0.001). In addition the quadriceps/hamstrings ratio decreased from 3.38 to 2.3 in the right side, and from 1.99 to 1.09 in the left side. The mechanics of jump improved in 20% of the female soccer players. Muscle strength in quadriceps and hamstrings increased in right pelvic limb (P<0.001), and the quadriceps/hamstrings ratio decreased from 3.38 to 2.3 in right side and from 1.99 to 1.09 in left side. Although injuries did not decrease during this period no ACL injury was registered. CONCLUSIONS: Until now there are no reports about muscle strength and jump technique assessment with the application of the PEP program. The neuromuscular training and muscle balance are important to prevent ACL injuries. We advise that this program is integrated to women's soccer training."
"This paper presents an acoustic-to-articulatory inversion method based on an episodic memory. An episodic memory is an interesting model for two reasons. First, it does not rely on any assumptions about the mapping function but rather it relies on real synchronized acoustic and articulatory data streams. Second, the memory inherently represents the real articulatory dynamics as observed. It is argued that the computational models of episodic memory, as they are usually designed, cannot provide a satisfying solution for the acoustic-to-articulatory inversion problem due to the insufficient quantity of training data. Therefore, an episodic memory is proposed, called generative episodic memory (G-Mem), which is able to produce articulatory trajectories that do not belong to the set of episodes the memory is based on. The generative episodic memory is evaluated using two electromagnetic articulography corpora: one for English and one for French. Comparisons with a codebook-based method and with a classical episodic memory (which is termed concatenative episodic memory) are presented in order to evaluate the proposed generative episodic memory in terms of both its modeling of articulatory dynamics and its generalization capabilities. The results show the effectiveness of the method where an overall root-mean-square error of 1.65mm and a correlation of 0.71 are obtained for the G-Mem method. They are comparable to those of methods recently proposed. (C) 2013 Acoustical Society of America."
"The aim of the study was the formulation of suitable medicinal form for the topical application of Calendula officinalis L. Dry Calendula extract was used as an active compound. This extract was proved to be an effective scavenger of H2O2 radicals in in vitro studies with the mitochondria of rat cardiac muscles. Several compositions of the cream base were evaluated and the hydrophilic cream containing complex emulsifier was chosen as the delivery system. Subsequently, Calendula extract was incorporated, and the concentration of extract which provided significant antioxidant effect (p < 0.05), has been determined. Antioxidant activity of the cream with Calendula extract was due to the content of carotenoids, polyphenols and flavonoids. Cream with the best properties (0.9% of Calendula extract) contained 0.73 +/- 0.04 mg/100 g of total carotenoids expressed as beta-carotene. This cream was then examined microscopically, and stability studies including evaluation of organoleptic properties, microbiologic quality, and determination of variations in total carotenoid content during the storage were made. Achieved results suggest that developed cream with Calendula extract poses the good-quality emulsion system warranting the stability of carotenoids, and thus the therapeutic, namely antioxidant activity of preparation."
"The synergetic effect of the catalytic system cobalt(II) acetate-N-hydroxyphthalimide (NHPI) was studied in acetic acid during the oxidation of alkylbenzenes. The formation of complex between the components of catalytic system NHPI and Co(II) was demonstrated with the use of 1H NMR spectroscopy. It was established that N-hydroxyphthalimide is included in the complex as a ligand substituting for acetic acid in the internal coordination sphere of the metal; the reaction of NHPI with cobalt ions in the internal sphere leads to the formation of phthalimide-N-oxyl radicals that than participate in the catalytic cycle of the oxidation of organic substrates. The stability constants of complexes of NHPI with cobalt acetate were determined, as were those for the outer-sphere complexes of alkylbenzenes with metallocomplex."
"The aim of this paper is to use hybrid electronic tongue in the qualitative and quantitative analysis of extracts obtained from raw and dried apples prepared by different food processing techniques (drying techniques). The system is based on potentiometric and voltammetric sensors, moreover data recorded by spectrophotometry, amperometry and conductometry techniques were applied to enhance the classification ability of the device. The combination of the data from various measurement techniques (hybrid electronic tongue) leads to improved differentiation of the dried apple extracts samples comparing to separate techniques. Appropriate chemometric techniques were used to the recognition and classification of samples, whereas the efficiency of the qualitative and quantitative analysis was evaluated on the basis of Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), determination coefficient (R-2), slope (a), and intercept (b) parameters.

"Pork loins were cooked with 5 different polyphenol-rich vegetable extracts: Polygonum cuspidatum, oregano extract, rosemary extract, white grape extract and green tea extract. These extracts were added to brine, taking into account their solubility, for subsequent injection and cooking. Loins with added vegetable extracts exhibited higher antioxidant effect compared to controls, as shown by the oxidized/reduced ascorbate ratio, the potential of reduction and the fat oxidation rate. However, some effects were observed in terms of taste, colour changes and, in some cases (green tea and oregano), presence of blots on meat slices. Poor diffusion of the brine through the muscle fibres and insolubility of the extracts in localized spots are weaknesses of these products. A significant amount of polyphenols was lost or destroyed during the cooking phase of the process. Sensory tests show that only Polygonum cuspidatum and rosemary extract result in an acceptable product. In this case the contribution of active molecules in the final product is rather limited."
"Intracranial perineural spread (PNS) is a rare complication of cutaneous malignancies and refers to access of the tumor to the intracranial space typically by tracking along cranial nerves. Patients are usually treated with palliative external-beam radiotherapy or with radiosurgery if there has been prior standard radiotherapy. Two patients are presented, both with cranial neuropathies occurring years after treatment for cutaneous malignancies. Radiographic workup showed recurrent tumor involving multiple cranial nerves. Both patients were treated with CyberKnife radiosurgery. To the author's knowledge, these are the first reported patients with intracranial PNS treated via CyberKnife radiosurgery.

"A method to polarize channels universally is introduced. The method is based on combining channels of unequal capacities in each polarization step, as opposed to the standard method of combining identical channels. The locations of the good and bad channels that emerge upon polarization are only a function of the polar transform chosen, and are otherwise independent of the channel being polarized. This yields a simple method to design universal polar codes for discrete memoryless channels. It is also shown that the less noisy ordering of channels is preserved under polarization, and thus, a good polar code for a given channel will perform well over a less noisy one."
"Background Because of an increasing number of boards and conferences, the number of second opinion readings of externally acquired image data is growing dramatically. In this review article we intend to give medical and legal recommendations for the documentation and interpretation of externally acquired radiological data for second opinions and board presentations based on German jurisdiction. Method Using the FAQ format as a dialog between radiologists and medical legal experts, we answer the most crucial questions regarding correct documentation and interpretation for externally acquired radiological image data based on an up-to-date literature search. Results Based on the unity of radiological image data and the corresponding written report according to the radiation protection law, the primary report should be present when composing a second opinion. If the primary external report is not present, this should be mentioned as a limitation. All radiological second opinions should be documented in written form. This is especially important in cases of discrepant findings. Legally, the attending physician is responsible for selecting the radiological opinion. The radiologist should not rely on the written primary report without personal reevaluation. Legally, it would be considered radiological malpractice if the external image data and previous image data are not evaluated personally. Conclusion From a legal point of view, there are explicit recommendations regarding thorough documentation of a second opinion as an independent medical service in all cases."
"Probing catalytic reactions on a catalyst surface in real time is a major challenge. Herein, we demonstrate the utility of a continuous flow millifluidic chip reactor coated with a nanostructured gold catalyst as an effective platform for in situ investigation of the kinetics of catalytic reactions by taking 5-(hydroxymethyl) furfural (HMF) to 2,5-furandicarboxylic acid (FDCA) conversion as a model reaction. The idea conceptualized in this paper can not only dramatically change the ability to probe the time-resolved kinetics of heterogeneous catalysis reactions but also used for investigating other chemical and biological catalytic processes, thereby making this a broad platform for probing reactions as they occur within continuous flow reactors."
"Terrain-following coordinates are widely used in operational models but the cut-cell method has been proposed as an alternative that can more accurately represent atmospheric dynamics over steep orography. Because the type of grid is usually chosen during model implementation, it becomes necessary to use different models to compare the accuracy of different grids. In contrast, here a C-grid finite-volume model enables a like-for-like comparison of terrain-following and cut-cell grids. A series of standard two-dimensional tests using idealized terrain are performed: tracer advection in a prescribed horizontal velocity field, a test starting from resting initial conditions, and orographically induced gravity waves described by nonhydrostatic dynamics. In addition, three new tests are formulated: a more challenging resting atmosphere case, and two new advection tests having a velocity field that is everywhere tangential to the terrain-following coordinate surfaces. These new tests present a challenge on cut-cell grids. The results of the advection tests demonstrate that accuracy depends primarily upon alignment of the flow with the grid rather than grid orthogonality. A resting atmosphere is well maintained on all grids. In the gravity waves test, results on all grids are in good agreement with existing results from the literature, although terrain-following velocity fields lead to errors on cut-cell grids. Because of semi-implicit time stepping and an upwind-biased, explicit advection scheme, there are no time step restrictions associated with small cut cells. In contradiction to other studies, no significant advantages of cut cells or smoothed coordinates are found."
"Eating disorders are a serious, life-threating condition impacting adolescents and young adults. Providers in primary care settings have an important role in identifying disordered eating (DE) symptoms. Unfortunately, symptoms go undetected in 50% of patients in medical settings. Using the behavioral health screen, this study identified DE risk profiles in a sample of 3620 female adolescents and young adults (ages 14-24), presenting in primary care. A latent class analysis with twenty psychosocial factors identified three DE risk groups. The group at highest risk for DE was characterized by endorsement of internalizing symptoms and a history of trauma. The next risk group consisted of those with externalizing symptoms, particularly substance use. The group at lowest risk for DE reported more time spent with friends compared to their peers. Primary care providers and psychiatric teams can benefit from knowing the psychosocial risk patterns affiliated with DE, and using brief, comprehensive screening tools to identify these symptoms."
"Multiple chemical sensitivity (MCS) is characterized by a loss of tolerance to a variety of environmental chemicals. Multiple chemical sensitivity is frequently triggered by exposure to chemical agents, especially insecticides. The aim of the study was to measure the sense of smell and quality of life in patients with MCS compared to the control group. We studied the sense of smell, both sensitive and sensorial characteristics, in female patients with MCS (n = 58, mean 50.5 +/- A 8.5 years) and healthy female volunteers without rhinosinusal pathologies (n = 60, mean age 46 +/- A 10.2 years). Olfactometry (Barcelona Smell Test 24/BAST-24), sinonasal symptoms (visual analogue scale/VAS 0-100 mm), and quality of life (Quick Environmental Exposure and Sensitivity Inventory/QEESI) were assessed. Multiple chemical sensitivity patients showed a significant impairment in smell identification (19 +/- A 12 %; p > 0.05) and forced choice (62 +/- A 18 %; p > 0.05), but not in smell detection (96 +/- A 4 %) compared to the control group. Multiple chemical sensitivity patients reported more odours as being intense and irritating and less fresh and pleasant when compared with the control group. Patients scored a high level (40-100) on QEESI questionnaire (symptom severity, chemical intolerances, other intolerances, life impact). In MCS patients, total symptom intensity (VAS/0-700 mm) score was 202 +/- A 135, while disease severity score was 80 +/- A 23. The most frequent symptoms were itching and posterior rhinorrhea. Multiple chemical sensitivity patients have an impairment in smell cognitive abilities (odour identification and forced choice, but not for detection) with increased smell hypersensitivity and poor quality of life."
"Objectives: To evaluate the outcome of part-time occlusion therapy with or without near activities in monocular amblyopic patients. Methods: prescribed occlusion) One hundred and thirty patients who daily occlusion therapy (part-time were followed-up for a 12-week period. The study was carried out in the Pediatric Ophthalmology and Orthoptics Clinics of King Abdul-Aziz University Hospital, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia for the period from January to November 2010. Sixty-five patients were recommended to undertake the 3 hours of near visual activities (such as reading a book during patching) while the other 65 patients were not advised to do any near activity. Main outcome measures were best corrected visual acuity (VA) for both groups and line improvement. Results: The total line of VA improved from baseline by an average of 6.7 +/- 2.37 line log MAR (logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution) units in the group of patching with near activities and by an average of 5.3 +/- 2.04 line log MAR units in the group of patching without near activities. All type of amblyopia (strabismic, anisometropic, and mixed types of amblyopia) improved significantly after patching with near activities. Both moderate and severe amblyopia improved significantly in the group of near activities compared with the group without near activities. Conclusion: Performing near activities while patching in the treatment of anisometropic, stabismic, or combined amblyopia improves the VA outcome more than patching alone."
"An H-matrices compressed multiplicative Schwarz (MS) preconditioner for the nonconformal finite-element method (FEM-)boundary element method (BEM)-Domain decomposition method (DDM) is proposed to analyze the electromagnetic radiation and scattering from periodic structures such as frequency-selective surfaces (FSSs) or antenna arrays. To improve the overall convergence, an MS preconditioner is proposed for the DDM matrix. The hierarchical matrix (H-matrices) technique is introduced into the preconditioned system to compress the dense matrices to further improve the efficiency. Moreover, a finite-element tearing and interconnecting like algorithm is adopted to eliminate the interior volumetric FEM unknowns and the multilevel fast multipole algorithm is integrated to reduce the computational complexity of BEM. Numerical examples are presented to validate the proposed method. It is observed that this method exhibits superior performance and consumes far less memory and CPU time than the traditional implementation."
"While the medical ethics literature has well explored the harm to patients, families, and the integrity of the profession in failing to disclose medical errors once they occur, less often addressed are the moral and professional obligations to take all available steps to prevent errors and harm in the first instance. As an expanding body of scholarship further elucidates the causes of medical error, including the considerable extent to which medical errors, particularly in diagnostics, may be attributable to cognitive sources, insufficient progress in systematically evaluating and implementing suggested strategies for improving critical thinking skills and medical judgment is of mounting concern. Continued failure to address pervasive thinking errors in medical decisionmaking imperils patient safety and professionalism, as well as beneficence and nonmaleficence, fairness and justice. We maintain that self-reflective and metacognitive refinement of critical thinking should not be construed as optional but rather should be considered an integral part of medical education, a codified tenet of professionalism, and by extension, a moral and professional duty."
"1. The c/c alleles are responsible for the white plumage colour of ducks; however, the gene corresponding to this locus is still unclear. In order to identify the locus-related candidate gene associated with duck's plumage colour pattern, it was necessary to analyse the whole genome resequencing data. 2. A total of 929,465 SNPs in chromosome 13 and 1,688 SNPs in the region of the Microphthalmia-Associated Transcription Factor (MITF) gene were identified from whole genome resequencing data analysis. After construction of an F-ST plot from chromosome 13, MITF was highlighted as a candidate gene, possessing the highest F-ST value (0.811) on chromosome 13. 3. Six novel SNPs were discovered, located in the intronic region of the MITF gene. F2 progeny of Kaiya x Liancheng ducks (N = 1,061) were selected for genotyping by the Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism (RFLP) technique. Association analysis using Haploview software was used for validation of the results. 4. Association results between SNPs and phenotypes showed significant association with corresponding phenotypes. All the significantly associated SNPs were located in the identified candidate gene. 5. The identified candidate gene provided novel information which is important in marker-assisted selection and breeding of duck and for the investigation of the C locus recessive white genetic mechanisms underlying plumage colour pattern."
"Capsular polysaccharides (CP) of serotypes 5 (CP5) and 8 (CP8) are major Staphylococcus aureus virulence factors. Previous studies have shown that salicylic acid (SAL), the main aspirin metabolite, affects the expression of certain bacterial virulence factors. In the present study, we found that S. aureus strain Reynolds (CP5) cultured with SAL was internalized by MAC-T cells in larger numbers than strain Reynolds organisms not exposed to SAL. Furthermore, the internalization of the isogenic nonencapsulated Reynolds strain into MAC-T cells was not significantly affected by preexposure to SAL. Pretreatment of S. aureus strain Newman with SAL also enhanced internalization into MAC-T cells compared with that of untreated control strains. Using strain Newman organisms, we evaluated the activity of the major cap5 promoter, which was significantly decreased upon preexposure to SAL. Diminished transcription of mgrA and upregulation of the saeRS transcript, both global regulators of CP expression, were found in S. aureus cultured in the presence of SAL, as ascertained by real-time PCR analysis. In addition, CP5 production by S. aureus Newman was also decreased by treatment with SAL. Collectively, our data demonstrate that exposure of encapsulated S. aureus strains to low concentrations of SAL reduced CP production, thus unmasking surface adhesins and leading to an increased capacity of staphylococci to invade epithelial cells. The high capacity of internalization of the encapsulated S. aureus strains induced by SAL pretreatment may contribute to the persistence of bacteria in certain hosts."
"Transferability of sequence-tagged-sites (STS) markers was assessed for genetic relationships study among accessions of marvel grass (Dichanthium annulatum Forsk.). In total, 17 STS primers of Stylosanthes origin were tested for their reactivity with thirty accessions of Dichanthium annulatum. Of these, 14(82.4%) reacted and a total 106 (84 polymorphic) bands were scored. The number of bands generated by individual primer pairs ranged from 4 to 11 with an average of 7.57 bands, whereas polymorphic bands ranged from 4 to 9 with an average of 6.0 bands accounts to an average polymorphism of 80.1%. Polymorphic information content (PIC) ranged from 0.222 to 0.499 and marker index (MI) from 1.33 to 4.49. Utilizing Dice coefficient of genetic similarity dendrogram was generated through un-weighted pair group method with adthmetic mean (UPGMA) algorithm. Further, clustering through sequential agglomerative hierarchical and nested (SAHN) method resulted three main clusters constituted all accessions except IGBANG-D-2. Though there was intermixing of few accessions of one agro-climatic region to another, largely groupings of accessions were with their regions of collections. Bootstrap analysis at 1000 scale also showed large number of nodes (11 to 17) having strong clustering (>50). Thus, results demonstrate the utility of STS markers of Stylosanthes in studying the genetic relationships among accessions of Dichanthium."
"Contact glow discharge electrolysis (CGDE) also termed plasma electrolysis is a novel electrolysis where a stable sheath of light emitting plasma develops around an electrode immersed well inside a relatively high-conductivity liquid electrolyte during normal electrolysis (NE) at several hundred volts. The phenomenon may develop in dc-, pulsed dc-, ac- as well as RF-driven electrolyses. The chemical effects of CGDE are remarkably non-faradaic in respect to the nature of the products as well as their yields. The article traces comprehensively the progress made in studies of CGDE in aqueous and non-aqueous solutions since 1844 and reviews the developments in the understanding of its origin, light emission, plasma state and non-faradaic effects leading to the elucidation of detailed mechanism of the origin of CGDE on the basis of the onset of hydrodynamic instabilities in local vaporization of the solvent near the working electrode during NE, and that of highly non-faradaic effects of CGDE based on a model of two reaction zones located within the electrode plasma and at the plasma-liquid interface producing solvent derived radicals at high local concentrations. Keeping in view the recent surge of interest in varied applications of CGDE, the article is appended with highlights of these applications across synthetic chemistry, waste water treatment, electrosurgical devices, nanoparticle fabrications, surface engineering and micro-machining."
"Background: Grass carp reovirus (GCRV) is responsible for viral hemorrhagic disease in cultured grass carp (Ctenopharyngon idellus). GCRV is a non-enveloped, double-stranded RNA virus in the genus Aquareovirus, of the family Reoviridae, which encodes seven structural proteins (VP1-VP7) and five nonstructural proteins (NS80, NS38, NS31, NS26, and NS16). To date, the mechanism of GCRV entry into CIK Ctenopharyngon idellus kidney (CIK) cells remains poorly understood. Results: Here, we present a study of the GCRV internalization mechanism in CIK cells. Our results indicated that GCRV infection was inhibited by chlorpromazine, the specific inhibitor for clathrin-mediated endocytosis. Colocalization of GCRV virions with endogenous clathrin was observed during early infection by confocal microscopy. Moreover, GCRV infection of CIK cells depended on acidification of the endosome. This was indicated by significant inhibition of viral infection following prophylactic treatment with the lysosomotropic drugs chloroquine or ammonium chloride. In addition, the disturbance of dynamin activity blocked GCRV entry, which confirmed the dynamin-dependent nature of clathrin-mediated endocytosis. Conclusion: Our findings suggest that GCRV might enter CIK cells via clathrin-mediated endocytosis in a pH-dependent manner. Additionally, dynamin is critical for efficient viral entry."
"Chitin, a structural polysaccharide of beta-1,4-linked N-acetyl-D-glucosamine residues, is the second most abundant natural biopolymer after cellulose. The metabolism of chitin affects the global carbon and nitrogen cycles, which are maintained by marine and soil-dwelling bacteria. The degradation products of chitin metabolism serve as important nutrient sources for the chitinolytic bacteria. Chitinolytic bacteria have elaborate enzymatic systems for the degradation of the recalcitrant chitin biopolymer. This chapter introduces chitin degradation and utilization systems of the chitinolytic bacteria. These bacteria secrete many chitin-degrading enzymes, including processive chitinases, endo-acting non-processive chitinases, lytic polysaccharide monooxygenases, and N-acetyl-hexosaminidases. Bacterial chitinases play a fundamental role in the degradation of chitin. Enzymatic properties, catalytic mechanisms, and three-dimensional structures of chitinases have been extensively studied by many scientists. These enzymes can be exploited to produce a range of chitin-derived products, e.g., biocontrol agents against many plant pathogenic fungi and insects. We introduce bacterial chitinases in terms of their reaction modes and structural features."
"This study incorporates the 5E learning cycle strategy to design and develop Sharable Content Object Reference Model-conformant materials for elementary science education. The 5E learning cycle that supports the constructivist approach has been widely applied in science education. The strategy consists of five phases: engagement, exploration, explanation, elaboration and evaluation. It has potential value for creating effective science e-learning materials. This study implemented the participatory design (PD) method to investigate the possibility of applying the 5E model to science e-learning materials. PD is an approach that understands knowledge by doing and focuses on collaborating with the intended users rather than designing 'for' them. In this study, researchers, designers and elementary science teachers cooperated at all stages of the design process (including explanation, analysis and decision making). The issues to be dealt with in this study included instructional designs based on the 5E model, techniques or specifications of e-learning, learning objects, metadata and procedures. The results of this study provided concrete recommendations for how to incorporate the 5E learning cycle and how to develop effective e-learning materials for elementary science instruction."
"Objective-To determine pharmacokinetics, efficacy, and adverse effects of topically administered selamectin in flea-infested rabbits. Animals-18 healthy 5-month-old New Zealand White rabbits. Procedures-On day 0, rabbits (n = 6/group) received topically applied selamectin at doses of 10 or 20 mg/kg or received no treatment. Each rabbit was infested with 50 fleas (Ctenocephalides felis) on days -1, 7, and 14. Live and dead flea counts were performed on days 2, 9, and 16, and treatment efficacy was calculated. Blood samples were collected prior to drug administration and at 6 and 12 hours and 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 10, 14, 21, and 28 days after treatment for determination of plasma selamectin concentrations via high-performance liquid chromatography with mass spectrometry. Pharmacokinetic parameters were determined. Results-On day 2, efficacy of selamectin against flea populations of rabbits in the 10 and 20 mg/kg treatment groups was 91.3% and 97.1%, respectively, but by day 9, these values decreased to 37.7% and 74.2%, respectively. Mean terminal half-life and maximum plasma concentrations of selamectin were 0.93 days and 91.7 ng/mL, respectively, for rabbits in the 10 mg/kg group and 0.97 days and 304.2 ng/mL, respectively, for rabbits in the 20 mg/kg group. No adverse effects were detected. Conclusions and Clinical Relevance-Selamectin was rapidly absorbed transdermally and was rapidly eliminated in rabbits. Results suggested that topical administration at a dosage of 20 mg/kg every 7 days is efficacious for treatment of flea infestation in rabbits. Further studies are needed to assess long-term safety in rabbits following repeated applications. (Am J Vet Res 2012;73:562-566)"
"A species known from earlier behavioural studies as ""Holoplatys sp."", is described as Trite pollardi sp. nov. Within the genus Trite, two species groups are distinguished: the Plahiceps-group (found in New Caledonia, New Zealand, Lord Howe Island and Norfolk Island) and the incognita-group (limited to New Zealand). The three alternative scenarios of the Trite origin, relationships and radiation in New Zealand, New Caledonia and Lord Howe Island are discussed. Three species are considered to be excluded from Trite."
"A series of Mg-Al-Ce mixed oxides with (nMg(2+))/(nCe(3+) + nAl(13)+) = 5 and nCe(3+)/(nCe(3+) + nAl(3+)) = 0 similar to 7% were synthesized by co-precipitation method based on a hydrotalcite route and used as support to prepare Co-Mo sulfur-resistant water-gas shift (WGS) catalysts. The supports and catalysts were characterized by XRD, ICP, N-2- physisorption; CO2-TPD, H-2-TPR, H2S-TPS, TEM, and CO-IR. It is found that the catalytic performance and physicochemical property of the Co-Mo/Mg(AI)O catalyst are significantly influenced by the Ce modification. The addition of Ce effectively enhances the WGS activity and the highest activity is obtained on the Co-Mo/Mg (Al)O-CeO2 (5%) catalyst, where the activity at 623 K increases about 2.5 times. The results of H2S-TPS investigation show that in the presence of Ce, the H2S consumption peak shifts to lower temperatures and there is decrease of Mo sulfidation activation energy. Furthermore, HRTEM analysis shows that the addition of Ce (5%) results in decrease of MoS2 slab length and stacking number, and those of CO-IR characterization indicate increased exposure of surface MoS2 sites. It is suggested that the addition of Ce promotes the formation of MoS2 slabs that are smaller in size, leading to higher exposure of surface active sites and hence higher activity."
"This paper describes a high performance voltage differencing inverting buffered amplifier (VDIBA). The transconductance of the proposed circuit is enhanced by using positive feedback technique with only two extra transistors used in active load. Moreover, the bandwidth of proposed circuit is enhanced by using resistive compensation technique. The performance of proposed VDIBA is demonstrated by detailed frequency analysis. Furthermore, it is shown that the transconductance can be enhanced up to 4.61 mS at biasing current of 300 A mu A. In addition, a third order low pass filter is given as an application example to confirm the high performance of the proposed VDIBA. The proposed low pass filter operates at natural pole frequency of 15 MHz. The proposed VDIBA and its filter application are implemented using TSMC 90 nm CMOS technology in Cadence virtuoso schematic composer at +/- 0.6 V supply voltage."
"Background: Although the incidence of pediatric patients in emergency services is as low as 5-10%, trauma remains one of the leading causes of death during childhood. Only a few reports exist about the quality of the initial treatment of pediatric trauma patients. Therefore, we tested the hypothesis of whether pre-hospital treatment and emergency management in pediatric trauma patients is similar to the treatment that is provided for adult patients. Materials and Methods: We performed a retrospective data analysis of the German Trauma Registry of the DGU from January 1993 to December 2007. Exclusion criteria were missing information about injury severity and/or age and patients older than 50 years. All pediatric patients were subdivided into five groups (infants 0-1 year, toddlers 2-5 years, children 6-9 years, pupils 10-13 years, teenagers 14-17 years) with regard to their age and were compared with the adult cohort (18-50 years). From 24,396 patients, 2,961 were below 18 years of age, thus, about 12% of the whole population of injured patients below the age of 50 years. Results: 66.4% of infants sustained relevant head injuries (Abbreviated Injury Scale [AIS] >= 3), and this rate declined with increasing age. The mean Injury Severity Score (ISS) increased from 21.0 (+/-11.6) in the group of infants to 26.7 (+/-13.9) in the adult cohort. In all groups, the majority of patients were male. The injury pattern differed according to age, with predominant traumatic brain injury (TBI) in infants. During the preclinical treatment, infants were less often intubated and this was contrasted by a higher rate of cardiopulmonary resuscitation in this group (infants 16.2%, toddlers 6.8%, adults 3.1%). Diagnostic multislice computed tomography (CT) examination was less often performed in infants as compared to the other groups (infants 57.1%, toddlers 77.2%, adults 77.8%). Mortality and quality indicators such as timelines show no significant differences between children and adults. Conclusion: We observed typical age-dependent differences regarding the injury pattern and severity and differences referring to the preclinical and initial treatment. With respect to the high rate of serious TBI in the infants and toddlers age groups, a more focused education and training of emergency physicians and paramedics should be considered."
"Post-harvest management constraints are economically significant in Africa for a broad range of commodities, resulting in a substantial negative impact on food security and livelihoods. Rhyzopertha dominica (Fabricius) (Coleoptera: Bostrichidae) coexists with Sitophilus oryzae (L.) (Coleoptera: Dryophthoridae) - they infest stored cereal grains, especially in sub-Saharan Africa, and cause significant losses in storage. Laboratory studies were carried out to determine the efficacy of Xylocoris flavipes (Reuter) (Hemiptera: Anthocoridae) and Theocolax elegans (Westwood) (Hymenoptera: Pteromalidae), alone or in combination, in suppressing populations of R. dominica and S. oryzae in stored rice and wheat grains. The weight loss and moisture of the infested grains were assessed, for the various combinations of the two pest insects and the two natural enemies. In rice there was a synergistic effect of the combined release of T. elegans and X. flavipes against both R. dominica and S. oryzae compared to the effect of one natural enemy alone. With the combined release, only 2% F-1 progeny of the pest beetles emerged compared to the untreated control (100%), whereas 3.5 and 6% emerged when X. flavipes and T. elegans, respectively, were released alone. When the two natural enemies were released in combination, 0.4% R. dominica F-1 progeny emerged, compared to 1.6% with X. flavipes or T. elegans alone. In the combined release only 0.3% S. oryzae F-1 progeny emerged, whereas 65% emerged with X. flavipes alone and 41% with T. elegans alone. No synergistic effect of the combined release of the two natural enemies was detected in wheat. In stored rice, the lowest percentage of weight loss (44%) was found when both natural enemies and both beetle species were present. We conclude that the combination of the predator and the parasitoid should be recommended when R. domininca and S. oryzae coexist and feed on stored cereals, especially rice."
"In recent years, there has been increasing concern over the possibility of a radiological or nuclear incident occurring somewhere in the world. Intelligence agencies frequently report that terrorist groups and rogue nations are seeking to obtain radiological or nuclear weapons of mass destruction. In addition, there exists the real possibility that safety of nuclear power reactors could be compromised by natural (such as the tsunami and subsequent Fukushima accident in Japan in March, 2011) or accidental (Three Mile Island, 1979 and Chernobyl, 1986) events. Although progress has been made by governments around the world to prepare for these events, including the stockpiling of radiation countermeasures, there are still challenges concerning care of patients injured during a radiation incident. Because the deleterious and pathological effects of radiation are so broad, it is desirable to identify medical countermeasures that can have a beneficial impact on several tissues and organ systems. Cellular therapies have the potential to impact recovery and tissue/organ regeneration for both early and late complications of radiation exposure. These therapies, which could include stem or blood progenitor cells, mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) or cells derived from other tissues (e.g., endothelium or placenta), have shown great promise in treating other nonradiation injuries to and diseases of the bone marrow, skin, gastrointestinal tract, brain, lung and heart. To explore the potential use of these therapies in the treatment of victims after acute radiation exposure, the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases co-sponsored an international workshop in July, 2015 in Paris, France with the Institut de Radioprotection et de Surete Nucleaire. The workshop included discussions of data available from testing in preclinical models of radiation injury to different organs, logistics associated with the practical use of cellular therapies for a mass casualty incident, as well as international regulatory requirements for authorizing such drug products to be legally and readily used in such incidents. This report reviews the data presented, as well as key discussion points from the meeting. (C) 2017 by Radiation Research Society"
"OBJECTIVES: Randomized trials demonstrated that chromoendoscopy is superior to white light endoscopy with random biopsy sampling (WLE) for the detection of dysplasia in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Whether implementing chromoendoscopy can increase the detection of dysplasia in clinical practice is unknown. METHODS: Patients with ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD) undergoing colonoscopic surveillance between January 2000 and November 2013 in three referral centers were identified using the patients' medical records. In recent years, the use of high-definition chromoendoscopy was adopted in all three centers using segmental pancolonic spraying of 0.1% methylene blue or 0.3% indigo carmine (chromoendoscopy group). Previously, surveillance was performed employing WLE with random biopsies every 10 cm (WLE group). The percentage of colonoscopies with dysplasia was compared between both groups. RESULTS: A total of 440 colonoscopies in 401 patients were performed using chromoendoscopy and 1,802 colonoscopies in 772 patients using WLE. Except for a higher number of CD patients with extensive disease and more patients with a first-degree relative with colorectal cancer (CRC) in the chromoendoscopy group, the known risk factors for IBD-associated CRC were comparable between both groups. Dysplasia was detected during 48 surveillance procedures (11%) in the chromoendoscopy group as compared with 189 procedures (10%) in the WLE group (P = 0.80). Targeted biopsies yielded 59 dysplastic lesions in the chromoendoscopy group, comparable to the 211 dysplastic lesions detected in the WLE group (P = 0.30). CONCLUSIONS: Despite compelling evidence from randomized trials, implementation of chromoendoscopy for IBD surveillance did not increase dysplasia detection compared with WLE with targeted and random biopsies."
"We synthesized Ni nanoparticles with an atmospheric-thermal chemical vapor deposition method and investigated their lattice distortions and defects using Bragg coherent diffractive imaging. Because the strain can alter the magnetic properties of ferromagnetic materials, it is important to study the lattice distortion and structural imperfection. As a result of the Bragg coherent diffractive imaging, we found that the Ni nanocubes have a deformation-free zone in the middle. In addition, the defects such as dislocation and twin domain defects were detected in other Ni nanoparticles based on the Bragg diffraction images and patterns. The imaging of nanoparticles can contribute to a better understanding of their growth mechanisms and improve the design and synthesis of nanoparticles. Published by AIP Publishing."
"Purpose: To examine the validity of 2 kinematic systems for assessing mean velocity (MV), peak velocity (PV), mean force (MF), peak force (PF), mean power (MP), and peak power (PP) during the full-depth free-weight back squat performed with maximal concentric effort. Methods: Ten strength-trained men (26.1 +/- 3.0 y, 1.81 +/- 0.07 m, 82.0 +/- 10.6 kg) performed three 1-repetition-maximum (1RM) trials on 3 separate days, encompassing lifts performed at 6 relative intensities including 20%, 40%, 60%, 80%, 90%, and 100% of 1RM. Each repetition was simultaneously recorded by a PUSH band and commercial linear position transducer (LPT) (GymAware [GYM]) and compared with measurements collected by a laboratory-based testing device consisting of 4 LPTs and a force plate. Results: Trials 2 and 3 were used for validity analyses. Combining all 120 repetitions indicated that the GYM was highly valid for assessing all criterion variables while the PUSH was only highly valid for estimations of PF (r = .94, CV = 5.4%, ES = 0.28, SEE = 135.5 N). At each relative intensity, the GYM was highly valid for assessing all criterion variables except for PP at 20% (ES = 0.81) and 40% (ES = 0.67) of 1RM. Moreover, the PUSH was only able to accurately estimate PF across all relative intensities (r = .92-.98, CV = 4.0-8.3%, ES = 0.04-0.26, SEE = 79.8-213.1 N). Conclusions: PUSH accuracy for determining MV, PV, MF, MP, and PP across all 6 relative intensities was questionable for the back squat, yet the GYM was highly valid at assessing all criterion variables, with some caution given to estimations of MP and PP performed at lighter loads."
"According to the two types of slab defects (surface crack and internal crack), a real-time slab quality diagnosis and analysis system named CISDI_SQDS ONLINE R2011 was developed based on heat transfer and solidification simulation, stress and strain calculation as well as metallurgical process analysis about continuous casting, combined with expert knowledge database for specific casting events. The respective crack formation indexes were introduced as the theoretical reference data for slab quality level evaluation. Meanwhile, both the quality loss factors related to casting metallurgical rules and the adjusting factors related to casting events were taken into full consideration, which was integrated organically with theoretical analysis and expert system. The system can be widely used as an important theoretical tool for prediction and control of slab quality in slab continuous casting process."
"In this article, we describe the most extensive set of word associations collected to date. The database contains over 12,000 cue words for which more than 70,000 participants generated three responses in a multiple-response free association task. The goal of this study was (1) to create a semantic network that covers a large part of the human lexicon, (2) to investigate the implications of a multiple-response procedure by deriving a weighted directed network, and (3) to show how measures of centrality and relatedness derived from this network predict both lexical access in a lexical decision task and semantic relatedness in similarity judgment tasks. First, our results show that the multiple-response procedure results in a more heterogeneous set of responses, which lead to better predictions of lexical access and semantic relatedness than do single-response procedures. Second, the directed nature of the network leads to a decomposition of centrality that primarily depends on the number of incoming links or in-degree of each node, rather than its set size or number of outgoing links. Both studies indicate that adequate representation formats and sufficiently rich data derived from word associations represent a valuable type of information in both lexical and semantic processing."
"Ni-P\alginate microgels coatings, as potential metallic protective coatings with self-healing properties, were deposited by the electroless method. The alginate microgels contained nickel chloride and sodium hypophosphite. It was proven that the reduction of nickel ions released from the microgels is possible on the steel and Ni-P coating surface. The self-healing effect of this system was studied by X-ray fluorescence (XRF), chronoamperometry and scanning vibrating electrode technique (SVET). An improved corrosion protection observed here is attributed to the reduction of nickel ions to metallic nickel on the tested surfaces. Differences in the surface concentration of nickel and phosphorous species in the corrosion tested coatings with and without microgels, as evaluated using X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS), provided substantial evidence for the formation of a Ni-P coating from the compounds included in the microgels.

Angiotensin-(1-7) is an important active component in the renin-angiotensin-system. Due to its cardio protective effects it is now under investigation in combination with antioxidants as a reperfusion solution. The combination showed impressive effects on isolated hearts of male Wistar rats after induced ischemia. In this work a high performance liquid chromatography method with fluorescence detection was developed for the first time for in-process measurements as well as for stability tests of the peptide in the novel antioxidant-containing KaralA (R) solution. For fluorescence detection of angiotensin-(1-7) fluorescamine as derivatization dye was applied. Under optimized conditions the method showed linearity over the range of 50 to 5000 ng/mL with R-2 of 0.9988 and an overall precision better than 5.0 %. LOD and LOQ were determined to be in the femtomol range on column. It was found that stability of angiotensin-(1-7) could be significantly improved in the antioxidant containing preparation compared to aqueous solutions.
"The properties and the antioxidant activity of a series of hydroxytyrosyl esters having different carbon chain lengths (C4, C8, C12 and C18) have been measured in phosphatidylcholine model membrane (liposomes) using specific probes for the bilayer and liposome lumen microenvironment, i.e., 1,6-diphenyl-1,3,5-hexatriene (DPH) and 2',7'-dichlorodihydrofluorescein (H2DCF), respectively. Antioxidants self-assembly and their interaction with liposomes has been evaluated by light scattering, fluorescence, turbidimetry, gel filtration chromatography and microfiltration measurements, allowing the determination of critical aggregation concentration, bound fraction, capacity of crossing the lipid bilayer. The distribution of hydroxytyrosyl long chain esters has been proved to depend quite specifically on their lipophilic chain length, and this turns to have deep effects on their antioxidant behaviour. Shedding new light on the cut off effect and antioxidant behaviour of phenolipids, this study also put forward the relevance of cell-free liposome-based cellular models, like giant liposomes, for further characterization of analogous systems."
"Context: Euterpe oleracea Mart. (Arecaceae) fruits and their dietary supplements are gaining much popularity internationally. Anthocyanins and their aglycons are responsible for the dense color of a a fruit and are associated with a wide spectrum of health promoting effects. Objective: Quantitative analysis of anthocyanins in a a dietary supplement raw materials; processed a a powder (ADSR-1), organic a a powder (ADSR-2), and nonorganic a a powder (ADSR-3) by quadrupole-time-of-flight liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry (Q-TOF LC/MS) have been reported in this study. Materials and methods: The chromatographic separation for anthocyanins was achieved using a C-18 column with a gradient of 0.1% formic acid in water and 0.1% formic acid in methanol and acetonitrile (50: 50, v/v). MS and MS/MS experiments were carried out on an electrospray ionization-Q-TOF LC/MS. Results: Except for ASDR-2, all the a a samples were found to have cyanidin 3-glucoside (1), cyanidin 3-sambubioside (2), cyanidin 3-rutinoside (3), and peonidin 3-rutinoside (4). ASDR-2 contained anthocyanins 1 and 3. Among the a a samples quantified, ADSR-3 showed higher concentration of anthocyanins compared to other raw materials and capsules tested in this study. Discussion and conclusion: The anthocyanins 1-4 present in ADSR-3 were 27.13 +/- 0.37, 1.76 +/- 0.04, 31.07 +/- 0.49, and 3.46 +/- 0.08 mg/100 g dry wt, respectively. The LOQ values for anthocyanins 1-4 were in the range of 2.44-9.76 ng/mL. Accuracy of the method was assessed by performing a recovery experiments. The intraday and interday variations (RSDs) were <10%. This is the first report on quantitation of anthocyanins in a a dietary supplement raw materials and capsules."

"BACKGROUND & AIMS A significant proportion of patients with hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection discontinue anti viral treatment prematurely Risk factors for discontinuation before 48 weeks among patients with genotype 1 HCV vary over the course of therapy We investigated the rates and risk factors for treatment discontinuation within 12 weeks, 12-24 weeks, and 24-48 weeks METHODS We retrospectively evaluated data from all Veterans Affairs (VA) patients with genotype 1 HCV who initiated pegylated interferon and ribavirin therapy from 2002-2007 (n = 11,019) We accounted for appropriate discontinuation because of viral nonresponse RESULTS Overall, 53% of patients completed at least 38 4 weeks of therapy (80% of the projected 48 weeks), 16 5% discontinued early in the setting of viral nonresponse, and 30 9% discontinued de spite viral response or in the absence of virologic data Cirrhosis, diabetes, pretreatment substance use disorder, hemoglobin, and lack of hematopoietic growth factor use independently predicted discontinuation before 12 weeks (P < 05 for all) Among patients with documented early virologic responses, higher baseline levels of creatinine, depression, and lack of growth factor use predicted discontinuation from 12-24 weeks No factors independently predicted discontinuation from 24-48 weeks among patients responding to treatment at 24 weeks CONCLUSIONS Early discontinuation of antiviral therapy is common Use of growth factors was the strongest independent predictor of treatment retention be fore 24 weeks and should be evaluated prospectively Early interventions may also be warranted for other risk factors for early discontinuation, such as pre-existing substance use, depression, cirrhosis, or diabetes"
"Nanocrystalline merwinite was successfully synthesized by mechanical activation of a mixture of magnesium hydroxide, calcium oxide and silica gel powders followed by heat treatment. The phase development and various physical properties were investigated as a function of milling time using X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, simultaneous thermal analysis, particle size analysis and transmission electron microscopy. The results showed that formation of merwinite in annealed powders was enhanced by increasing the milling time. Nanocrystalline merwinite powder with an average crystallite size of about 36 nm was obtained after 30 hours of ball milling and subsequent annealing in 900 degrees C for 1 hour."
"How should we understand the claim that people comply with social norms because they possess the right kinds of beliefs and preferences? I answer this question by considering two approaches to what it is to believe (and prefer), namely: representationalism and dispositionalism. I argue for a variety of representationalism, viz. neural representationalism. Neural representationalism is the conjunction of two claims. First, what it is essential to have beliefs and preferences is to have certain neural representations. Second, neural representations are often necessary to adequately explain behaviour. After having canvassed one promising way to understand what neural representations could be, I argue that the appeal to beliefs and preferences in explanations of paradigmatic cases of norm compliance should be understood as an appeal to neural representations."
"Background: Pancreatic insufficient cystic fibrosis (CF) patients receive vitamin A supplementation according to CF-specific recommendations to prevent deficiencies. Whether current recommendations are optimal for preventing both deficiency and toxicity is a subject of debate. We assessed the longitudinal relation between serum retinol levels and appropriate variables. Methods: We studied vitamin A intake, and the long-term effects of vitamin A intake, coefficient of fat absorption (CFA) and immunoglobulin G (IgG) on serum retinol levels in 221 paediatrics CF patients during a seven-year follow up period. Results: Total Vitamin A intake, derived from 862 dietary assessments, exceeded the tolerable upper intake level in 30% of the assessments, mainly up to age six. Although CF patients failed to meet the CF specific recommendations, serum retinol deficiency was found in only 17/862 (2%) of the measurements. Longitudinally, we observed no association to serum retinol levels for total vitamin A intake, CFA, gender or age but serum retinol levels were associated with serum IgG levels. Each g/L increase in serum IgG level would result in a 2.49% (95% CI -3.60 to -1.36%) reduction in serum retinol levels. Conclusion: In this large sample of children and adolescents with CF, serum retinol deficiency was rare despite lower than the CF-specific recommendations. However, the TUL was commonly exceeded. A reduction in CF-specific vitamin A supplementation recommendations should therefore be considered. Moreover, serum retinol levels were not associated with vitamin A intake, CFA, gender or age, although a decreased serum retinol was associated with an increased serum IgG.

"In this study, a bulk crystalline glass forming alloy with the composition of Al87.4Co7.9Ce4.7 (at.%) was rapidly solidified by large area electron beam (LAEB) surface melting of an as-cast starting material. Glancing angle XRD results show that, providing appropriate processing parameters are selected, a predominantly amorphous layer similar to 5 mu m thick can be produced. However, under non-optimum processing conditions treated layers are compositionally inhomogeneous and comprise, in the main, crystalline regions. LAEB treated layers also exhibit a degree of surface cracking as well as micron-sized localised craters and ejected particles formed during electron beam irradiation. Potentiodynamic polarisation tests show that treated layers exhibit enhanced corrosion resistance compared to the as-cast bulk alloy; with the predominantly amorphous layer having the lowest current density. Examination of corroded samples following potentiodynamic tests reveals that cracks limit the effectiveness of the treated layer as a barrier to corrosion. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

"This essay examines the films of Chilewood, a collaboration between Chilean director Nicolas Lopez and U.S. director Eli Roth and which is based in Santiago, Chile. Chilewood's films underscore a stylistic fragmentation in contemporary Chilean cinema, which largely rests on a distinction between genre cinema and auteur cinema. Within the Chilewood endeavour, Chile serves as a node of production for genre cinema (romantic comedies, comedies, disaster films, thrillers, horror) for both domestic audiences and international audiences. While Chilewood's films provide an instance to examine different forms of transnationalism through production, financing and content, these same facets can be assessed for their neoliberal aspects that vary with each production."
"Cd1-XFeXSe thin films were electrodeposited onto fluorine doped tin oxide coated conducting glass (PTO) and stainless steel (SS) substrates at various bath compositions with X=0.1 to 0.5 in an aqueous electrolytic bath containing CdSO4, FeSO4 and SeO2. The effects of different compositions on physicochemical properties of Cd1-XFeXSe thin films have been systematically investigated. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis reveals the polycrystalline in nature of Cd1-XFeXS thin films. Field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM) micrographs shows the variation in the nanostructure with varying compositions. The Cd1-XFeXSe thin films exhibited the water contact angles in hydrophilic range. Optical absorption measurements are used to estimate the band gap value of Cd1-XFeXSe thin films deposited at various bath compositions. The dramatic changes in surface morphology, as a consequence of different composition of Fe in CdSe matrix, significantly alter the conversion efficiency of Cd1-XFeXSe films.

"Apoptosis-related protein B-cell lymphoma-extra large (Bcl-xL) has a crucial role in the control of cell death through its inhibition of apoptosis. This study was designed to investigate the expression of Bcl-xL in relation to the development of tongue carcinoma and whether it has potential as a marker for the clinical diagnosis of tongue carcinoma and as a therapeutic target to evaluate the dynamic of tongue carcinoma progression. A statistical analysis of 100 cases oral tongue carcinoma tissue specimens were performed using pathological grading and clinical TNM staging, and 14 cases corresponding non-tumor tissues as control. The changes in Bcl-xL mRNA expression between different pathological grades and clinical TNM stages of tissue were analyzed by RT-PCR. Additionally, immunohistochemical SP method and Western blot assays were employed to detect changes in Bcl-xL protein expression in different tongue carcinoma tissues. The results showed the expression of Bcl-xL was significantly higher in tongue carcinoma tissues than in normal tongue tissues and was positively associated with the degree of differentiation and the clinical TNM staging, but negatively correlated with the degree of malignancy of the tumor. There was higher expression of Bcl-xL in oral tongue squamous cell carcinoma (OTSCC) tissues compared with oral tongue adenocarcinoma (OTA) tissues, but Bcl-xL expression in tissue with lymph node metastasis was significantly higher than that without lymph node metastasis. Thus, Bcl-xL overexpression may be closely related to the dynamic of the pathogenesis and development of tongue carcinoma. It may be a useful marker for clinical diagnosis and an aid to evaluating the efficacy of therapeutics in tongue carcinoma."
Rapidly solidified aluminum alloys are promising materials with very fine microstructure. The microscopy observation of these materials is complicated due to overlay of fcc-Al matrix and different intermetallic phases. A possible way to solve this problem is to dissolve the Al matrix. By this process powder formed by single intermetallic phase particles is obtained. In this paper a new aqueous based dissolving agent for Al-based alloy is presented. The influence of oxidation agent (FeCl3) concentration on quality of extraction process was studied. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.
"Nasal NK/T-cell lymphoma (NNKTL) is an Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-associated malignancy and has distinct clinical and histological features. However, its genetic features are hitherto unclear. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) play a crucial role in the pathogenesis of several malignancies via regulating gene expression. In this study, we investigated whether the specific microRNAs were related to the tumor behaviors in NNKTL. MiRNA array and Quantitative RT-PCR analyses revealed that miR-15a was expressed at a much lower level in NNKTL cells (SNK-1, SNK-6, and SNT-8) than in normal peripheral NK cells and EBV-negative NK cell line KHYG-1. Quantitative PCR and western blot analyses showed that the expression of MYB and cyclin D1, which are validated targets of miR-15a, was higher in NNKTL cells. Transfection of NNKTL cells (SNK-6 and SNT-8) with a miR-15a precursor decreased MYB and cyclin D1 levels, thereby blocking G1/S transition and cell proliferation. Knockdown of EBV-encoded latent membrane protein 1 (LMP1) significantly increased miR-15a expression in SNK-6 cells. In NNKTL tissues, we found that reduced miR-15a expression, which correlated with MYB and cyclin D1 expression, was associated with poor prognosis of NNKTL patients. These data suggest that downregulation of miR-15a, possibly due to LMP1, implicates in the pathogenesis of NNKTL by inducing cell proliferation via MYB and cyclin D1. Thus, miR-15a could be a potential target for antitumor therapy and a prognostic predictor for NNKTL. Am. J. Hematol. 89:25-33, 2014. (c) 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc."
"A novel network architecture to be deployed in Korea is so called HTN (highly trusted network). The aim of HTN is the seamless communication of information in a secure manner, anytime and anywhere, in the national administration network infrastructure. In this paper, we present the results of information security modeling for the HTN. Through the use of security modeling procedure, we derive the requirements and corresponding technology for security control of the system by analyzing threat elements and attack possibility. First we analyze threat of each component for the HTN by STRIDE modeling and later construct an attack tree by analyzing attack examples for every threat. Finally we propose the security requirements and technology to respond against them, based on the analyzed threats and attack examples."
"Objective: The aim of this article is to compare the efficacy and safety of doripenem for bacterial infections. Methods: We included six randomized clinical trials identified from PubMed and Embase up to July 31, 2014. The included trials compared efficacy and safety of doripenem for complicated intra-abdominal infections, complicated urinary tract infection, nosocomial pneumonia, and acute biliary tract infection. The meta-analysis was carried on by the statistical software of Review Manager, version 5.2. Results: Compared with empirical antimicrobial agents on overall treatment efficacy, doripenem was associated with similar clinical and microbiological treatment success rates (for the clinical evaluable population, odds ratio [OR] = 1.26, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.93-1.69, p = 0.13; for clinical modified intent-to-treatment population, OR = 0.88, 95% CI 0.55-1.41, p = 0.60; for microbiology evaluable population, OR = 1.16, 95% CI 0.90-1.50, p = 0.26; for microbiological modified intent-to-treatment (m-mITT), OR = 0.98, 95% CI 0.81-1.20, p = 0.87). We compared incidence of adverse events and all-cause mortality to analyze treatment safety. The outcomes suggested that doripenem was similar to comparators in terms of incidence of adverse events and all-cause mortality on modified intent-to-treatment population (for incidence of AEs, OR = 1.10, 95% CI 0.90-1.35, p = 0.33; for all-cause mortality, OR = 1.08, 95% CI 0.77-1.51, p = 0.67). In nosocomial pneumonia and ventilator-associated pneumonia treatment, doripenem was not inferior to other antibacterial agents in terms of efficacy and safety. Conclusion: From this meta-analysis, we can conclude that doripenem is as valuable and well tolerated than empirical antimicrobial agents for complicated intra-abdominal infections, complicated urinary tract infection, acute biliary tract infection and nosocomial pneumonia treatment.

"Switch-induced developmental plasticity, such as the diapause decision in insects, is a major form of adaptation to variable environments. As individuals that follow alternative developmental pathways will experience different selective environments the diapause decision may evolve to a cascade switch that induces additional adaptive developmental differences downstream of the diapause decision. Here, we show that individuals following alternative developmental pathways in a Swedish population of the butterfly, Pararge aegeria, display differential optimization of adult body mass as a likely response to predictable differences in thermal conditions during reproduction. In a more northern population where this type of selection is absent no similar difference in adult mass among pathways was found. We conclude that the diapause decision in the southern population appears to act as a cascade switch, coordinating development downstream of the diapause decision, to produce adult phenotypes adapted to the typical thermal conditions of their expected reproductive period."
"An asymmetric heterotopic ligand (S-(NCP)-C-Me) containing a central bicyclic, expanded-ring NHC with one pyridyl and one phosphine exo-substituent has been synthesised and its coordination chemistry with selected late transition metals investigated. The amidinium precursor [S-(NCHP)-C-Me] PF6 shows variable coordination modes with Ag(I), Cu(I) and Au(I) depending on the L : M ratio. The reaction of two mols of [S-(NCHP)-C-Me] PF6 with [Cu(MeCN)(4)] BF4, AgBF4 or Au(THT) Cl gives the bis-ligand complexes [Cu(kappa-P-(NCHP)-C-Me)(2)(CH3CN)(2)]BF4,center dot(PF6)(2), 1, and [M(kappa-P-(NCHP)-C-Me)(2)] X center dot(PF6)(2) (3: M = Ag, X = BF4; 6: M = Au, X = Cl) respectively. The 1 : 1 reaction of [S-(NCHP)-C-Me]PF6 with AgOTf gave the head-to-tail dimer H, T-[Ag-2(mu-N,P-(NCHP)-C-Me)(2)(mu-OTf) (2)](PF6)(2), 2, whereas the analogous reaction with Au(THT)Cl gave monomeric [Au(kappa-P-(NCHP)-C-Me) Cl] PF6, 5. Complex 2 was converted to H, T-[Ag-2(mu-C, P-(NCP)-C-Me)(2)](PF6)(2), 4, upon addition of base, while 6 gave [Au(kappa-C-(NCP)-C-Me)(2)]Cl, 8, when treated likewise. Reaction of [S-(NCHP)-C-Me]PF6 with Ni(1,5-COD)(2) gave the oxidative addition/insertion product [Ni(kappa(3)-N, C, P-(NCP)-C-Me)(eta(3)-C8H13)]PF6, 9, which converted to [Ni(kappa(3)-N, C, P-(NCP)-C-Me)Cl)]PF6, 10, upon exposure of a CHCl3 solution to air. Complex 10 showed conformational isomerism that was also present in [Rh(kappa(3)-N, C, P-(NCP)-C-Me)(CO)]PF6, 14, prepared from the precursor complex [Rh(kappa-P-(NCHP)-C-Me)(acac)(CO)]PF6, 13, upon heating in C6H5Cl. [Pt(kappa(3)-N, C, P-(NCP)-C-Me)(Cl)] PF6, 12, derived from trans-[Pt(kappa-P-(NCHP)-C-Me)(2)(Cl)(2)](PF6)(2), 11, was isolated as a single conformer."
"A novel complex [Cd(mef)(2)(CH3OH)](n), 1, has been synthesized by the interaction of Cd(II) with the non-steroidal antiinflammatory drug mefenamic acid, mef, which has been structurally characterized by spectral (IR, UV-Vis) and X-ray crystallography. This complex is a 1D polymer, consisting of hepta-coordinated Cd atoms connected by six oxygen atoms from four different mef ligands and one oxygen atom from a methanol molecule. The coordination geometry around each metal ion is distorted by the bulky mef ligand. Binding of the synthesized complex with calf thymus DNA (CT-DNA) was investigated by spectroscopic methods (UV-Vis, fluorescence, CD spectroscopy) and viscosity measurements. The complex partially intercalated to DNA with high affinity. The antioxidant activities of ligand mef and complex 1 show this complex has better antioxidant activity than the free ligand. The antimicrobial activities of complex 1 are higher against both bacteria and fungi than free Cd2+ or mef. The cytotoxic effect of compound 1 on the human breast cancer cell line (MCF-7) and the bladder cancer cell line (T24) was also much higher than free Cd2+ or mef. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

"High-k polymer composites are promising candidates for energy-storage capacitors and many other electronic devices. However, balancing the permittivity, loss and breakdown strength remains a challenge for us. Herein, theoretical calculations and experimental studies were simultaneously carried out to develop an original design of sandwich-structured composites consisting of alternating negative-k and positive-k layers toward high performance dielectric applications. It is experimentally proved that the trilayered composites are capable of balancing the two contrasting parameters of permittivity and loss. The introduction of negative-k layers into trilayered composites leads to a higher dielectric constant (epsilon' approximate to 90@10 kHz) and low retained loss (tan delta approximate to 0.025@10 kHz) compared with those of the pristine PVDF (epsilon' approximate to 10@10 kHz, tan delta approximate to 0.020@10 kHz). Moreover, the trilayered composites possess an obviously improved energy-storage capacity which is nearly 3 times higher than those of traditional trilayered composites without negative-k layers. Although the permittivity boost effect is still far below the theoretically predicted results and the mechanisms need to be further clarified, these results undoubtedly validated the feasibility of our design, and multilayer high-k composites with fascinating dielectric performances are expected to emerge in the near future via tailoring the properties of single layers and stacking sequences."
"Several lines of evidence have indicated that rapamycin acts as an inhibitor of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) and this produces therapeutic benefits as a treatment for Alzheimer's disease (AD) by activating an autophagic pathway. Similarly, postoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD) is a decline in cognitive function for weeks or months after surgery. POCD and AD are both characterized by cognitive dysfunction, and more importantly, are both related to aging. We therefore hypothesized that rapamycin may have a therapeutic effect to relieve POCD. Inhibition of mTOR induces autophagic effect, thereby leading to a slower aging process, so this would be a novel target for the prevention and treatment of POCD. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

"This article describes an 8-month-old boy with the full clinical spectrum anti-N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor encephalitis. He was admitted to the hospital with involuntary orofacial head movements, behavioral changes, and fluctuation in consciousness. His examination showed tongue thrusting, decreased responsiveness, and hypotonia without fever. Analysis of the cerebrospinal fluid revealed increased protein levels (62 mg/dL). The next day he developed oral dyskinesia and choreoathetosis. Video-electroencephalogram polygraphy showed coreo-dystonic movements without electrographic correlation. A putative diagnosis of autoimmune encephalopathy was made, and treatment with intravenous immunoglobulin and methylprednisolone was started, with improvement in the abnormal movements. Antibodies to the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor were identified in the cerebrospinal fluid and blood. He began receiving immunoglobulin once a month for a year. Two months after the treatment had started, the involuntary movement disappeared and his development has been normal. N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor encephalitis is a recently identified disorder. This is the youngest case reported. Prompt diagnosis and treatment are important to obtain full recovery. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved."
"The aim of this study was to determine psychophysiological responses and cognitive performance after a single bout of artificial gravity, in order to investigate its use as a potential holistic countermeasure for long-duration human space flight, considering mental health. Sixteen male participants were exposed to two different hypergravity protocols in a randomized order, one providing a constant +2 Gz environment for 30 min, the other providing participants for five times with repeated 3-min intervals of +2 Gz and rest, respectively. EEG was recorded prior, during and after AG. In addition, self-reported mood and cognitive performance was assessed before and after AG exposure. EEG data were analyzed using standardized brain electromagnetic tomography (sLORETA). Beta-1 EEG activity (12-18 Hz) was decreased in the left middle frontal gyrus after the continuous profile. Participants' motivation decreased after continuous artificial gravity, while perceived physical state was increased. The intermittent profile did not induce any changes in the observed parameters. Cognitive performance was not affected by either of both profiles. The continuous profile induced neurophysiological changes, which are considered with negative affect and withdrawal related motivation, according to the model of frontal asymmetry. This notion was further confirmed by decreases in self-reported mood after continuous AG. Therefore, the continuous profile would not be appropriate for the human space flight program. Intermittent AG did not induce any psychophysiological changes and might therefore provide a more appropriate approach as a countermeasure for further investigations."
"Resonant ultrasound spectroscopy has been used to measure the elastic and anelastic behaviour through known structural and magnetic phase transitions in single crystal hexagonal YMnO3. Anomalous elastic behaviour is observed at the high temperature structural transition at similar to 1260 K, with a discontinuity in the elastic constants and nonlinear recovery below T-c, consistent with lambda eQ(s)(2) coupling. There is no change in dissipation associated with this high temperature transition, and no evidence in the elastic or anelastic behaviour for any secondary transition at similar to 920 K, thus supporting the thesis of a single high temperature transformation. Elastic stiffening is observed on cooling through T-N, in accordance with previous studies, and the excess elastic constant appears to scale with the square of the magnetic order parameter. The strains incurred at T-N are a factor of similar to 20 smaller than those at the structural transition, implying very weak lambda eQ(m)(2) coupling and a dominant contribution to the variation in the elastic constants from lambda e(2)Q(m)(2). The increased acoustic dissipation above T-N is consistent with an order-disorder process."
"Glutathione transferase Mu 1 (GSTM1) induces cancer drug resistance by hydrolyzing cancer chemotherapeutics or activating the anti-apoptosis pathway. However, the chemoresistance-inducing mechanism of GSTM1 in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains unknown. In the present study, the expression of GSTM1 was examined in three HCC cell lines. Oxaliplatin and sorafenib were selected as chemotherapeutic agents. Small interfering RNA was used to decrease GSTM1 expression. Cell death was measured using MTT and annexin V/propidium iodide assays. Activation of autophagy was evaluated by green fluorescent protein-light chain 3 redistribution and analysis of autophagy-related 5 expression in MHCC97-H and Huh-7 cells. A stepwise increase in GSTM1 expression with increasing metastatic potential of HCC cell lines was revealed. Cell death induced by oxaliplatin and sorafenib was significantly increased following GSTM1-knockdown in MHCC97-H and Huh-7 cells. Activation of autophagy was significantly inhibited by silencing GSTM1 expression. The results of the present study suggest that GSTM1 may protect HCC cells against the effect of oxaliplatin treatment through activating autophagy. The present study provides a novel perspective on HCC drug-resistance."
"In order to explore potent pesticide containing heterocycle, fourteen new 1-aroyl-3-[4-((2-cyanoimino-1,3-thiazolidine-3-yl)methyl)-thiazol-2-yl]thiourea compounds were designed and synthesized by introducing the important acylthiourea moiety into the molecular structure of thiazole. Their structures were identified by H-1 NMR spectra and elemental analysis. The preliminary bioassay revealed that some compounds showed certain fungicidal, plant growth regulatory or herbicidal activities."
"IMPORTANCE The study of brain activity and connectivity at rest provides a unique opportunity for the investigation of the brain substrates of cognitive outcome after traumatic axonal injury. This knowledge may contribute to improve clinical management and rehabilitation programs. OBJECTIVE To study functional magnetic resonance imaging abnormalities in signal amplitude and brain connectivity at rest and their relationship to cognitive outcome in patients with chronic and severe traumatic axonal injury. DESIGN Observational study. SETTING University of Barcelona and Hospital Clinic de Barcelona, Barcelona, and Institut Guttmann-Neurorehabilitation Hospital, Badalona, Spain. PARTICIPANTS Twenty patients with traumatic brain injury (TBI) were studied, along with 17 matched healthy volunteers. INTERVENTIONS Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging and diffusion tensor imaging data were acquired. After exploring group differences in amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations (ALFF), we studied functional connectivity within the default mode network (DMN) by means of independent component analysis, followed by a dual regression approach and seed-based connectivity analyses. Finally, we performed probabilistic tractography between the frontal and posterior nodes of the DMN. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Signal amplitude and functional connectivity during the resting state, tractography related to DMN, and the association between signal amplitudes and cognitive outcome. RESULTS Patients had greater ALFF in frontal regions, which was correlated with cognitive performance. Within the DMN, patients showed increased connectivity in the frontal lobes. Seed-based connectivity analyses revealed augmented connectivity within surrounding areas of the frontal and left parietal nodes of the DMN. Fractional anisotropy of the cingulate tract was correlated with increased connectivity of the frontal node of the DMN in patients with TBI. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Increased ALFF is related to better cognitive performance in chronic TBI. The loss of structural connectivity produced by damage to the cingulum tract explained the compensatory increases in functional connectivity within the frontal node of the DMN."
"Metal ions sorption can be significantly affected by the presence of other sorbates, especially of complexing ligands. In this study, the effect of Se(IV) on Eu(III) sorption onto TiO2 at different pH and Eu(III) concentration was investigated. Se(IV) was found to enhance Eu(III) sorption as a function of Se(IV) concentration. Constant capacitance model was successfully used to interpret the sorption experimental data. The solubility product of Eu-2(SeO3)(3) at ambient temperature was investigated to highlight the sorption mechanism of ternary sorption system. The pK(sp) value of Eu-2(SeO3)(3) was found to be 31.51 +/- 0.95."
"Given current pressures to increase the public health contributions of behavioral interventions, intervention scientists may wish to consider moving beyond the classical treatment package approach that focuses primarily on achieving statistical significance. They may wish also to focus on goals directly related to optimizing public health impact. The Multiphase Optimization Strategy (MOST) is an innovative methodological framework that draws on engineering principles to achieve more potent behavioral interventions. MOST is increasingly being adopted by intervention scientists seeking a systematic framework to engineer an optimized intervention. As with any innovation, there are challenges that arise with early adoption. This article describes the solutions to several critical questions that we addressed during the first-ever iterative application of MOST. Specifically, we describe how we have applied MOST to optimize an online program (myPlaybook) for the prevention of substance use among college student-athletes. Our application of MOST can serve as a blueprint for other intervention scientists who wish to design optimized behavioral interventions. We believe using MOST is feasible and has the potential to dramatically improve program effectiveness thereby advancing the public health impact of behavioral interventions."
"The distribution of damage controlled by brittle particles crush in AA7075-T6 beneath spherical indenter was obtained experimentally and predicted analytically. Micro hardness tests were conducted on the vertical sections across the indentation impression and by comparing it with the estimated ideal micro hardness, the damage beneath spherical indenter can be quantified. In the present study, for a spherical indenter with 794 mu m radius and a 117 mu m penetration, maximum damage is 0.29, locating in the middle of the contact arc. The damage along path 1, which is right below the indentation impression, has generally smaller damage and the path 3, which is below the middle of the contact arc, has more extensive damage. Through a model which can describe the damage controlled by second phase particles crush, a modified expanding cavity model (ECM) coupling with the Ramberg-Osgood stress-strain relation was applied to predict the distribution of damage in spherical indentation deformation. By comparing with the experimental results, it proved that the method could give a prediction with reasonable accuracy."
"This study investigates the mark-up on average costs in the U.S. manufacturing industry at the aggregate and two-digit industry levels. We first analyze the behavior of profit margins over seven business cycles between 1958 and 1996 and establish some stylized facts for the cyclical dynamics of mark-ups. Second, we look at the secular movements in margins of profits through a simple trend decomposition of the aggregate and two-digit mark-ups. We find that: (1) the aggregate and the majority of two-digit mark-ups behave pro-cyclically; and (2) the trend in margins of profits in the period is explained by a marked rise in the rate of surplus value and a fall in the composition of capital, indicating labor-saving/capital-using technical change.

"Background: Tree peonies are great ornamental plants associated with a rich ethnobotanical history in Chinese culture and have recently been used as an evolutionary model. The Qinling Mountains represent a significant geographic barrier in Asia, dividing mainland China into northern (temperate) and southern (semi-tropical) regions; however, their flora has not been well analyzed. In this study, the genetic differentiation and genetic structure of Paeonia rockii and the role of the Qinling Mountains as a barrier that has driven intraspecific fragmentation were evaluated using 14 microsatellite markers. Methodology/Principal Findings: Twenty wild populations were sampled from the distributional range of P. rockii. Significant population differentiation was suggested (F-ST value of 0.302). Moderate genetic diversity at the population level (H-S of 0.516) and high population diversity at the species level (H-T of 0.749) were detected. Significant excess homozygosity (F-IS of 0.076) and recent population bottlenecks were detected in three populations. Bayesian clusters, population genetic trees and principal coordinate analysis all classified the P. rockii populations into three genetic groups and one admixed Wenxian population. An isolation-by-distance model for P. rockii was suggested by Mantel tests (r = 0.6074, P<0.001) and supported by AMOVA (P<0.001), revealing a significant molecular variance among the groups (11.32%) and their populations (21.22%). These data support the five geographic boundaries surrounding the Qinling Mountains and adjacent areas that were detected with Monmonier's maximum-difference algorithm. Conclusions/Significance: Our data suggest that the current genetic structure of P. rockii has resulted from the fragmentation of a formerly continuously distributed large population following the restriction of gene flow between populations of this species by the Qinling Mountains. This study provides a fundamental genetic profile for the conservation and responsible exploitation of the extant germplasm of this species and for improving the genetic basis for breeding its cultivars."
"Ultraviolet (UV) observations of local star-forming galaxies have begun to establish an empirical baseline for interpreting the rest-UV spectra of reionization-era galaxies. However, existing high-ionization emission line measurements al z > 6 (W-CIV,W-0 greater than or similar to 20 angstrom) are uniformly stronger than observed locally (W-CIV,W-0 less than or similar to 2 angstrom), likely due to the relatively high metallicities (Z/Z(circle dot) > 0.1) typically probed by UV surveys of nearby galaxies. We present new HST/COS spectra of six nearby (z < 0.01) extremely metal-poor galaxies (XMPs, Z/Z(circle dot) less than or similar to 0.1) targeted to address this limitation and provide constraints on the highly uncertain ionizing spectra powered by low-metallicity massive stars. Our data reveal a range of spectral features, including one of the most prominent nebular CIv doublets yet observed in local star-forming systems and strong He H. emission. Using all published UV observations of local XMPs to date, we find that nebular C IV emission is ubiquitous in very high specific star formation rate systems at low metallicity, but still find equivalent widths smaller than those measured in individual lensed systems at z > 6. Our moderate-resolution HST/COS data allow us to conduct an analysis of the stellar winds in a local nebular C iv emitter, which suggests that some of the tension with z > 6 data may be due to existing local samples not yet probing sufficiently high alpha/Fe abundance ratios. Our results indicate that C iv emission can play a crucial role in the IWST and ELT era by acting as an accessible signpost of very low metallicity (Z/Z(circle dot)) < 0.1) massive stars in assembling reionization-era systems."
"Parasite host specificity has important implications for species diversity estimates, food web dynamics, and host shifts. ""White grub'' is the metacercaria stage of a fluke (Posthodiplostomum minimum) that occurs in many fish species, but no attempt has been made to quantify variation in host use by this worm. Here we used 2 approaches to evaluate host specificity within the strain that infects centrarchids (P. minimum centrarchi). First, we measured parasite loads in 2 centrarchid hosts, bluegill (Lepomis macrochirus) and white crappie (Pomoxis annularis), from Spring Lake in McDonough County, Illinois. We found that infection levels differed significantly between these hosts. Prevalence in bluegill was 100% and the median intensity was 940 metacercariae, but only 57% of white crappie were infected (median intensity = 4). Site specificity of white grub also differed significantly between the 2 hosts. In bluegills, kidneys were most heavily infected, whereas in white crappies, livers harbored the most worms. We also performed a literature survey of P. minimum prevalence estimates from 14 centrarchid species from other localities. We calculated the mean white grub prevalence for each host species and used this to calculate S-TD*, a quantitative index of host specificity. S-TD* was 1.33, significantly closer to the value for a specialist (S-TD* = 1.00) than a generalist (S-TD* = 2.00). This reflects the fact that P. minimum prevalence is higher in Lepomis species than it is in centrarchids outside this genus. These data show that P. minimum centrarchi specializes on Lepomis species, but the causes of this specialization are unknown. This worm may be a single species that differs in host use due to ecological or physiological host differences, or it may be a complex of species that vary in host use for similar reasons. Genetic data are required to evaluate these possibilities."
"A Rhodospirillum rubrum gene that is predicted to code for an extracellular poly(3-hydroxybutyrate) (PHB) depolymerase by the recently published polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHA) depolymerase engineering database was cloned. The gene product (PhaZ3 (Rru) ) was expressed in recombinant E. coli, purified and biochemically characterized. PhaZ3 (Rru) turned out, however, to share characteristics of intracellular PHB depolymerases and revealed a combination of properties that have not yet been described for other PHB depolymerases. A fusion of PhaZ3 (Rru) with the enhanced cyan fluorescent protein was able to bind to PHB granules in vivo and supported the function as an intracellular PHB depolymerase. Purified PhaZ3 (Rru) was specific for short-chain-length polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHA(SCL)) and hydrolysed both untreated native PHB granules as well as trypsin-activated native PHB granules to a mixture of mono- and dimeric 3-hydroxybutyrate. Crystalline (denatured) PHB granules were not hydrolysed by PhayZ3 (Rru) . Low concentrations of calcium or magnesium ions (1-5 mM) reversibly (EDTA) inhibited the enzyme. Our data suggest that PhaZ3 (Rru) is the representative of a new type of the growing number of intracellular PHB depolymerases."
"The objective of this study was to compare cancer diagnoses by age, gender, and sexual orientation. This study used data on 129,431 heterosexual adults and 3,357 lesbian, gay, and bisexual (LGB) adults in the 2013-2016 National Health Interview Survey. Logistic regression models compared the prevalence of cancer diagnoses by sexual orientation while controlling for demographics, socioeconomic status, and health profiles. Then, using coefficients from fully adjusted models, we estimated average marginal effects to compare the probability of a cancer diagnosis by sexual orientation across five age categories. After controlling for demographic and socioeconomic characteristics, gay men (odds ratio [OR] 1.54; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.10-2.18) were more likely to have been diagnosed with cancer compared to heterosexual men, and bisexual women (OR 1.70; 95% CI 1.16-2.48) were more likely to have been diagnosed with cancer compared to heterosexual women. Gay men aged 65 years and older were 6.0% points (p < 0.05) more likely to be diagnosed with cancer compared to heterosexual men of the same age. Bisexual women aged 65 years and older were 7.6% points (p < 0.05) more likely to be diagnosed with cancer compared to women of the same age. Some sexual minorities may be at greater risk for cancer (or having a personal history of cancer) compared to heterosexuals. More research on cancer detection, treatment, and survivorship in sexual minorities is critically needed. Health care providers and public health practitioners should be aware of the unique health care needs in LGB adults, including their elevated cancer risks."
"This paper investigates the so-called tertiary instabilities driven by the zonal flow in gyro-kinetic tokamak core turbulence. The Kelvin Helmholtz instability is first considered within a 2D fluid model and a threshold in the zonal flow wave vector k(ZF) > k(ZF,c) for instability is found. This critical scale is related to the breaking of the rotational symmetry by flux-surfaces, which is incorporated into the modified adiabatic electron response. The stability of undamped Rosenbluth-Hinton zonal flows is then investigated in gyro-kinetic simulations. Absolute instability, in the sense that the threshold zonal flow amplitude tends towards zero, is found above a zonal flow wave vector k(ZF),(c rho i) approximate to 1.3 (rho(i) is the ion thermal Larmor radius), which is comparable to the 2D fluid results. Large scale zonal flows with k(ZF) < k(ZF,c) are unstable for sufficiently large amplitudes with increasing trend for an increasing radial scale. However, the critical E X B-shearing rate associated with the stability boundary omega(EXB,c) exceeds typical values connected to the pure flow state at marginal stability by more than an order of magnitude, which therefore lies deeply in the stable parameter region. Furthermore, the impact of zonal temperature perturbations on the tertiary instability is examined. Although temperature perturbations favor instability, the realistic values of gradient-driven gyro-kinetic simulations still lie deeply in the stable parameter regime. Therefore, the relevance of the tertiary instability as a saturation mechanism to the zonal flow amplitude is questioned, as most of the zonal flow intensity is concentrated in modes satisfying k(ZF) << k(ZF,c) as well as omega(EXB) << omega(EXB,c).

"A number of studies have established that plant growth and development in oilseed rape (Brassica napus L.) are hampered by salinity stress. Nowadays, researchers have focused on the use of plant growth regulators to increase plant tolerance against salinity. An experiment was performed to evaluate the effects of 5-aminolevulinic acid (ALA, 30 mg l(-1)) on Brassica napus L. (cv. 'ZS 758') plants under NaCl (100, 200 mM) salinity. Data presented here were recorded on two different leaf positions (first and third) to have a better understanding of the ameliorative role of ALA on NaCl-stressed oilseed rape plants. Results have shown that increasing salinity imposed negative impact on relative growth rate (root and shoot) and leaf water relations (osmotic potential and relative water content), whereas enhanced the level of relative conductivity, malondialdehyde (MDA) content, osmolytes (soluble sugar, soluble protein, free amino acid and proline) concentration, reactive oxygen species (ROS), and enzymatic (ascorbate peroxidase, guaiacol peroxidase, catalase and superoxide dismutase) and non-enzymatic (reduced glutathione and ascorbate) antioxidants activity in two different leaf position samples. Foliar application of ALA improved relative growth rate (root and shoot) and leaf water relations (osmotic potential and relative water content), and also triggered the further accumulation of osmolytes (soluble sugar, soluble protein, free amino acid and proline) as well as enzymatic (ascorbate peroxidase, guaiacol peroxidase, catalase and superoxide dismutase) and non-enzymatic (reduced glutathione and ascorbate) antioxidants activity in both leaf samples, whereas decreased the membrane permeability, MDA content and ROS production. Our results also indicate that osmolytes are preferentially accumulated in younger tissues."
"The differential pharmacological responsiveness of cephalic and extra-cephalic neuropathic pain has been proposed to relate to distinct mechanisms that may involve neuroinflammatory reactions mediated by glial cells. Astrocytes are particularly important for neuronal sensitization in neuropathic pain, in part through modulation of glutamatergic transmission. Because the metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 (mGluR5) is involved in the astrocytic regulation of the glutamatergic system, we investigated modifications of its expression in models of cephalic versus extra-cephalic neuropathic pain. Adult male rats underwent unilateral chronic constriction injury (CCI) of either the infraorbital nerve (ION) or the sciatic nerve (SN). Seven days later, mGluR5 and the astrocyte marker GFAP (glial fibrillary acidic protein) were overexpressed and appeared localized mainly in the superficial lamina of the trigeminal nucleus in CCI-ION and the spinal cord dorsal horn in CCI-SN rats. In addition, colocalization of GFAP and mGluR5 strongly suggested an increase of astrocytic mGluR5 expression in nerve-injured rats compared to sham animals. The present data show an upregulation of astrocytic mGIuR5 in central structures in both CCI-ION and CCI-SN. This suggests that the pharmacological modulation of mGIuR5 could be a new approach to reduce both cephalic and extra-cephalic neuropathic pain. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."

"A generation-2 (Gen-2) handheld optical imager capable of two-dimensional surface and three-dimensional tomographic imaging has recently been developed. Herein, the ability of the handheld imager to detect and resolve two targets under diffuse and fluorescence imaging conditions has been demonstrated via tissue phantom studies. Two-dimensional surface imaging studies demonstrated that two 0.96 cm diameter Indocyannine Green targets were detected and resolved similar to 0.5 cm apart (between edges) at a target depth of 1 cm during diffuse imaging and up to 2 cm depth during fluorescence imaging.

"Background: Allergic rhinitis is regarded as an imbalanced Th1/Th2 cell-mediated response. The present study used microarray analysis to compare gene expression levels between allergic rhinitis patients before and after a series of acupoint herbal plaster applications. Methods: In this experimental pilot study, volunteers experiencing sneezing, runny nose, and congestion for more than 9 months in the year following initial diagnoses were included after diagnostic confirmation by otolaryngologists to exclude patients with sinusitis and nasal polyps. Patients with persistent allergic rhinitis each received four acupoint herbal plaster treatments applied using the moxibustion technique. Clinical outcomes were evaluated using the Rhinitis Quality of Life Questionnaire (RQLQ). Peripheral blood samples were analyzed using an ImmunoCAP Phadiatop test, and patients were classified as phadiatop (Ph)-positive or -negative. Microarray results were analyzed for genes that were differentially expressed between (1) Ph-positive and -negative patients treated with herbal plaster; and (2) before and after herbal plaster treatment in the Ph-positive patient group. Unsupervised and supervised methods were used for gene-expression data analysis. Results: Nineteen Ph-positive and four Ph-negative participants with persistent allergic rhinitis were included in the study. RQLQ results indicated that the 19 Ph-positive volunteers experienced improvement in six of seven categories following acupoint herbal plaster treatments, whereas the four Ph-negative participants reported improvement in only two categories. Hierarchical clustering and principle component analysis of the gene expression profiles of Ph-positive and -negative participants indicated the groups exhibited distinct physiological responses to acupoint herbal treatment. Evaluation of gene networks using MetaCore identified that the ""Immune response_IL-13 signaling via JAK-STAT"" and the ""Inflammation_Interferon signaling"" were down- and up-regulated, respectively, among Ph-positive subjects. Conclusions: In this preliminary study, we find that the IL-13 immune response via JAK-STAT signaling and interferon inflammation signaling were down- and upregulated, respectively, in the Ph-positive group. Further studies are required to verify these pathways in Ph-positive patients, and to determine the mechanism of such pathway dysregulation."
"Myeloperoxidase-antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody-associated vasculitis (MPO-AAV) does not usually involve large vessels, such as the aorta. However, we experienced three cases having an aortic aneurysm as a complication of MPO-AAV with renal insufficiency. In one patient it involved the onset of descending aortic dissection during treatment for MPO-AAV; another two patients had an abdominal aortic aneurysm at the time of our diagnosis of MPO-AAV. Although we found no pathological evidence in our patients, MPO-AAV might result in large vessel inflammation. Therefore, we suggest that patients with MPO-AAV should be examined by computed tomography scan to check for the presence of an aortic aneurysm."
"Testicular germ cell tumors (TGCTs) are the most common solid cancers in young men, with an increasing incidence over several years. However, their pathogenesis remains a matter of debate. Some epidemiological data suggest the involvement of both environmental and genetic factors. We reported two distinct effects of estrogens and/or xeno-estrogens on in vitro human seminoma-derived cells proliferation: (1) an antiproliferative effect via a classical estrogen receptor beta-dependent pathway, and (2) a promotive effect via a non-classical membrane G-protein-coupled receptor, GPR30/GPER, which is only overexpressed in seminomas, the most common TGCT. In order to explain this overexpression, we investigated the possible association of polymorphisms in the GPER gene by using allele-specific tetra-primer polymerase chain reaction performed on tissue samples from 150 paraffin-embedded TGCT specimens (131 seminomas, 19 non seminomas). Compared to control population, loss of homozygous ancestral genotype GG in two polymorphisms located in the promoter region of GPER (rs3808350 and rs3808351) was more frequent in seminomas but not in non-seminomas (respectively, OR = 1.960 (1.172-3.277) and 7.000 (2.747-17.840); p < 0.01). These polymorphisms may explain GPER overexpression and represent a genetic factor of susceptibility supporting the contribution of environmental GPER ligands in testicular carcinogenesis."
"Skeletal muscle represents around 40% of whole body mass. The principal function of skeletal muscle is the conversion of chemical energy toward mechanic energy to ensure the development of force, provide movement and locomotion, and maintain posture. This crucial energy dependence is maintained by the faculty of the skeletal muscle for being a central place as a ""reservoir"" of amino acids and carbohydrates in the whole body. A fundamental post-translational modification, named O-GlcNAcylation, depends, inter alia, on these nutrients; it consists to the transfer or the removal of a unique monosaccharide (N-acetyl-D-glucosamine) to a serine or threonine hydroxyl group of nucleocytoplasmic and mitochondrial proteins in a dynamic process by the O-GlcNAc Transferase (OGT) and the O-GlcNAcase (OGA), respectively. O-GlcNAcylation has been shown to be strongly involved in crucial intracellular mechanisms through the modulation of signaling pathways, gene expression, or cytoskeletal functions in various organs and tissues, such as the brain, liver, kidney or pancreas, and linked to the etiology of associated diseases. In recent years, several studies were also focused on the role of O-GlcNAcylation in the physiology and the physiopathology of skeletal muscle. These studies were mostly interested in O-GlcNAcylation during muscle exercise or muscle-wasting conditions. Major findings pointed out a different ""O-GlcNAc signature"" depending on muscle type metabolism at resting, wasting and exercise conditions, as well as depending on acute or long-term exhausting exercise protocol. First insights showed some differential OGT/OGA expression and/or activity associated with some differential stress cellular responses through Reactive Oxygen Species and/or Heat-Shock Proteins. Robust data displayed that these O-GlcNAc changes could lead to (i) a differential modulation of the carbohydrates metabolism, since the majority of enzymes are known to be O-GlcNAcylated, and to (ii) a differential modulation of the protein synthesis/degradation balance since O-GlcNAcylation regulates some key signaling pathways such as Akt/GSK3 beta, Akt/mTOR, Myogenin/Atrogin-1, Myogenin/Mef2D, Mrf4 and PGC-1 alpha in the skeletal muscle. Finally, such involvement of O-GlcNAcylation in some metabolic processes of the skeletal muscle might be linked to some associated diseases such as type 2 diabetes or neuromuscular diseases showing a critical increase of the global O-GlcNAcylation level."
"This investigation assessed the biomechanical performance of the metal plate and bone strut technique for fixing recalcitrant nonunions of femur midshaft segmental defects, which has not been systematically done before. A finite element (FE) model was developed and then validated by experiments with the femur in 15 deg of adduction at a subclinical hip force of 1 kN. Then, FE analysis was done with the femur in 15 deg of adduction at a hip force of 3 kN representing about 4 x body weight for a 75 kg person to examine clinically relevant cases, such as an intact femur plus 8 different combinations of a lateral metal plate of fixed length, a medial bone strut of varying length, and varying numbers and locations of screws to secure the plate and strut around a midshaft defect. Using the traditional ""high stiffness"" femur-implant construct criterion, the repair technique using both a lateral plate and a medial strut fixed with the maximum possible number of screws would be the most desirable since it had the highest stiffness (1948 N/mm); moreover, this produced a peak femur cortical Von Mises stress (92 MPa) which was below the ultimate tensile strength of cortical bone. Conversely, using the more modern ""low stiffness"" femur-implant construct criterion, the repair technique using only a lateral plate but no medial strut provided the lowest stiffness (606 N/mm), which could potentially permit more in-line interfragmentary motion (i.e., perpendicular to the fracture gap, but in the direction of the femur shaft long axis) to enhance callus formation for secondary-type fracture healing; however, this also generated a peak femur cortical Von Mises stress (171 MPa) which was above the ultimate tensile strength of cortical bone."
"This protocol describes an analytical platform for the analysis of intra-and extracellular metabolites of microbial cells (yeast, filamentous fungi and bacteria) using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). The protocol is subdivided into sampling, sample preparation, chemical derivatization of metabolites, GC-MS analysis and data processing and analysis. This protocol uses two robust quenching methods for microbial cultures, the first of which, cold glycerol-saline quenching, causes reduced leakage of intracellular metabolites, thus allowing a more reliable separation of intra-and extracellular metabolites with simultaneous stopping of cell metabolism. The second, fast filtration, is specifically designed for quenching filamentous micro-organisms. These sampling techniques are combined with an easy sample-preparation procedure and a fast chemical derivatization reaction using methyl chloroformate. This reaction takes place at room temperature, in aqueous medium, and is less prone to matrix effect compared with other derivatizations. This protocol takes an average of 10 d to complete and enables the simultaneous analysis of hundreds of metabolites from the central carbon metabolism (amino and nonamino organic acids, phosphorylated organic acids and fatty acid intermediates) using an in-house MS library and a data analysis pipeline consisting of two free software programs (Automated Mass Deconvolution and Identification System (AMDIS) and R)."
"External validation of the paediatric logistic organ dysfunction (PELOD) score in two paediatric intensive care units (PICU) in South America. Prospective observational cohort study including all PICU admissions from July 2003 to December 2004 in Porto Alegre, Brazil, and from January 2004 to December 2004 in Buenos Aires, Argentina. The data collected included demographic variables, diagnosis, need for mechanical ventilation, length of PICU stay and mortality, and the 12 variables in the PELOD score. For each PELOD score variable, the worst daily value and the worst value of the whole PICU stay were used for the daily PELOD (dPELOD) and PELOD scores, respectively. A total of 1,476 admissions (51.3% from Argentina and 48.7% from Brazil) were analysed. Observed and predicted mortality were, respectively, 4.7% and 6.6%, with a standardized mortality ratio of 0.72. The score showed excellent discrimination capacity, with an area under the receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curve of 0.93 (0.88-0.98). The dPELOD score on days 1-5 also showed good discrimination capacities, with areas under the ROC curve > 0.85. However, PELOD and dPELOD scores showed poor calibration with the Hosmer-Lemeshow test (chi-square 72.3, p < 0.001). This poor calibration was explained by a deficiency in the PELOD score where it fails to identify two risk intervals; 3.1-16.2% and 40-80%. The PELOD score is reproducible, has excellent discrimination, but over-predicts mortality and has poor calibration. Although the lack of calibration may not invalidate the score, the PELOD score is a discontinuous variable and we advise careful consideration when using it as a surrogate endpoint in clinical trials."
"Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria is a disorder associated with hemolysis, pancytopenia, and thrombosis due to the loss of the glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchored complement regulatory proteins. The mechanism of thrombosis is multifactorial. Although intravascular hemolysis has been implicated as the etiology, the effect of complement on GPI anchor-deficient platelets, granulocytes, monocytes, and endothelial cells contributes significantly to the risk of thrombosis. Moreover, there appears to be an underlying inflammatory state that is linked to hemostatic activation that may induce thrombosis through a pathway independent of hemolysis."
"Latherin is a highly surface-active allergen protein found in the sweat and saliva of horses and other equids. Its surfactant activity is intrinsic to the protein in its native form, and is manifest without associated lipids or glycosylation. Latherin probably functions as a wetting agent in evaporative cooling in horses, but it may also assist in mastication of fibrous food as well as inhibition of microbial biofilms. It is a member of the PLUNC family of proteins abundant in the oral cavity and saliva of mammals, one of which has also been shown to be a surfactant and capable of disrupting microbial biofilms. How these proteins work as surfactants while remaining soluble and cell membrane-compatible is not known. Nor have their structures previously been reported. We have used protein nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy to determine the conformation and dynamics of latherin in aqueous solution. The protein is a monomer in solution with a slightly curved cylindrical structure exhibiting a 'super-roll' motif comprising a four-stranded anti-parallel beta-sheet and two opposing alpha-helices which twist along the long axis of the cylinder. One end of the molecule has prominent, flexible loops that contain a number of apolar amino acid side chains. This, together with previous biophysical observations, leads us to a plausible mechanism for surfactant activity in which the molecule is first localized to the non-polar interface via these loops, and then unfolds and flattens to expose its hydrophobic interior to the air or non-polar surface. Intrinsically surface-active proteins are relatively rare in nature, and this is the first structure of such a protein from mammals to be reported. Both its conformation and proposed method of action are different from other, non-mammalian surfactant proteins investigated so far."
"This review highlights some of the research advances in anaphylaxis; hypersensitivity reactions to foods, drugs, and insects; and allergic skin disease that were reported in the Journal in 2010. Key epidemiologic observations include an apparent increase in peanut allergy, with more than 1% of children affected, and increasing evidence that early food allergen exposure, rather than avoidance, might improve allergy outcomes. Advances in food allergy diagnosis include improved insights into prognosis and estimation of severity through component-resolved diagnostics and characterization of IgE binding to specific epitopes. Regarding treatment, oral and epicutaneous immunotherapy show promise. Studies of drug allergies show insights into pathophysiology, and studies on insect hypersensitivity reveal improved diagnostic methods. Genetic and functional studies have revealed the important role of epidermal differentiation products in the pathogenesis of atopic dermatitis. Cross-talk between the atopic immune response with the innate immune response have also been found to predispose to infection in patients with atopic dermatitis. New therapeutic approaches to control chronic urticaria have also been identified during the past year. (J Allergy Clin Immunol 2011;127:326-35.)"
"Like the major theme of a Mozart concerto, the immense and pervasive extracellular matrix drives each movement and ultimately closes the symphony, embracing a unique role as the fundamental mediator for most, if not all, ensuing intracellular events. As such, it comes as no surprise that the mechanism of just about every known disease can be traced back to some part of the matrix, typically in the form of an abnormal amount or activity level of a particular matrix component. These defects considerably affect downstream signaling axes leading to overt cellular dysfunction, organ failure, and death. From skin to bone, from vessels to brain, from eyes to all the internal organs, the matrix plays an incredible role as both a cause and potential means to reverse diseases. Human malaises including connective tissue disorders, muscular dystrophy, fibrosis, and cancer are all extracellular matrix-driven diseases. The ability to understand and modulate these matrix-related mechanisms may lead to the future discovery of novel therapeutic options for these patients. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."
"COPD is the third-largest killer in the world, and certainly takes a toll on the health care system. Recurrent COPD exacerbations accelerate lung-function decline, worsen mortality, and consume over US$50 billion in health care spending annually. This has led to a tide of payment reforms eliciting interest in strategies reducing preventable COPD exacerbations. In this review, we analyze and discuss the evidence for COPD action plan-based self-management strategies. Although action plans may provide stabilization of acute symptomatology, there are several limitations. These include patient-centered attributes, such as comprehension and adherence, and nonadherence of health care providers to established guidelines. While no single intervention can be expected independently to translate into improved outcomes, structured together within a comprehensive integrated disease-management program, they may provide a robust paradigm."
"Deep-UV (DUV) laser was used to directly write indium-gallium-zinc-oxide (IGZO) precursor solution and form micro and nanoscale patterns. The directional DUV laser beam avoids the substrate heating and suppresses the diffraction effect. A IGZO precursor solution was also developed to fulfill the requirements for direct photopatterning and for achieving semi-conducting properties with thermal annealing at moderate temperature. The DUV-induced crosslinking of the starting material allows direct write of semi-conducting channels in thin-film transistors but also it improves the field-effect mobility and surface roughness. Material analysis has been carried out by XPS, FTIR, spectroscopic ellipsometry and AFM and the effect of DUV on the final material structure is discussed. The DUV irradiation step results in photolysis and a partial condensation of the inorganic network that freezes the sol-gel layer in a homogeneous distribution, lowering possibilities of thermally induced reorganization at the atomic scale. Laser irradiation allows high-resolution photopatterning and high-enough field-effect mobility, which enables the easy fabrication of oxide nanowires for applications in solar cell, display, flexible electronics, and biomedical sensors."
"Background. We evaluated the potential effects of granulocyte colony-simulating factor (G- CSF) on the incidence of rejection and allograft vasculopathy in heart transplant recipients. Methods. Of 247 patients undergoing heart transplantation from 2000 to 2007, 52 (21%) developed leukopenia (white blood cell [WBC] <2.5 x 10(9)cells/L) in the absence of active infection, rejection, or malignancy. In 24 (46%) patients a clinical decision was made to treat the leukopenia with G-CSF (G-CSF group), and 28 (54%) Patients received no G-CSF (non-GCSF group). Patients followed up for 1 year after the period of leukopenia were assessed for allograft vasculopathy and acute rejection incidence. Results. At baseline, the G-CSF group and the non-GCSF group did not differ in age, gender, race, heart failure etiology, creatinine, left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) or immunosupressive regimen. During 1-year follow-up there were no deaths in the G-CSF group, and 1 death in the non-GCSF group (P = .34). The incidence of rejection or progressive allograft vasculopathy was lower in the G-CSF group when compared with the non-GCSF group (2 [8%] vs 15 [53%]; P < .01). Multivariate analysis identified both prior rejection episodes and G-CSF therapy as factors associated with the combined end-point of rejection or progressive allograft vasculopathy (odds ratio [OR] = 7.89 [1.67-37.2] and OR = 0.09 [0.02-0.52], respectively). Conclusions. G-CSF therapy appears to be associated with a decreased incidence of acute rejection episodes or allograft vasculopathy in heart transplant recipients, suggesting a potential immunomodulatory effect of G-CSF."
"A critical review focused on the Raman spectroscopy of carbonaceous materials and of polymer-based nanocomposites that contain carbonaceous (nano) materials as fillers is presented. The origin, assignment, and parameters (position, intensity, area, width, and shape) of main Raman modes (radial breathing mode, D-mode, G-mode, G'-mode, and so forth) as well as the effect of the interactions of carbonaceous materials on the parameters of these modes is briefly discussed. The effect of dopants and of polymeric matrices on the parameters of Raman bands is succinctly analyzed. The review will provide the basic and most elementary knowledge required to understand and discuss the Raman spectra of carbonaceous materials."
"Objectives: Cochrane meta-analyses have shown significant benefit in bone pain from bisphosphonate therapy in adults with bone diseases such as multiple myeloma, Paget disease, breast and prostate cancer. Our aim was to assess if bisphosphonate treatment could alleviate severe pain in children with Ollier disease and hereditary multiple exostoses that are refractory to standard analgesics. Methods: We report our clinical experience with bisphosphonate therapy in 2 children with cartilage tumors, one with Ollier disease, and the other with hereditary multiple exostoses. Results: We found bisphosphonate therapy to be helpful for pain relief and improving overall ability to carry out daily activities. Discussion: One can consider bisphosphonate therapy in children with Ollier disease and hereditary multiple exostoses who have debilitating pain that is refractory to standard analgesic treatment."
"Distortion of transition-metal ion-oxygen octahedra in perovskite structure has been a long standing subject for exploring the physics of charge-orbital-spin-lattice couplings. Recent findings in nickelates or BaBiO3 have suggested that a charge disproportionation in the transition-metal ions can evoke certain cooperative breathing distortions (CBD), constituted by the symmetric expansion and shrinkage of the octahedra in contrast to the Jahn-Teller-type asymmetric distortion. A double perovskite ferrimagnet, La2CoIrO6 bears inherently the charge disproportionation in the cationic sites with Co(2+ )and Ir4+ sublattices. In light of seeking the clues for the CBD and its coupling to the magnetic order, the crystal structure and magnetic structure of La2CoIrO6 were examined at various temperatures by using neutron diffraction. Structure refinements and mode decomposition analyses revealed that, indeed, a CBD mode exists substantially in La2CoIrO6 while preserving the symmetry of the lattices (P2(1)/n) and the magnetism [Gamma(1)(A(g))]. And more importantly, the magnitude of the symmetric distortion is correlated strongly with the size of the magnetic moment at temperatures below the Curie temperature (similar to 95 K). This strongly suggests a magnetoelastic coupling of the CBD mode. The order parameters for CBD, e.g., the movement of O1 toward Ir ions at low temperatures, are found to be in a linear-quadratic relationship with the value of the magnetic moment (similar to 0.002 angstrom/mu(2)(B) M-Co(2)), manifesting the magnetoelastic CBD in double perovskite."
"When applying learning to rank algorithms in real search applications, noise in human labeled training data becomes an inevitable problem which will affect the performance of the algorithms. Previous work mainly focused on studying how noise affects ranking algorithms and how to design robust ranking algorithms. In our work, we investigate what inherent characteristics make training data robust to label noise and how to utilize them to guide labeling. The motivation of our work comes from an interesting observation that a same ranking algorithm may show very different sensitivities to label noise over different data sets. We thus investigate the underlying reason for this observation based on three typical kinds of learning to rank algorithms (i.e. pointwise, pairwise and listwise methods) and three public data sets (i.e. OHSUMED, TD2003 and MSLR-WEB10K) with different properties. We find that when label noise increases in training data, it is the document pair noise ratio (referred to as pNoise) rather than document noise ratio (referred to as dNoise) that can well explain the performance degradation of a ranking algorithm. We further identify two inherent characteristics of the training data, namely relevance levels and label balance, that have great impact on the variation of pNoise with respect to label noise (i.e. dNoise). According to these above results, we further discuss some guidelines on the labeling strategy to construct robust training data for learning to rank algorithms in practice."
"A characterization study was done to analyze how microstructural regions affect the mechanical properties, corrosion and fractography of the Heat Affected Zone (HAZ), weld bead and base metal for pipe naturally aged for 21 years at 30 degrees C. Results showed that microstructures exhibited damage and consequently decrease in properties, resulting in over-aged due to service. SEM analysis showed that base metal presented coarse ferrite grain. Tensile test indicated that microstructures showed discontinuous yield. Higher tensile strength was obtained for weld bead, which exhibited a lower impact energy in comparison to that of HAZ and base metal associated with brittle fracture by trans-granular cleavage. The degradation of properties was associated with the coarsening of nano-carbides observed through TEM images analysis, which was confirmed by SEM fractography of tensile and impact fracture surfaces. The weld bead reached the largest void density and highest susceptibility to corrosion in H2S media when compared to those of the HAZ and base metal."
"Residual kidney function (RKF) contributes significant solute clearance in hemodialysis patients. Kidney Diseases Outcomes Quality Initiative (KDOQI) guidelines suggest that hemodialysis dose can be safely reduced in those with residual urea clearance (KRU) of 2 ml/min/1.73 m(2) or more. However, serial measurement of RKF is cumbersome and requires regular interdialytic urine collections. Simpler methods for assessing RKF are needed. beta-trace protein ((beta TP) and beta 2-microglobulin (beta 2M) have been proposed as alternative markers of RKF. We derived predictive equations to estimate glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and KRU based on serum beta TP and beta 2M from 191 hemodialysis patients based on standard measurements of KRU and GFR (mean of urea and creatinine clearances) using interdialytic urine collections. These modeled equations were tested in a separate validation cohort of 40 patients. A prediction equation for GFR that includes both beta TP and beta 2M provided a better estimate than either alone and contained the terms 1/beta TP, 1/beta 2M, 1/serum creatinine, and a factor for gender. The equation for KRU contained the terms 1/beta TP, 1/beta 2M, and a factor for ethnicity. Mean bias between predicted and measured GFR was 0.63 ml/min and 0.50 ml/min for KRU. There was substantial agreement between predicted and measured KRU at a cut-off level of 2 ml/min/1.73 m(2). Thus, equations involving beta TP and beta 2M provide reasonable estimates of RKF and could potentially be used to identify those with KRU of 2 ml/min/1.73 m2 or more to follow the KDOQI incremental hemodialysis algorithm.

"This paper presents the results of a detailed study of a complex hydrofracture system and host diamictons exposed within a longitudinal section through an elongate drumlin located to the west of Cemlyn Bay, Anglesey, NW Wales. This complex, laterally extensive sand, silt and clay filled hydrofracture system was active over a prolonged period and is thought to have developed beneath the Late Devensian (Weichselian) Irish Sea Ice Stream as it overrode this part of NW Anglesey. The sediment-fill to the hydrofracture system is deformed with kinematic indicators (folds, thrusts, augen) recording a SW-directed sense of shear, consistent with the regional ice flow direction across this part of the island. The lack of any geomorphological evidence for active retreat of the Irish Sea ice across Anglesey has led to the conclusion that hydrofracturing at the Cemlyn Bay site occurred within the bed of the Irish Sea Ice Stream whilst this relatively faster flowing corridor of ice was actively overriding the island. Shear imposed by the overriding ice led to the development of a subglacial shear zone which facilitated the propagation of the hydrofracture system with the laterally extensive feeder sills occurring parallel to Y-type Riedel shears. Although a subglacial setting beneath the active Irish Sea Ice Stream can be argued for the Cemlyn Bay hydrofracture system, its relationship to the formation of the 'host' drumlin remains uncertain. However, evidence presented here suggests that hydrofracturing may have occurred during the later stages or post landform development in response to the migration of overpressurised meltwater within the bed of the Irish Sea ice; possibly accompanying the local thinning and shutdown of the Irish Sea Ice Stream on Anglesey.

"Two types of non-metallic inclusion stringers were found in so-called upending hook nuts, in the vicinity of an indication on the bore wall's surface, first, manganese sulfides that can be expected in this material, and second, endogeneous oxidic inclusions from the steelmaking process. The latter ones, too, can be expected to an extend in the structural steel that was used to make the hook nuts from. However, they are present in an excessive amount and were causative for the decohesions that produced the reported MT indications. The forging process which was employed to produce the semifinished product used to machine the hook nuts from was unable to fragment and disperse the non-metallic inclusions sufficiently as is usually the case."
"A coupled 2D mathematical modelling study of landslide dam failure and flood is presented, complementing our experimental investigation presented in the companion paper. The model is built upon the shallow water hydrodynamic equations. The governing equations are numerically solved using the total-variation-diminishing version of the second-order weighted-average-flux method along with the HLLC (Harten, Lax and van Leer with Contact wave restored) approximate Riemann solver. Two parameters related to bed-load sediment transport and critical slope stability are calibrated using the measured stage hydrographs from two runs of the flume experiments. The calibrated model is then applied to other independent runs of the experiments featuring different inflow discharges, dam geometry, dam composition and initial breach dimensions. It is found to be able to satisfactorily reproduce the measured stage hydrographs and the widening of initial breach. The experimental observation of the prime role of the inflow discharge and initial breach in dictating the dam failure process and flood is unequivocally resolved, along with the impacts of dam geometry as well the content of cohesive clay and gravel in the dam. Interestingly, the downstream peak discharge and stage of the flood are substantially reduced by initial breach, which clearly exemplifies its role in modulating the flooding."
"Chiral beta-ketoesters bearing fully substituted carbon centers are important building blocks in organic synthesis. Mono-substituted ketoesters have been widely used to synthesize the above compounds through asymmetric additions or substitutions. The limitations of these protocols mainly exist in the substrate scopes, and alpha-methyl or alpha-fluoro-substituted beta-ketoesters or acetyl acetates are frequently used owing to their relatively higher reactivity. To break through this limitation, we employed N-heterocyclic carbene-catalyzed kinetic resolution to achieve the access to enantioenriched beta-ketoesters with quaternary stereocenters. Sterically more bulky groups such as benzyl, allyl, phenyl and cyclopropyl groups are all tolerated using this method."
"Characterization of states, the essential components of the underlying energy landscapes, is one of the most intriguing subjects in single-molecule (SM) experiments due to the existence of noise inherent to the measurements. Here we present a method to extract the underlying state sequences from experimental SM time-series. Taking into account empirical error and the finite sampling of the time-series, the method extracts a steady-state network which provides an approximation of the underlying effective free energy landscape. The core of the method is the application of rate-distortion theory from information theory, allowing the individual data points to be assigned to multiple states simultaneously. We demonstrate the method's proficiency in its application to simulated trajectories as well as to experimental SM fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) trajectories obtained from isolated agonist binding domains of the AMPA receptor, an ionotropic glutamate receptor that is prevalent in the central nervous system."
"Soot volume fractions and soot temperatures have been measured for the first time on candle flames. Measurements on laminar steady flames were carried out using candles with wick diameters of 2, 3 and 4 mm. Wick length was varied between 4 and 10 mm. The shape of the candle flame was obtained from CH* spontaneous emissions. Measured flame heights show an increase with wick dimensions, approaching an asymptotic value for increasing wick lengths. Soot volume fractions were obtained from laser extinction measurements with the Modulated Absorption/Emission (MAE) technique. A deconvolution technique and a regularization procedure were applied to the data. Radial profiles of soot volume fractions increase when varying the wick dimensions; this effect is produced by the greater amount of fuel released by the wick. Radially integrated soot volume fractions were also calculated, presenting a similar behavior to the soot volume fraction radial profiles. The peak integrated soot volume fraction was found at approximately half the flame height, independent of the wick dimensions and burning rates. Soot temperature was obtained from emission measurements at two different wavelengths considering the attenuation of the soot particles in the optical path length. A deconvolution and regularization procedure was carried out in order to obtain temperature profiles for different heights in the flame. The observed increase in soot production and soot temperature profiles was directly related to the higher burning rate experienced by the candle. The results show that peak integrated soot volume fractions are proportional to both the mass loss rates and the flame heights. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved."
"Updated imaging and photometric results from Chandra observations of SN 1987A, covering the last 16 years, are presented. We find that the 0.5-2 keV light curve has remained constant at similar to 8 x 10(-12) erg s(-1) cm(-2) since 9500 days, with the 3-8 keV light curve continuing to increase until at least 10,000 days. The expansion rate of the ring is found to be energy dependent, such that after day 6000 the ring expands faster in the 2-10 keV band than it does at energies <2 keV. Images show a reversal of the east-west asymmetry between 7000 and 8000 days after the explosion. The latest images suggest the southeastern side of the equatorial ring (ER) is beginning to fade. Consistent with the latest optical and infrared results, our Chandra analysis indicates the blast wave is now leaving the dense ER, which marks the beginning of a major change in the evolutionary phase of the supernova remnant 1987A."
"Background: Metastasis is the main cause for gastric cancer (GC)-related deaths. Better understanding of GC metastatic mechanism would provide novel diagnostic markers and therapeutic targets. Though it has been reported that mammalian sterile-20-like kinase 4 (MST4) exerts the oncogenic role in other tumors, the prognostic value and biological role of MST4 in GC are still unknown. Methods: The expression level of MST4 in GC was analyzed by using TCGA database. Then, Western blot and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) were used to determine the MST4 expression in GC tissues and cell lines Immunohistochemistry was performed to investigate the expression of proteins in human GC tissues, and its correlation with clinicopathologic parameters as well as the prognosis for patients with GC was analyzed. In addition, the biological function and its molecular mechanism of MST4 in GC were investigated by in vitro and in vivo assays. Results: It demonstrated that MST4 expression was significantly upregulated in GC tissues and cell lines. High expression of MST4 was correlated with aggressive clinicopathological parameters such as lymph node metastasis, lymphovascular invasion (all P < 0.05). GC patients with high MST4 expression had both shorter overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) than those with low MST4 expression (all P < 0.05). MST4 expression was an independent and significant risk factor for OS and DFS of GC patients (all P < 0.05). Results of functional experiments showed that MST4 could promote GC cells migration, invasion in vitro and metastasis in vivo. In terms of mechanism, MST4 promoted metastasis by facilitating epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) through activating Ezrin pathway in GC. Further studies indicate that down-regulated miR-124-3p expression contributes to upregulated MST4 expression in GC. Conclusion: Our data showed that MST4 predicts poor prognosis and promotes metastasis by facilitating epithelial-mesenchymal transition in GC. Therefore, our study suggests that MST4 can be used as a valuable prognostic biomarker and a potential therapeutic target in GC."
"Circannual rhythms regulate seasonal reproduction in many vertebrates. The present study investigated whether circannual reproductive phenotypes (rhythms in growth of gonads and molt) were generated independently of the circadian clocks in the subtropical non-photoperiodic spotted munia (Lonchura punctulata). Birds were subjected to light: dark (LD) cycles with identical light but varying dark hours, such that the period of LD cycle (T) equaled 16 h (T16; 12 h L: 4 h D), 21 h (T21; 12 h L: 9 h D), 24 h (T24; 12 h L: 12 h D) and 27 h (T27; 12 h L: 15 h D), or to continuous light (LL, 24 h L: 0 h D) at similar to 18 degrees C. During the similar to 21 month exposure, munia underwent at least two cycles of gonadal development and molt; changes in body mass were not rhythmic. This was similar to the occurrence of annual cycles in reproduction and molt observed in wild birds. A greater asynchrony between circannual cycles of gonad development and molt indicated their independent regulation. Females showed reproductive rhythms with similar circannual periods, whilst in males, circannual periods measured between peak gonadal size were longer in T21 and T24 than in T16 or T27. This suggested a sex-dependent timing of annual reproduction in the spotted munia. Also, food availability periods may not influence the circannual timing of reproduction, as shown by the results on the rhythm in gonadal growth and regression in munia under T-photocycles and LL that provided differential light (feeding) hours. Further, a short-term experiment revealed that activity-rest patterns in munia were synchronized with T-photocycles, but were arrhythmic under LL. We conclude that circadian rhythms are not involved in the timing of the annual reproductive cycle in the spotted munia."
"We report on simultaneous observations of the magnetar SGR J1745-2900 at frequencies nu = 2.54-225 GHz using the Nancay 94-m equivalent, Effelsberg 100-m, and IRAM 30-m radio telescopes. We detect SGR J1745-2900 up to 225 GHz, the highest radio frequency detection of pulsed emission from a neutron star to date. Strong single pulses are also observed from 4.85 up to 154 GHz. At the millimetre band we see significant flux density and spectral index variabilities on time scales of tens of minutes, plus variability between days at all frequencies. Additionally, SGR J1745-2900 was observed at a different epoch at frequencies nu = 296-472 GHz using the APEX 12-m radio telescope, with no detections. Over the period MJD56859.83 - 56862.93 the fitted spectrum yields a spectral index of <alpha > = -0.4 +/- 0.1 for a reference flux density < S-154 > = 1.1 +/- 0.2 mJy (with S-nu proportional to nu(alpha)), a flat spectrum alike those of the other radio-loud magnetars. These results show that strongly magnetized neutron stars can be effective radio emitters at frequencies notably higher to what was previously known and that pulsar searches in the Galactic Centre are possible in the millimetre band."
"Lithium-ion secondary cells are widely used for the space applications, today. Among these applications, REIMEI, which was launched in 2005, was one of the first satellites using lithium-ion battery. The off-the-shelf type cells designed using spinel manganese oxide for the positive and the graphitized carbon for the negative electrode were used. The cell case was made of aluminum laminated film and the structure was reinforced by the aluminum case filled with epoxy resin. Today, ten years has passed, and the battery experienced 55,000 cycles for charge and discharge. The current distribution between two batteries almost coincided together even after the long term operation, which revealed the stable performance of the lithium-ion secondary cells under the microgravity in space.

"Hemato-biochemical and histopathological alterations in mud loach (Misgurnus mizolepis) infected with Aeromonas sobria were characterized in the present study. Fish infected with 1 x 10(6) colony forming units/mL of A. sobria (25 fish x 3 replicates x 3 tanks) and uninfected (control) fish (25 fish x 3 replicates x 3 tanks) were kept in laboratory tanks with adequate water parameters, and euthanized at 1, 3, and 5 days post-infection (PI). Infected fish became lethargic and developed rapid opercular movements, pale gills, and cutaneous petechial hemorrhagesduring the 5-day experimental period. Hemato-biochemical parameters, namely hematocrit, hemoglobin, total protein, total calcium, alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity, and glucose level were significantly reduced, whereas urea (UA) level, and aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) activities were markedly increased in infected fish compared to control fish. Total leukocyte count was higher of infected than in control fish by day 3 PI, but dramatically decreased on day 5 PI. The leukogram showed the predominance of lymphocytes and neutrophils during the experimental period. Histologically, kidney and spleen showed extensive hemorrhage with cellular necrosis. Liver cells showed severely necrotic foci with karyopyknosis, karyorrhexis, karyolysis, and hyperchromatosis of the nuclear membrane. Thus, A. sobria infection causes hemato-biochemical changes such as anemia, hypoglycemia, hypoproteinemia, hypocalcemia, increased AST, ALT, and LDH activities, increased UA concentrations, and reduced ALP activity, and lead to compromised disease resistance, tissue damage, and low survival rates."
"The hexagonal layered compound, EuPtP, exhibits two valence transitions, at T-1 = 235 K and T-2 = 190 K, and an antiferromagnetic order at T-N = 8.6 K. We have examined the effects of magnetic field and pressure, and the specific heat. Analysis of the high-field experiments confirms that half of Eu are in a divalent state at the lowest temperature, and that the number of Eu2+ increases discontinuously at T-2 and T-1 with increasing temperature. The magnetic entropy reaches similar to 22 J K-1 mol(-1) at room temperature, which is larger than that expected for J = 7/2 of Eu2+ (17.3 J K-1 mol(-1)). This is in good agreement with the magnetic entropy deduced from the interconfigurational fluctuation model, which explains the valence transition in Eu(Pd1-xPtx)(2)Si-2. The application of pressure shifts T-1 and T-2 higher and suppresses the intermediate phase (beta phase, T-2 < T < T-1), whereas it does not change the properties of the low-temperature phase (gamma phase, T < T-2) and the T-N."
"Marine dinitrogen (N-2) fixation studies have focused nearly exclusively on cyanobacterial diazotrophs; however gamma-proteobacteria are an abundant component of the marine community and have been largely overlooked until recently. Here we present a phylogenetic analysis of all nifH gamma-proteobacterial sequences available in public databases and qPCR data of a gamma-proteobacterial phylotype, Gamma A (UMB), obtained during several research cruises. Our analysis revealed a complex diversity of diazotrophic gamma-proteobacteria. One phylotype in particular, Gamma A, was described in several traditional and quantitative PCR studies. Though several gamma-proteobacterial nifH sequences have been described as laboratory contaminants, Gamma A is part of a large cluster of sequences isolated from marine environments and distantly related to the clade of contaminants. Using a TaqMan probe and primer set, Gamma A nifH DNA abundance and expression were analyzed in nearly 1000 samples collected during 15 cruises to the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. The data showed that Gamma A is an active, cosmopolitan diazotroph found throughout oxygenated, oligotrophic waters reaching maximum abundances of 8 x 10(4) nifH DNA copies l(-1) and 5 x 10(5) nifH transcript copies l(-1). Gamma A nifH transcript abundances were on average 3 fold higher than nifH DNA abundances. The widespread distribution and activity of Gamma A indicate that it has potential to be a globally important N-2 fixing organism."
"It is quite common for the heating ventilating and air-conditioning (HVAC) systems of operating rooms (ORs) to operate at full-load condition even when they are not occupied. The objective of this study is to demonstrate the numerical analysis and field measurement approach on performance assessment of the HVAC system for an unoccupied OR. For energy-saving concern, preliminary study of numerical analysis has been conducted to evaluate the air velocity distribution and concentration contours while conducting the reducing air changes rate per hour (ACH) approach in the unoccupied OR at a district hospital. To validate the numerical simulation, field measurements of a full-scale OR have been carried out accordingly. Variable air volume (VAV) systems with reduced ACH scheme were introduced to examine the compromise between energy-saving potential and indoor environment parameters. The results demonstrate that it is feasible to realise satisfactory indoor environment by reducing the ACH with energy-efficient potential in the unoccupied OR."
"Background: Aldehyde dehydrogenase 1 (ALDH1) is widely used as a specific cancer stem cell marker in a variety of cancers, and may become a promising target for cancer therapy. However, the role of its expression in tumor cells and the microenvironment in different cancers is still controversial. Methods: To clarify the clinicopathological effect of ALDH1 expression in ovarian carcinoma, a series of 248 cases of paraffin-embedded formalin fixed ovarian carcinoma tissues with long term follow-up information were studied by immunohistochemistry. Results: The immunostaining of ALDH1 was variably detected in both tumor cells and the stromal cells, although the staining in tumor cells was not as strong as that in stromal cells. Statistical analyses showed that high ALDH1 expression in tumor cells was significantly associated with histological subtypes, early FIGO stage, well differentiation grade and better survival probability (p < 0.05). The expression of ALDH1 in the stromal cells had no clinicopathological associations in the present study (p > 0.05). Conclusioms: High expression of cancer stem cell marker ALDH1 in ovarian carcinoma cells may thus portend a favorable prognosis, but its expression in tumor microenvironment may have no role in tumor behavior of ovarian carcinomas. More studies are warranted to find out the mechanisms for this."
"Broadband ultrasonic spectra (100 kHz to 2 GHz) of aqueous solutions of liposomes from phospholipids without and with cholesterol or with a peptide added are analyzed near the main phase-transition temperatures of the bilayer systems. All spectra reveal a critical term due to domain structure fluctuations and up to three relaxation terms with discrete relaxation times. By analogy with critically demixing binary fluids, the former is evaluated within the framework of the Bhattacharjee-Ferrell dynamic scaling theory. The relaxation rates of fluctuations and the critical amplitudes resulting from this analysis are discussed briefly. Consistency with and differences to critically demixing systems are demonstrated. The terms with discrete relaxation times are related to short-scale liposome deformation, rotational diffusion of phospholipid molecules, and conformational isomerization of alkyl chains within the bilayers, respectively."
"Pathologic myocardial hypertrophy develops when the heart is chronically pressure-overloaded. Elevated intracellular cGMP-levels have been reported to prevent the development of pathologic myocardial hypertrophy, therefore we investigated the effects of chronic activation of the cGMP producing enzyme, soluble guanylate cyclase by Cinaciguat in a rat model of pressure overload-induced cardiac hypertrophy. Abdominal aortic banding (AAB) was used to evoke pressure overload-induced cardiac hypertrophy in male Wistar rats. Sham operated animals served as controls. Experimental and control groups were treated with 10 mg/kg/day Cinaciguat (Cin) or placebo (Co) p.o. for six weeks, respectively. Pathologic myocardial hypertrophy was present in the AABCo group following 6 weeks of pressure overload of the heart, evidenced by increased relative heart weight, average cardiomyocyte diameter, collagen content and apoptosis. Cinaciguat did not significantly alter blood pressure, but effectively attenuated all features of pathologic myocardial hypertrophy, and normalized functional changes, such as the increase in contractility following AAB. Our results demonstrate that chronic enhancement of cGMP signalling by pharmacological activation of sGC might be a novel therapeutic approach in the prevention of pathologic myocardial hypertrophy."
"The effect of Si addition and heat treatment on the Al-5wt.%Fe alloy has been investigated by OM, SEM-EDS and XRD. The results show that the Si plays a significant role in refining the primary Al3Fe phase. It was found that the addition of 3.0wt.% Si made the alloy present the finest and well-distributed primary Al3Fe phase, but the Al3Fe phase almost disappeared when 5wt.% Si was added. With further increase in the Si content, some Fe-rich phases appeared in the inter-grains and coarsened. In addition, the heat treatments exert a significant impact on the microstructural evolution of the Al-5wt.%Fe-5wt.%Si alloy. After heat treatment for 28 hours at 590 degrees C, the coarse platelet or blocky Fe-rich phase in Al-5wt.%Fe-5wt.%Si alloys was granulated; the phase transformation from metastable platelet Al3FeSi and blocky Al8Fe2Si to stable Al5FeSi had occurred. With the extension of heat treatment, the Si phase coarsened gradually."
"Objective: In this investigation, we reported the increase in emergency department and inpatient admission cases during the month of November 2012 post Hurricane Sandy as compared with baseline (November 2010, 2011, and 2013) for elderly patients aged 65 and up. Methods: Medical claims data for patients aged 65 and over treated at emergency department and inpatient health care facilities in New Jersey were analyzed to examine the surge in frequencies of diagnoses treated immediately following Hurricane Sandy. The differences were quantified using gap analysis for 2 years before and 1 year after the event. Results: There was an average increase of 1700 cases for the month of November 2012 relative to baseline for the top 15 most frequently diagnosed emergency department medical conditions. On a daily basis, a volume increase by an average 57 cases could be expected, including significant numbers of limb fractures and other trauma cases for these most frequently encountered medical conditions. Conclusions: Understanding the surge level in medical services needed in emergency departments and inpatient facilities during a natural disaster aftermath is critical for effective emergency preparation and response for the elderly population."
"Anaphylaxis is a rapid, systemic, often unanticipated, and potentially life-threatening immune reaction occurring after exposure to certain foreign substances. The main immunologic triggers include food, insect venom, and medications. Multiple immunologic pathways underlie anaphylaxis, but most involve immune activation and release of immunomodulators. Anaphylaxis can be difficult to recognize clinically, making differential diagnosis key. The incidence of anaphylaxis has at least doubled during the past few decades, and in the United States alone, an estimated 1500 fatalities are attributed to anaphylaxis annually. The increasing incidence and potentially life-threatening nature of anaphylaxis coupled with diagnostic challenges make appropriate and timely treatment critical. Epinephrine is universally recommended as the first-line therapy for anaphylaxis, and early treatment is critical to prevent a potentially fatal outcome. Despite the evidence and guideline recommendations supporting its use for anaphylaxis, epinephrine remains underused. Data indicate that antihistamines are more commonly used to treat patients with anaphylaxis. Although histamine is involved in anaphylaxis, treatment with antihistamines does not relieve or prevent all of the pathophysiological symptoms of anaphylaxis, including the more serious complications such as airway obstruction, hypotension, and shock. Additionally, antihistamines do not act as rapidly as epinephrine; maximal plasma concentrations are reached between 1 and 3 hours for antihistamines compared with, 10 minutes for intramuscular epinephrine injection. This demonstrates the need for improved approaches to educate physicians and patients regarding the appropriate treatment of anaphylaxis."
"Introduction. Streptococcus agalactiae is the most prevalent agent of invasive disease in the newborn (sepsis, pneumonia, and meningitis), as well as an important cause of puerperal fever, urinary tract infection and surgical site infection. The aim of our study was to know the evolution of macrolide and lincosamide resistance in this microorganism. Methods. Resistance phenotypes were established according to the erythromycin-clindamycin induction test: M (efflux pump) or MLSB (methylase). Genetic mechanisms were detected by PCR for the following genes: ermB, ermA, ermTR, and mefA/E. Molecular typing was based on chromosomal DNA macrorestriction and detection of fragments using pulsed-field gel electrophoresis. Results. During 8 years, 300 isolates of S. agalactiae were recovered. Seventy-eight (26%) were resistant to macrolides, and seventy (23%) were resistant to lincosamides. Constitutive MLSB was observed in 21% of the isolates (all but one carrying the ermB gene), with a erythromycin MIC90 >= 256 mg/L. Inducible MLSB was observed in 2.3% of the isolates (all carrying the ermTR gene), with a MIC90 of 6 mg/L. M phenotype was observed in 2.7% of the isolates (all carrying the mefA/E gene), with a MIC90 of 6 mg/L. Molecular typing revealed the presence of two major clones (A and B) comprising 56.6% of the isolates. Most of the isolates (90.5%) belonging to clon A carried the ermB gene. Conclusions. Macrolide resistance in our area is similar to that observed in the rest of Spain, but there has been no increase in the incidence rate along the study period."
"Longitudinal research has demonstrated that responsive parental behaviors reliably predict subsequent language gains in children with autism spectrum disorder. To investigate the underlying causal mechanisms, we conducted a randomized clinical trial of an experimental intervention (Focused Playtime Intervention, FPI) that aims to enhance responsive parental communication (N = 70). Results showed a significant treatment effect of FPI on responsive parental behaviors. Findings also revealed a conditional effect of FPI on children's expressive language outcomes at 12-month follow up, suggesting that children with baseline language skills below 12 months (n = 24) are most likely to benefit from FPI. Parents of children with more advanced language skills may require intervention strategies that go beyond FPI's focus on responsive communication."
"The upland cropping region of Northwest Cambodia exhibits limited crop diversity, with maize and cassava dominating rain-fed production systems. Farmers in the Districts of Sala Krau in Pailin Province, and Samlout in Battambang Province, report soil fertility decline in upland cropping systems with associated reduced yields and profitability compared with five years ago. Research was conducted at one site in each of these Districts over a two year period. The purpose of the study was to investigate crop rotations in this system with a focus on better use of soil water throughout the year to increase crop yields and profitability. This included an experiment to investigate increasing cropping intensity from the usual two crops per year to three and evaluate which crop sequences would be feasible. Out of a total 15 crop sequences evaluated, only four were successful in producing viable grain yields. These were the same sequences at both sites and included maize-maize-fallow, maize-maize-sunflower, maize-soybean-fallow and maize soybean-sunflower. At Pailin, the sequence with the highest overall mean yield (4.3 t/ha) and profit was maize-maize-sunflower which returned a gross margin of $USD3700/ha over two years. The sequences with a fallow instead of a third crop produced the lowest financial returns at Pailin. However, in Samlout the maize-fallow was the most profitable sequence with an overall mean yield of 3.0 t/ha, returning $1680/ha over two years. The least profitable sequences at Samlout were the two soybean sequences. This study was successful in growing five crops in two years at Pailin, but could not reach the goal of six due to cultivar maturity length. At Samlout four crops over two years were produced, as the pre-monsoon crop was not planted in either year due to lack of sowing rainfall. Seasonal climatic factors had the greatest effect at both field sites on gross margins, which emphasized the importance of matching sowing date to rainfall to make better use of stored soil moisture to optimise yield and profitability. At Pailin, mean seasonal surface soil moisture, hundred seed weight and harvest index also impacted gross margin returns. This research validated the stability of maize in the farming system while sunflower should be further investigated in cropping sequences. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."
"Potato callus has been shown to be capable of de novo organized development including shoot and root formation. A surprising finding in a study of potato (Solanum tuberosum cv. Iwa) callus culture initiated from leaf explants on a medium supplemented with auxin and cytokinin is reported here. Five weeks after callus formation, a low frequency (about 10%) of the callus cultures had formed microtubers. The microtubers initially appeared to be light green and some were elongated. One week later the microtubers had lost much of the green appearance and were full of hairs on the side and with many scattered dark brown spots on the top view. Histological analysis showed that a microtuber was connected with the callus and not with the leaf explant as the callus typically lacked the internal organization of a leaf. This is the first report of the occurrence of microtubers in potato callus cultures."
"A series of five children with delayed presentation of congenital pulmonary airway malformation (CPAM), all initially misdiagnosed as pulmonary tuberculosis, is described. All five children presented with recurrent respiratory infections and failure to thrive, having shown poor response to multiple antibiotics course, including anti-tubercular therapy for variable periods. Successful surgical intervention was belatedly instigated."
"Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), which is caused by mutations in the X-linked dystrophin gene, is a severe and progressive neuromuscular disease with no available cure. By integrating 2 microarray datasets from the Gene Expression Omnibus, we identified differentially expressed genes in 2 stages of DMD and systematically explored their potential disease-related mechanisms using a network view. Twenty differentially expressed genes were detected in various stages of DMD. According to the network with dystrophin as its center, none of the 20 proteins interacts with dystrophin directly. IQ motif-containing GTPase-activating protein 1 was found in the 2nd-level neighbors with a degree of 21. Microtubule-associated protein tau, membrane metallo-endopeptidase, interleukin 13 receptor alpha 1, and multiple epidermal growth factor-like domains 6 were found in the 3rd-level neighbors. These identifications require further investigation, as this report is the first of possible associations between DMD and these proteins. Analysis of differentially expressed genes through this network view may provide important information for further exploration of underlying mechanisms of DMD."
"Avocado (Persea americana Mill.) is a high-value fruit that continues to increase in consumer demand. A population of 'Hass'-'Bacon' hybrids was planted at USDA-ARS, Fort Pierce, as part of a study to find selections with good horticultural and postharvest quality traits for Florida. Extensive phenotypic data on quality were collected over 3 years. Ten selections were identified in 2014 and 2015 with promising fruit quality and postharvest shelf life characteristics and were tested in sensory panels using store-bought 'Hass' as the standard. In general, the selections had fruit quality similar to commercial 'Hass'. Avocados that were most liked were described as creamy in texture with buttery and nutty flavor. Only one selection (R7T54 in 2014) and one store-bought control ('Hass' in 2015) were disliked, which was associated with greater firmness at the time of evaluation, likely relating to insufficient postharvest conditioning. Furthermore, CA 'Hass' commercial requirements for minimum dry matter (20.8%) were generally achieved by these selections under Florida conditions, ranging from 18.4% to 25.7%. This study identified 10 selections with composition and sensory quality similar to 'Hass' that are suitable for further testing and development in Florida."
"Urbanisation can be dangerous to biological diversity, but on the other hand cities can enhance local and regional biodiversity by providing habitat analogues for many - sometimes endangered - species that are elsewhere excluded from natural habitats. Sand lizards (Lacerta agilis) are endangered in Germany and populations are declining. This species may colonise urban habitats to a certain degree, but the effects of urban development or urbanisation on their distribution and population densities remain unexplained. The aim of this study was to ascertain if the metropolitan area of Berlin offers secondary habitats for sand lizard populations, which environmental factors affect colonisation success and to what degree they tolerate human impacts. In 2012, sand lizard populations in 30 plots (ten urban, ten suburban, ten rural) were assessed regarding their conservation status and environmental variables. We found 15 sand lizard populations; statistical analyses showed no significant differences in individual numbers among the three urbanisation categories. Regression models revealed that the percentage of suitable nesting sites, basking places and suitable microhabitats had a positive effect on density while individual numbers responded negatively to pets and isolation. Urbanisation neither affected sand lizard population densities nor their conservation status, and optimal habitats appeared independent of urbanisation. Urban as well as metropolitan habitats can therefore serve as refuges for this endangered species and negative impacts can be mitigated by forward-looking management, which is characterised by only minimal interventions."
"Biaxially textured GdBa2Cu3O7-z (GdBCO) films with T-c above 93 K have been prepared on (001) LaAlO3 substrate by self-developed non-fluorine polymer-assisted chemical solution deposition (PA-CSD) approach. The GdBCO films show smooth and crack-free morphology. Many nanoscale particles with homogeneous distribution are observed in the GdBCO films, which have not been observed yet in the YBa2Cu3O7-z, (YBCO) films prepared by the same processing technique. Besides a high J(c) (77 K. 0 T) of 2.28 MA/cm(2), the optimized GdBCO films show a better J(c)-B behavior and an improved high-field J(c) compared to the YBCO films. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

"Many studies have been performed to evaluate the effects of sink demand on photosynthesis using artificial defruiting experiments. However, information is scarce regarding photosynthesis changes in field citrus trees with naturally varying sink demands. In this study, we compared photosynthesis in three types of shoots of 'Newhall' navel oranges (Citrus sinensis Osbeck), including no fruit bearing shoots, one-fruit bearing shoots and two-fruit bearing shoots, in field conditions. The results showed that the highest sink demand of shoots corresponded to the lowest net photosynthetic rate (Pn). The determination of stomatal conductance (Gs), substomatal CO2 concentration (Ci) and transpiration rate (E) suggested that the Gs and E were not significantly different between these three types of shoots, while the Ci increased as the sink demand increased. Further analysis of leaf morphology features and nutrient status showed that the higher fruit load shoots had smaller leaf area, length, width, thickness and dry weight, and also lower concentrations of nitrogen, phosphorous and potassium. The quality comparison of fruits on one-fruit bearing shoots and two-fruit bearing shoots suggested that there was no difference in internal quality such as total soluble solids (TSS), titratable acidity (TA) and the TSS/TA ratio except for some external features. Overall, our data indicated that the reduction of Pn with sink demand increasing was mainly caused by limited development and a lower nutritional supply in source leaves. This limitation may be derived from competition between fruit and adjacent leaves under a high fruit load. This finding provides new insights into sink demand effects on photosynthesis in field conditions and useful guidance for citrus orchard management practices. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

"This paper describes an experimental investigation into the compressive strength, the flexural strength and the water resistance of magnesium phosphate cement (MPC) mortar reinforced by glass fiber. Fiber volume fractions of 1.5%, 2.5%, 3%, 3.5% and binder/aggregate ratios of 1:1, 1:1.2 and 1:1.5 were designed for the experiments. The microstructural, mechanical and water resistance properties of fiber-reinforced MPCs were evaluated with respects to the variance in the fiber volume fraction, the ratio of binder/aggregate. The results showed that the glass fibers have more pronounced effects on the flexural strength compared to compressive strength. The optimum volume fraction of glass fiber is reported at 2.5%. Furthermore, the effect of glass fiber on the water resistance of MPC is discussed, and a ""reserving"" method to resist the strength loss by water has been proposed. In addition, the paper provides a possible explanation of the fiber reinforcement mechanism which is in agreement with the experimental results. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."
"Objective: To present the preliminary results of new malleus replacement prosthesis combined with a total ossicular prosthesis in middle ear reconstruction in patients missing the malleus and stapes. Study Design: Prospective experimental and nonrandomized clinical study. Setting: Tertiary referral center. Methods: An original titanium malleus replacement prosthesis (MRP) was designed to be inserted into the external auditory canal and to replace a missing malleus for various middle ear pathologies. The MRP was tested experimentally and clinically. The vibratory properties of the new prosthesis were measured using laser Doppler vibrometry. Ninety patients with missing malleus and stapes, undergoing 92 ossicular reconstructions were enrolled in this study from September 1994 to March 2012. Comparative analyses were made between a group of 34 cases of ossicular reconstructions with total prosthesis (TORP) positioned from the tympanic membrane to the stapes footplate (TM-to-footplate assembly) and a group of 58 cases of ossicular reconstructions with TORP positioned from a newly designed malleus replacement prosthesis (MRP) to the stapes footplate (MRP-to-footplate assembly). Preoperative and postoperative audiometric evaluation using conventional audiometry, that is, air-bone gap (ABG), bone-conduction thresholds (BC), and air-conduction thresholds (AC) were assessed. Results: Experimentally, the vibratory properties of the MRP are promising and remain very good even when the MRP is cemented into the bony canal wall mimicking its complete osseous-integration, if this were to occur. This finding supports the short-term clinical results as in the TM-to-footplate group; the 3-month postoperative mean ABG was 23.3 dB compared with 12.5 dB in the MRP-to-footplate group (difference, 10.8; 95% confidence interval, 4.0-17.6); 37.0% of patients from the TM-to-footplate group had a postoperative ABG of 10 dB or less, and 48.1% of patients had a postoperative ABG of 20 dB or less, as compared with 58.1% and 79.1%, respectively, in the MRP-to-footplate group. The average gain in AC was 11.0 dB in the TM-to-footplate group as compared with 21.3 dB in the MRP-to-footplate group (difference, -10.3; 95% confidence interval, -18.2 to -2.4). Conclusion: The results of this study indicate that superior postoperative hearing thresholds could be achieved using a MRP-to-footplate assembly, compared with a TM-to-footplate assembly in patients with an absent malleus undergoing ossiculoplasty. The postoperative AC thresholds, after 3 months and 1 year, are significantly lower in patients treated with the MRP-to-footplate assembly."
"Based on Cu2+-promoted hydrolysis reaction a rhodamine B derivative L containing a napthalene moiety has been synthesized as a fluorescence turn-on chemodosimetric probe for Cu2+ in EtOH:H2O (3:1, v/v, 10 mM HEPES Buffer, pH approximate to 7). The Ce2+ promoted ring opening and hydrolysis reaction of L leads to formation of the 2:1 ligand metal intermediate complex which rapidly converts to rhodamine-B and bis-Cu2+ complex of 1, 8 diaminonaphthalene. The proposed sensing mechanism has been supported by ESI-MS, H-1 NMR, C-13 NMR, IR analysis and DFT calculations. The dye L exhibits high selectivity toward Cu2+ over other relevant metal ions and anions in the physiological pH range 5-8 with a low detection limit of 60 nM. Application in confocal cell imaging in HeLa cells is also demonstrated in the current work. Additionally, L has been shown to be non-toxic and biocompatible for mammalian cells.

"Several reports have indicated that low level of polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) exposure can adversely affect a multitude of physiological disorders and diseases in in vitro, in vivo, and as reported in epidemiological studies. This investigation is focused on the possible contribution of two most prevalent PCB congeners in vitro in developing toxicities. We used PCBs 138 and 153 at the human equivalence level as model agents to test their specificity in developing toxicities. We chose a global approach using oligonucleotide microarray technology to investigate modulated gene expression for biological effects, upon exposure of PCBs, followed by Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA), to understand the underlying consequence in developing disease and disorders. We performed in vitro studies with human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC), where PBMC cells were exposed to respective PCBs for 48 h. Overall, our observation on gene expression indicated that PCB produces a unique signature affecting different pathways, specific for each congener. While analyzing these data through IPA, the prominent and interesting disease and disorders were neurological disease, cancer, cardiovascular disease, respiratory disease, as well as endocrine system disorders, genetic disorders, and reproductive system disease. They showed strong resemblances with in vitro, in vivo, and in the epidemiological studies. A distinct difference was observed in renal and urological diseases, organisimal injury and abnormalities, dental disease, ophthalmic disease, and psychological disorders, which are only revealed by PCB 138 exposure, but not in PCB 153. The present study emphasizes the challenges of global gene expression in vitro and was correlated with the results of exposed human population. The microarray results give a molecular mechanistic insight and functional effects, following PCB exposure. The extent of changes in genes related to several possible mode(s) of action highlights the changes in cellular functions and signaling pathways that play major roles. In addition to understanding the pathways related to mode of action for chemicals, these data could lead to the identification of genomic signatures that could be used for screening of chemicals for their potential to cause disease and developmental disorders.

"Lanthanum oxide (La2O3) was incorporated as a catalytic synergist to enhance the flame retardancy of the environmental friendly halogen free inorganic compound magnesium hydroxide (MH), the main flame retardant, filled in the flammable polymer polypropylene (PP) matrix. It was found that the addition of an appropriate loading of La2O3 could remarkably improve the flame retardancy of MH filled PP FR composite. The significant enhancement in the flame retardancy was attributed to the greatly improved quality of the condensed phase charred layers deposited on the surface of the formed magnesium oxide (MgO) particles through participation of PP macromolecular chains themselves in the char formation reaction under the catalytic action of La2O3. It was believed that the char formation reaction involved with the PP macromolecular chains is composed of two processes related to the catalytic role of La2O3, i.e. catalytic oxidation hydrogenation and catalytic partial oxidation.

"How can recent findings indicating that perspective-taking fosters negative behavior and defensiveness be reconciled with ample evidence that perspective-taking can have beneficial effects on individuals' evaluative and behavioral reactions to other people? I argue that perspective-taking tends to prompt positive reactions in contexts where the potential for evaluation by the target is low and where individuals thus focus their attention squarely on understanding the target when perspective-taking. In contrast, perspective-taking prompts more negative reactions in contexts where the potential for evaluation by the target is high and where individuals thus focus their attention back on themselves when perspective-taking. I further argue that the relevance of individuals' concerns about their social standing with others moderates perspective-taking effects because it determines which of two distinct forms of egocentrism arises. A beneficial form involves individuals projecting themselves onto the target, whereas a detrimental form involves individuals becoming preoccupied with the target's evaluation of them. I also maintain that perspective-taking is more likely to foster favorable treatment of targets when it is easy for individuals to identify what constitutes positive versus negative treatment. Because most experiments examining perspective-taking have been conducted in contexts involving low potential for evaluation and clear behavior response options, which may not be representative of the contexts in which individuals most often engage in perspective-taking in their everyday lives, negative effects might be more common than traditionally believed. I review the research literature and find general support for this conceptual framework. Apparent counter-examples and directions for future research are discussed."
"A series of microcatenas on the slopes of sinkholes were studied on the western macroslope of the southern Urals in the Shulgan-Tash Reserve. The morphological, chemical, physical, and physicochemical characteristics of the soils were analyzed. In order to reveal their regional specificity, the soils of the sinkholes under broadleaved forests in the southern Urals were compared with analogous soils under the northern taiga of the Belomorsk-Kuloi Plateau. It was shown that the full-profile vertically differentiated soils in the upper parts of the microcatenas are replaced by weakly developed and slightly differentiated soils in the lower parts of the microcatenas crossing sinkholes of different diameters in both natural zones."
"Recent advances in molecular biotechnology have introduced an array of powerful techniques for studying the microbial ecology of beverage and food fermentations. Molecular tools such as denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis, terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism, fluorescent in situ hybridization, clone libraries, and quantitative polymerase chain reaction are sensitive methods for microbial community analysis and have several advantages over traditional, culture-based techniques. Some of these tools have far-reaching benefits, not only for fermentation research but also for rapid quality-assurance applications in the beverage fermentation industry. Additionally, the increasing accessibility of next-generation sequencing technologies, such as Illumina and 454 Life Sciences sequencing platforms, is bringing some of these powerful new tools within reach of researchers for food or fermentation analysis. This promises high-resolution studies revealing deep community structure in fermentation and processing environments, endeavors with obvious benefits to understanding and controlling mixed microbial fermentation systems and process hygiene. This review presents an overview of the current technologies available for microbial community analysis and considers their specific application for fermentation research and industrial purposes, as well as providing an outlook on the future of community profiling in beer and wine."
"Amphiphilic zinc porphyrin (P-zn; electron donor, D)-fullerene (C-60; electron acceptor, A) dyads 2 nand 3, bearing an identical hydrophilic wedge with triethylene glycol chains but different linkers between the P-Zn and C-60 units, self-assemble into nanotubes with essentially different dimensional and geometrical features from one another. The nanotube from dyad 2 with an ester linker consists of a bilayer wall formed with coaxially segregated D and A nanodomains along the tube axis (coaxial D-A heterojunction), thereby displaying explicit photoconductivity with ambipolar carrier transport properties. In contrast, the nanotube from dyad 3 with a rigid arylacetylene linker consists of a monolayer wall with an alternate geometry of D/A stacking, resulting in poor photoconducting outputs. Such a geometrical difference also significantly affects the photovoltaic properties."
"While global maternal mortality has decreased in the last 25 years, the maternal mortality ratio in the United States has actually increased. Maternal mortality is a complex phenomenon involving multifaceted socioeconomic and clinical parameters including inequalities in access to health care, racial and ethnic disparities, maternal comorbidities, and epidemiologic ascertainment bias. Escalating maternal mortality underscores the importance of clinician preparedness to respond to maternal cardiac arrest that may occur in any maternal health care setting. Management of maternal cardiac arrest requires an interdisciplinary team familiar with the physiologic changes of pregnancy and the maternal resuscitation algorithm. Interventions intended to mitigate obstacles such as aortocaval compression, which may undermine the success of resuscitation interventions, must be performed concurrent to standard basic and advanced cardiac life support maneuvers. High-quality chest compressions and oxygenation must be performed along with manual left lateral uterine displacement when the uterine size is similar to 20 weeks. While deciphering the etiology of maternal cardiac arrest, diagnoses unique to pregnancy and those of the nonpregnant state should be considered at the same time. If initial basic life support and advanced cardiac life support interventions fail to restore maternal circulation within 4 minutes of cardiac arrest, perimortem delivery is advised provided the uterus is similar to 20 weeks' size. Preparations for perimortem delivery are best anticipated by the resuscitation team for the procedure to be executed opportunely. Following delivery, intraabdominal examination may reveal a vascular catastrophe, hematoma, or both. If return of spontaneous circulation has not been achieved, additional interventions may include cardiopulmonary bypass and/or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. Simulation and team training enhance institution readiness for maternal cardiac arrest. Knowledge gaps are significant in the science of maternal resuscitation. Further research is required to fully optimize: relief of aortocaval compression during the resuscitation process, gestational age and timing of perimortem delivery, and other interventions that deviate from nonpregnant standard resuscitation protocol to achieve successful maternal resuscitation. A robust detailed national and international prospective database was recommended by the International Liaison Committee on Resuscitation in 2015 to facilitate further research unique to cardiac arrest during pregnancy that will produce optimal resuscitation techniques for maternal cardiac arrest."
"Background Loss of 18q22.3 is a prognostic marker in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). This study investigated genes encoded by this cytoband. Methods We studied mRNA/protein expression in radically resected (n = 130) and metastatic patients (n = 50). The role of CYB5A was tested in 11 PDAC cell lines and five primary cultures through retrovirus-mediated upregulation and small interfering RNA using wound-healing, invasion, annexin-V, electron microscopy, and autophagic assays, as well as autophagy genes and kinases arrays. CYB5A+ orthotopic models (n = 6 mice/group) were monitored by Firefly and Gaussia-luciferase bioluminescence, magnetic resonance imaging, and high-frequency ultrasound. Data were analyzed by t test, Fisher exact-test, log-rank test and Cox proportional hazards models. All statistical tests were two-sided. Results Both resected and metastatic patients with low mRNA or protein expression of CYB5A had statistically significantly shorter survival (eg, median = 16.7 months, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 13.5 to 19.9; vs median = 24.8 months, 95% CI = 12.8 to 36.9; P = .02, two-sided log-rank test; n = 82 radically resected PDACs), and multivariable analyses confirmed prognostic relevance. Moreover, we characterized a novel function to CYB5A, autophagy induction, concomitant with reduced proliferation and migration/invasion of PDAC cells. Network analysis of proautophagic pathways suggested CYB5A interaction with TRAF6, which was confirmed by TRAF6 downregulation after CYB5A reconstitution (-69% in SU.86.86-CYB5A+; P = .005, two-sided t test). CYB5A silencing had opposite effects, restoring TRAF6 expression and wound healing. In vivo studies showed that CYB5A induced autophagy while inhibiting tumor growth/metastasis and increasing survival (median = 57 days, 95% CI = 52 to 61; vs median = 44 days, 95% CI = 21 to 57; P = .03, two-sided log-rank test). Conclusions These results define CYB5A as a novel prognostic factor for PDAC that exerts its tumor-suppressor function through autophagy induction and TRAF6 modulation."
"Offshore and inland river ship detection has been studied on both synthetic aperture radar (SAR) and optical remote sensing imagery. However, the classic ship detection methods based on SAR images can cause a high false alarm ratio and be influenced by the sea surface model, especially on inland rivers and in offshore areas. The classic detection methods based on optical images do not perform well on small and gathering ships. This paper adopts the idea of deep networks and presents a fast regional-based convolutional neural network (R-CNN) method to detect ships from high-resolution remote sensing imagery. First, we choose GaoFen-2 optical remote sensing images with a resolution of 1 m and preprocess the images with a support vector machine (SVM) to divide the large detection area into small regions of interest (ROI) that may contain ships. Then, we apply ship detection algorithms based on a region-based convolutional neural network (R-CNN) on ROI images. To improve the detection result of small and gathering ships, we adopt an effective target detection framework, Faster-RCNN, and improve the structure of its original convolutional neural network (CNN), VGG16, by using multiresolution convolutional features and performing ROI pooling on a larger feature map in a region proposal network (RPN). Finally, we compare the most effective classic ship detection method, the deformable part model (DPM), another two widely used target detection frameworks, the single shot multibox detector (SSD) and YOLOv2, the original VGG16-based Faster-RCNN, and our improved Faster-RCNN. Experimental results show that our improved Faster-RCNN method achieves a higher recall and accuracy for small ships and gathering ships. Therefore, it provides a very effective method for offshore and inland river ship detection based on high-resolution remote sensing imagery."
"Introduction: Hepatitis C virus (HCV) commonly causes a chronic infection but few of patients are able to clear the virus naturally. Interleukin-10 (IL-10) is an anti-inflammatory cytokine that can suppress the immune response against HCV. Interindividual variations in IL-10 production are genetically contributed by polymorphisms within the IL-10 promoter region. This study aimed to investigate the association of the IL-10 gene promoter -1082 G/A, -819 C/T, and -592 C/A polymorphisms with HCV infection susceptibility in Pakistani individuals. Methodology: Eighty-nine chronically infected patients and 99 controls were enrolled in the study. IL-10 (-1,082 G/A, -819 C/T, -592 C/A) genotyping was performed by amplification refractory mutation system-polymerase chain reaction (ARMS-PCR). Results: A suggestive evidence of association with hepatitis C was obtained for the IL-10 -819 C/T (-592 C/A) (p: 0.03) promoter polymorphism at the allele level but not in genotype distribution. The IL-10 -1082 allele showed no association while positive association of GG (p: 0.001) gene and negative association for GA (0.001) gene were observed. Higher frequencies were observed for GTA (p: 0.02), ACC (p: 0.01) haplotype and GCC/GTA (p: 0.005) diplotype in HCV patients than controls while diplotype GCC/ATA showed protective effect against HCV. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that different IL-10 gene polymorphisms may lead to an imbalance between the pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokine responses which may in turn influence the susceptibility to HCV infection."
"OBJECTIVE: To analyze geographic access to hospital childbirth in Brazilian municipalities. METHODS: Information on deaths and births were analyzed in regards to appropriateness for calculating the infant mortality rate during the period 2005 to 2007, for the 5,564 Brazilian municipalities. Indicators of supply and geographic access to health services were calculated to express hospital childbirth access. A multivariate regression model was used to test the association between geographic access to childbirth and the infant mortality rate in municipalities with adequate vital information. RESULTS: Of the municipalities analyzed, 56% had adequate vital information, corresponding to 72% of Brazil's population. The geographic distance between the municipality of residence and municipality of hospitalization was inversely associated to population size, per capita income and the infant mortality rate, even when controlling for demographic and socioeconomic factors. CONCLUSIONS: Although important strategies have been developed in Brazil to improve the quality of care for pregnant women, actions to guarantee equal access to childbirth services are still insufficient. Large geographic distance to childbirth facility was identified as a risk factor for infant mortality, together with unequal supply of quality health services and lack of integration with primary care."
"Objective: To present the perinatal findings and molecular cytogenetic characterization of prenatally detected mosaic r(21). Materials, Methods, and Results: A 29-year-old primigravid woman underwent amniocentesis at 22 weeks' gestation because of hyperechogenic cardiac foci and intrauterine growth restriction. Amniocentesis revealed a karyotype of 46,XY,r(21)[15]/45,XY,-21[5]. The parental karyotypes were normal. The woman requested repeat amniocentesis. Oligonucleotide-based array comparative genomic hybridization was applied to the uncultured amniocytes, rapidly detecting a 2.09-Mb deletion of 21q21.1-q21.2 (21,495,262-23,580,815 bp) and a 5.03-Mb deletion of 21q22.3-q22.3 (41,887,412-46,914,715 bp). Cytogenetic analysis revealed a karyotype of 46,XY,r(21)[8]/45,XY,-21[3]/46,XY,idic r(21)[1]. The pregnancy was terminated, and a malformed fetus was delivered with clinodactyly, short big toes, separation between the first and second toes, prominent nasal bridge, downward slanting palpebral fissures, protuberant occiput, prominent forehead, broad anteverted nasal tip, long philtrum, thin upper lip, small mouth, and micrognathia. The placenta had a karyotype of 46,XY,r(21)[83]/45,XY,-21[11]/46,XY,idic r(21)[6], and the cord blood lymphocytes had a karyotype of 46,XY,r(21)[88]/45,XY,-21[9]/46,XY,idic r(21)[3]. Polymorphic DNA marker analysis determined a maternal origin for the deletion. Conclusion: An extra interstitial 21q deletion can be associated with mosaic r(21) in addition to a terminal 21q deletion. aCGH is useful in determining the breakpoints and associated subtle structural abnormalities in cases of prenatally detected ring chromosome in order to facilitate genetic counseling.

"This study was aimed at characterizing the bioaccessibility of arsenic (As), mercury (Hg) and methylmercury (MeHg) in commercial fish and seafood species widely consumed by the population of Catalonia (Spain). An accurate evaluation on how bioaccessibility estimations may affect the outcomes of exposure assessment studies was also conducted. The concentrations of As, Hg, and MeHg in samples of fish and seafood incubated in a 3-compartmental (mouth, stomach, and small intestine) in vitro gastrointestinal model, were quantified and compared with the levels of these elements in cooked samples. Arsenic showed a high bioaccessibility in all the fish and seafood species, ranging from 72% (mackerel) to 89% (sardine). In contrast, the bioaccessibility of Hg was rather lower, being <50% for most species, while MeHg could be only quantified in swordfish and tuna. This study elucidates the potential overestimation of health risks to consumers, when the effects of bioaccessibility and cooking procedures are not taken into account in the risk assessment. Unlike As, whose risk is not generally overestimated, Hg and MeHg showed a lower and variable bioaccessibility in marine species, meaning an overestimation of health risks for the adult population. Further studies should assess the bioaccessibility of mercurial species for children. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."
"RNA editing in mammals is a form of post-transcriptional modification in which adenosine is converted to inosine by the adenosine deaminases acting on RNA (ADAR) family of enzymes. Based on evidence of altered ADAR expression in epithelial ovarian cancers (EOC), we hypothesized that single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in ADAR genes modify EOC susceptibility, potentially by altering ovarian tissue gene expression. Using directly genotyped and imputed data from 10,891 invasive EOC cases and 21,693 controls, we evaluated the associations of 5,303 SNPs in ADAD1, ADAR, ADAR2, ADAR3, and SND1. Unconditional logistic regression was used to estimate odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI), with adjustment for European ancestry. We conducted gene-level analyses using the Admixture Maximum Likelihood (AML) test and the Sequence-Kernel Association test for common and rare variants (SKAT-CR). Association analysis revealed top risk-associated SNP rs77027562 (OR (95% CI)= 1.39 (1.17-1.64), P = 1.0x10(-4)) in ADAR3 and rs185455523 in SND1 (OR (95% CI) = 0.68 (0.56-0.83), P = 2.0x10(-4)). When restricting to serous histology (n = 6,500), the magnitude of association strengthened for rs185455523 (OR = 0.60, P = 1.0x10(-4)). Gene-level analyses revealed that variation in ADAR was associated (P < 0.05) with EOC susceptibility, with P-AML = 0.022 and PSKAT-CR = 0.020. Expression quantitative trait locus analysis in EOC tissue revealed significant associations (P < 0.05) with ADAR expression for several SNPs in ADAR, including rs1127313 (G/A), a SNP in the 3' untranslated region. In summary, germline variation involving RNA editing genes may influence EOC susceptibility, warranting further investigation of inherited and acquired alterations affecting RNA editing."
"Although immortalized cells established from cancerous cells have been widely used for studies in nanotoxicology studies, the reliability of the results derived from immortalized cells has been questioned because of their different characteristics from normal cells. In the present study, human primary erythroid cells in liquid culture were used as an in vitro hematological cell model for investigation of the nanotoxicity of silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) and comparing the results to the immortalized hematological cell lines HL60 and K562. The AgNPs caused significant cytotoxic effects in the primary erythroid cells, as shown by the decreased cell viability and induction of intracellular ROS generation and apoptosis, whereas they showed much lower cytotoxic and apoptotic effects in HL60 and K562 cells and did not induced ROS generation in these cell lines. Scanning electron microcopy revealed an interaction of AgNPs to the cell membrane in both primary erythroid and immortalized cells. In addition, AgNPs induced hemolysis in the primary erythroid cells in a dose-dependent manner, and transmission electron microcopy analysis revealed that AgNPs damaged the erythroid cell membrane. Taken together, these results suggest that human primary erythroid cells in liquid culture are a more sensitive alternative in vitro hematological model for nanotoxicology studies.

"A 43-year-old man was struck in the left orbit with his board while surfing and sustained a 3-cm laceration above his left eyebrow. The laceration was sutured closed primarily at a local emergency room. When he presented to UCSD oculoplastics for suture removal, he complained of diplopia with upgaze and was found to have hypoglobus on clinical exam. An orbital CT demonstrated a hyperintense linear signal within the orbit. The patient underwent surgical exploration. A 55-mm-length piece of fiberglass from the patient's surfboard was removed from his orbit. This case demonstrates the importance of having a high index of suspicion for retained orbital foreign bodies, regardless of the size of the object inflicting the injury."
"It is known that the growth of prostate metastatic bone tumor depends on androgens, and tumor formation can start from migratory malignant cells produced in that organ. These cells exhibit grater type 1 5 alpha-reductase (5 alpha-R1) activity than type 2 5 alpha-reductase. Noteworthy, both isozymes convert testosterone (T) to the more active androgen dihydrotestosterone (DHT) in the target tissues. Thus, in order to potentially improve the prognosis of this disease, in this work, seven derivatives of 17-(1H-benzimidazol-1-yl)-16-formillandrosta-5,16-dien-3 beta-yl benzoate (4a-f) and 17-(1H-benzimidazol-1-yl)-3-hydroxy-16-formylandrost-5,16-diene (4) were synthesized, characterized and identified as inhibitors of type 1 5 alpha-reductase (5 alpha R1). These derivatives having the advantage of improved plasma half-life. The inhibitory activity of the compounds towards 5 alpha-R1 isoenzyme was determined by conversion of T into DHT in the presence or absence of compounds 4, 4a-f. Further, in vivo experiments were also carried out, treating gonadectomized hamsters with T and/or 4, 4a-f and evaluating their effect on the diameter of hamster flank organs and on the weight of the prostatic and seminal vesicles. Results indicated that compounds 4, 4b, 4c, served as in vitro inhibitors of the enzyme 5 alpha-R1 and pharmacological experiments showed that 4 and derivatives 4a-f decreased the diameter of the flank glands, the weight of the prostate and seminal vesicles of treated hamsters without any appreciable toxicity during observation. Noteworthy the fact that compound 4 is the product, in all cases, of the hydrolysis of the series of esters 4a-f, thus they can serve as precursors (prodrugs) of the active form 4."
"To reduce the time of recording echo signals by an antenna array that operates in the double-scanning mode, it was proposed to use a set of pseudo-orthogonal coding signals. As the coding signals, it is possible to use frequency-modulated signals or phase-manipulated signals according to the Kasami code by analogy to the FDMA or CDMA techniques for multichannel communication. The use of the maximum-entropy method for decoding echo signals made it possible to reduce the noise level and increase the longitudinal resolution of reflector images in comparison to the case of using matched filtering. If an image is formed as the coherent sum of several partial images that are reconstructed using the C-SAFT method for various positions of the antenna array, it is proposed to use several sets of Kasami codes in order to additionally reduce the noise level by more than 6 dB. Numerical experiments show the efficiency of the proposed approach."
"Graphene-supported uranium dioxide (UO2) nanocrystals are potentially important fuel materials. Here, we investigate the possibility of synthesizing graphene-supported UO2 nanocrystals in polar ethylene glycol compounds by the polyol reduction of uranyl acetylacetone under boiling reflux, thereby enabling the use of an inexpensive graphene precursor graphene oxide into a one-pot process. We show that triethylene glycol is the most suitable solvent with an appropriate reduction potential for producing nanometer-sized UO2 crystals compared to monoethylene glycol, diethylene glycol, and polyethylene glycol. Graphene-supported UO2 nanocrystals synthesized with triethylene glycol show evidence of heteroepitaxy, which can be beneficial for facilitating heat transfer in nuclear fuel particles. Furthermore, we show that graphene-supported UO2 nanocrystals synthesized by polyol reduction can be readily stored in alcohols, impeding oxidation from the prevalent oxygen in air. Together, these methods provide a facile approach for preparing and storing graphene-supported UO2 nanocrystals for further investigation and development under ambient conditions.

"This paper presents a flexible, lattice-based structural credit risk model that uses equity market information and a detailed depiction of a financial institution's liability structure to analyze default risk. The model is applied to examine the term structure of default probabilities for Lehman Brothers prior to its demise. The results indicate, as early as March, that the firm would likely lose access to external capital within two years. The model can be used as both a diagnostic tool for the early detection of financial distress and a prescriptive tool for addressing the sources of risk in large, complex financial institutions.

"Despite the importance of including children's preferences in the valuation of their own health benefits, no study has investigated the ability of children to understand willingness-to-pay (WTP) questions. Using a contingent valuation method, we elicit children's and parents' WTP to reduce children's risk of an asthma attack. Our results suggest that children are able to understand and value their own health risk reductions, and their ability to do so improves with age. Child age was found to be inversely related to parents' and children's WTP. The results also suggest that non-paternalistic altruism is predictive of children's WTP. For parents, care for their own health was found to be inversely related with their WTP for children's risk reductions. Comparison of parents' and children's WTP suggests that parents are willing to sacrifice for their child's health risk reduction an amount that is approximately twice that of their children. The analysis of matched pairs of parents and children suggest that there are within-household similarities as the child's WTP is positively related to parents' WTP."
"Background: Primary diffuse leptomeningeal gliomatosis (PDLG) is a very rare neuro-oncological disease, with only 90 cases of PDLG described in medical literature so far. Case presentation: We present a case report of a 56-years-old female patient, who was originally hospitalized due to cervical spine pain lasting several months. Despite complex diagnostics and treatment, the neurological state of the patient progressively deteriorated. Patient died 10 months after the first reported symptom. Postmortem pathological findings resulted in the diagnosis of PDLG. Conclusions: Affection of the cervical spine in early stages of PDLG is rare and has been described in only six patients so far. PDLG is a fatal neuro-oncological disease and it must be kept in mind in the differential diagnosis of persistent back pain syndromes."
"To explicitly understand the function of extracellular polymeric substances in the treatment of ammonium-nitrogen-rich wastewater using aerobic granular sludge, the three forms of nitrogen (ammonium, nitrite and nitrate nitrogen) contained in tightly and loosely bound extracellular polymeric substances were analyzed. The three forms of nitrogen were monitored in the tightly and loosely bound extracellular polymeric substances in aerobic granular sludge after adsorption. The ammonium nitrogen contained in the extracellular polymeric substances was distributed in both the tightly and loosely bound forms and decreased gradually as the aeration time increased. Ammonium nitrogen remained in the tightly bound extracellular polymeric substances even after aeration was complete. The nitrite and nitrate nitrogen species in the extracellular polymeric substances were mainly present in the loosely bound extracellular polymeric substances. The sources of the three nitrogen forms detected in the extracellular polymeric substances differed relative to the different nitrogen forms. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."
"Although there are different treatment technologies to reduce water pollution, a few of them are efficient in pathogenic organism removal. Nowadays, near-nature systems like constructed wetlands (CWs) have been encouraged as alternative to remove this kind of organisms, due to their low operational and maintenance cost. The aim of this research was to evaluate different combinations (vertical and horizontal flow) of constructed wetlands as a possible technology for pathogen reduction under tropical climate (Colombia), as a result of the few research made about this kind of hybrid systems (train with vertical and horizontal systems) in tropical regions. The combination of vertical and horizontal subsurface flow CW showed the highest performance for the removal of total coliform, Escherichia coli (3 log units and 4 log units, respectively) and Helminth eggs (90%) allowing water reuse. Also for nitrogen reduction, this wetlands combination displayed the best results (more than 90%). Besides pathogen parameters, BOD5, COD, TSS were evaluated in the different experimental units and the results achieved a removal rate of >85% for all experimental units. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

"The aim of this research to analyze the multiple figures in the fresco Coronation of Blessed Virgin Mary on the copula of the Pazaislis Church. I accentuate the iconographic program in the whole context of the Monastery of Camaldoli. I first investigate the iconography of angels (seraphims, cherubims, musical angels) and saints (martyrs and professors) and identify each person. Second, I note that in European Church Art Mary's Coronation is the culmination of the iconographic program. It was often represented on copulas as a magnificent finalization. Following baroque symbolism tradition, the cupola possessed an excess purpose"" role. Therefore the saints are raised to the highest level"". This church copula fresco should be characterized as a unique baroque painting and a phenomenon of Christian spiritual culture."
"Pulmonary embolism is the main cause of death of pregnant women in developed countries. An increased prothrombotic activity is observed during pregnancy. Moreover the risk of venous thromboembolic disease can be elevated in cases of inherited thrombophilia, antiphospholipid syndrome or previous venous thormboembolic events, According to presented guidelines of The Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and The American College of Chest Physicians, the risk stratification of venous thromboembolic disease during pregnancy and puerperium is a vital condition and proper antithrombotic prophylaxis should be implemented,"
"Background: Detecting more colorectal liver metastases (CRLMs) during surgery may help optimise strategy and improve outcomes. Our objective was to determine clinical utility (CU) of contrast-enhanced intra-operative ultrasound (CE-IOUS) using sulphur hexafluoride microbubbles during CRLM surgery. Method: A prospective phase II trial performed at two comprehensive cancer research centres. Patients operated for CRLMs were eligible and assessable if intra-operative ultrasound (IOUS) and CE-IOUS had been performed and pathological results were available and/or 3-month imaging. CU was defined as the justified change in planned surgical strategy or procedure using CE-IOUS. Results: Out of the 68 patients enrolled, 54 were eligible and assessable. 43 patients underwent preoperative chemotherapy. The median number of CRLMs was 2 (range, 1-11). Pre-operative staging was performed using MRI. IOUS allowed identification of 45 new CRLMs in 13 (24.7%) patients. Compared to IOUS, CE-IOUS allowed identification of 10 additional CRLMs in 9 (16.7%) patients. Surgery was altered and justified in 4 patients only, leading to a CU rate of 7.70% (95 CI, [3.2, 18.6]). No missing CRLMs were identified by CE-IOUS. Conclusions: Although the primary endpoint was not met for one protocol violation, secondary endpoints indicate that CE-IOUS has an intermediate added-value for surgeons treating CRLMs. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd, BASO - The Association for Cancer Surgery, and the European Society of Surgical Oncology.

"Background: Peritonitis is the most serious complication of peritoneal dialysis (PD). We previously showed that high levels of interleukin (IL)-12 and IL-18 in PD effluents (PDE) during the early phase of peritonitis correlated with a predominant Type I immune response and a favorable outcome in PD-related peritonitis. To further clarify the longitudinal changes of peritoneal immunity during PD-related peritonitis, we examined the kinetic production of IL-17 in PDE during peritonitis. The correlation between the IL-17 expression pattern and peritonitis outcome was analyzed. Methods: The levels of IL-17 were measured in PDE during various phases of peritonitis in 38 patients undergoing PD. The patients were divided into two groups, according to whether they had a rapid versus a delayed response to antibiotic treatment. Results: The kinetic expression of IL-17, as measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, differed between the two groups. In the rapid response group, high level of IL-17 was detected in PDE initially and progressively decreased during treatment. In the delayed response group, IL-17 levels in PDE were persistently low throughout the whole course of treatment. In the early phase of peritonitis, the IL-17 levels in PDE were significantly higher in the rapid response group (p < 0.05). Conclusion: These data suggested that local IL-17 production is part of a protective early immune response to PD-related peritonitis. High levels of IL-17 in PDE during the early phase of peritonitis correlated with a favorable outcome. Manipulation of IL-17 cytokine expression in patients with peritonitis may modulate peritoneal immune response and affect peritonitis outcome.

"The next generation of sustainable energy could come from microorganisms; evidence that it can be seen with the given rise of Electromicrobiology, the study of microorganisms' electrical properties. Many recent advances in electromicrobiology stem from studying microbial fuel cells (MFCs), which are gaining acceptance as a future alternative ""green"" energy technology and energy-efficient wastewater treatment method. MFCs are powered by living microorganisms with clean and sustainable features; they efficiently catalyse the degradation of a broad range of organic substrates under natural conditions. There is also increasing interest in photosynthetic MFCs designed to harness Earth's most abundant and promising energy source (solar irradiation). Despite their vast potential and promise, however, MFCs and photosynthetic MFCs have not yet successfully translated into commercial applications because they demonstrate persistent performance limitations and bottlenecks associated with scaling up. Instead, microscale MFCs have received increasing attention as a unique platform for various applications such as powering small portable electronic elements in remote locations, performing fundamental studies of microorganisms, screening bacterial strains, and toxicity detection in water. Furthermore, the staddng of miniaturized MFCs has been demonstrated to offer larger power densities than a single macroscale MFC in terms of scaling up. In this overview, we discuss recent achievements in microscale MFCs as well as their potential applications. Further scientific and technological challenges are also reviewed. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

"Catalytically active colloids maintain nonequilibrium conditions in which they produce and deplete chemicals and hence effectively act as sources and sinks of molecules. While individual colloids that are symmetrically coated do not exhibit any form of dynamical activity, the concentration fields resulting from their chemical activity decay as 1/r and produce gradients that attract or repel other colloids depending on their surface chemistry and ambient variables. This results in a nonequilibrium analog of ionic systems, but with the remarkable novel feature of action-reaction symmetry breaking. We study solutions of such chemically active colloids in dilute conditions when they join up to form molecules via generalized ionic bonds and discuss how we can achieve structures with time-dependent functionality. In particular, we study a molecule that adopts a spontaneous oscillatory pattern of conformations and another that exhibits a run-and-tumble dynamics similar to bacteria. Our study shows that catalytically active colloids could be used for designing self-assembled structures that possess dynamical functionalities that are determined by their prescribed three-dimensional structures, a strategy that follows the design principle of proteins."
"The current article presents the results of a longitudinal investigation of the relationship between number sense and mathematical achievement across the primary school years. We analyzed the data of 133 participants from the Russian Longitudinal Study of Academic Achievement on symbolic and non-symbolic number sense ability and mathematical achievement in Grades 3 and 4. The mean age at Grade 3 was 9.82 years (SD = 0.3) and 10.82 years at Grade 4 (SD = 0.3). We used the cross-lagged analysis to explore the causal relationship between number sense and mathematical achievement. Our analysis revealed that the reciprocal model best described the empirical data suggesting the cross-lagged relation between number sense accuracy and academic achievement in Math. The results of our longitudinal study have shown differences in the association the mathematical achievement with the two aspects of number sense- symbolic and non-symbolic representation. Thus, mathematical achievement in Grade 3 predicted only the symbolic estimation ability in Grade 4. On the contrary, mathematical achievement at Grade 3 had no significant effect on another aspect of number sense, non-symbolic estimation ability, by the end of primary school. We also found differences in the stability of the two aspects of number sense at primary school age. Thus, non-symbolic number sense ability was the most stable over time. The results were discussed in the context of a theoretical problem of the association of cognitive development and school education."
"Specific components of mechatronic systems dedicated to textile and leather equipment and technology. Part I The increase of production quality for each textile or leather product is directly influenced by the main equipment components involved in textile and leather technologies. Development of new solutions for the equipment in this field and quality increase of the existing equipment require continuous theoretical and experimental studies in order to improve their specific components. Mechatronic systems involved in the textile and leather equipment structures have a special role in the development of modern cosntructive solutions. The paper presents some aspects concerning experimental models of mechatronic systems dedicated to the control of certain textile and leather processes and their specific equipment. The studies were focused on pointing out the connection between different types of mechatronic components and the technical system structures of the textile and leather industry, as well as their influence on the processes specific to this field. The experimental models can offer different types of control, such as control of yarn tension or ring + spindle centering, as important factors for assuring yarn quality on ring spinning machines."
"Lipodystrophies are an immense group of genetic or acquired metabolic disorders that are characterized by varying degrees of body fat loss and in some instances localized accumulation of subcutaneous fat. Lipodystrophies are often tightly linked with profound metabolic complications; this strong bond emphasizes and reinforces the significance of adipose tissue as a dynamic endocrine organ. The extent of fat loss determines the severity of associated metabolic complications such as diabetes mellitus, hypertriglyceridemia and hepatic steatosis. The lipodystrophies can be divided into generalized, partial or local, depending on the degree and locality of the observable fat loss; moreover, the generalized and partial divisions can be partitioned further into inherited or acquired forms. The major genetic factors in the generalized forms of the lipodystrophies, particularly Congenital generalized lipodystrophy (CGL)-Berardinelli-Seip syndrome, are the AGPAT2, BSCL2, caveolin 1 (CAV1) and polymerase-I-and-transcriptrelease factor (PTRF) genes. In the acquired forms, genes such as LMNA, PPARG, CIDEC (cell-death-inducing DNA fragmentation factor a-like effector c) and PLIN1 are heavily involved in familial partial lipodystrophy (FPLD) type 2 (also known as the Dunnigan-Variety) and WRN along with RECQL5 in Werner Syndrome (WS). Autoimmune causes are particularly noted in acquired partial lipodystrophy (APL)-Barraquer-Simons syndrome and in AGL-Lawrence syndrome; panniculitis has been shown to have a substantial role in the former as well as in other forms of localized lipodystrophies. Patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) exposed to protease inhibitors, nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) (for example, zidovudine and stavudine) or non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs) (for example, efavirenz) while undergoing Highly Active Antiretroviral Therapy (HAART) have led to the current most-prevalent form of the lipodystrophies: lipodystrophy in HIV-infected patients (LD-HIV) and HAART-associated lipodystrophy syndrome (HALS)."
"The results of an investigation of some factors affecting the construction of the light curves for solar flares in the H alpha line are presented. It is determined that the type of the light curve depends on the method of measuring the intensity, the size of the measurement window, and the brightness fluctuations of the quiet chromosphere areas (the reference areas). The light curves constructed on the basis of the flare's peak intensity show a real picture of the flare development process. A method for the selection of the ""reference areas"" is suggested."
"5,20-Dibenzoyl [28]hexaphyrin(1.1.1.1.1.1) was synthesized as the first hexaphyrin bearing meso-aroyl sub-stituents. The meso-dibenzoyl substituents are hydrogen-bonded with the pyrrolic protons to stabilize an antiaromatic dumbbell conformer. Core metalation of this hexaphyrin with Au-III afforded rectangular and aromatic [26]hexaphyrin bis-Au-III complexes, the major isomer of which was reduced with NaBH4 to give its antiaromatic 28 pi bis-Au-III complex. This complex allowed facile peripheral metalation with B-III owing to the peripheral benzoyl substituents."
"A one-target-multitriggered hybridization chain reaction (MHCR) strategy was designed for ultrasensitive electrochemical detection of DNA by combining the isothermal strand-displacement polymerase reaction (ISDPR) with the DNA self-assembly on a DNA sensor surface. The sensor was constructed by immobilizing a hairpin-like capture probe (CP) on a gold electrode via an Au-S bond. The ISDPR was triggered by the hybridization of the target DNA to open the CP and primer to anneal the complementary part in the bottom of the exposed stem and the extension of the primer in the presence of dNTPs and polymerase. Each target copy could produce a few opened CPs. Afterwards, the other part of the exposed stem acted as an initiator to trigger the hybridization chain reaction (HCR) when incubated with two hairpin monomers. Using [Ru(NH3)(6)](3+) as an electrochemically active indicator to interact with the MHCR product, the amperometric response demonstrated a perfect multiple amplification effect. The constructed sensor showed a high sensitivity for detection of the target DNA in a linear range from 0.1 fM to 10 pM, a detection limit down to 0.02 fM (3 sigma) and good selectivity for base discrimination. This method did not need any modification or labelling process. The proposed strategy provides a powerful tool for cascade signal amplification and has a wide potential application in bioanalysis."
"Reasons for performing study: The increasing prevalence of antimicrobial resistant bacteria such as antimicrobial-resistant and extended spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Escherichia coli represents a significant problem for human and veterinary medicine. Despite this, the risk factors for faecal carriage of such bacteria by horses in the UK, particularly those in the wider community, have not been well described. Objectives: To characterise the risk factors for faecal carriage of antimicrobial-resistant E. coli amongst horses in the mainland UK. Methods: A cross-sectional study of horses recruited by 65 randomly selected equine veterinary practices was conducted, with a faecal sample collected and self-administered questionnaire completed by the horse owner. Faecal samples were cultured for antimicrobial-resistant E. coli, with isolates confirmed as E. coli having their antimicrobial resistance profile determined. Multilevel, multivariable logistic regression models were used to investigate risk factors for the carriage of antimicrobial-resistant E. coli in the sample population. Results: Faecal samples and completed questionnaires were obtained for 627 horses located on 475 premises. Recent hospitalisation, contact with specific types of nonequid animals, the type of premises, the surrounding land use, the reason for veterinary treatment received in the last 6 months and antimicrobial treatment in the previous 10 days were identified as risk factors for many of the antimicrobial-resistance outcomes considered. Being stabled on the same yard as a recently hospitalised horse was identified as a risk factor for increased risk of carriage of ESBL-producing E. coli. Conclusions and potential relevance: Increasing antimicrobial resistance may have significant health implications for the horse population of Great Britain. This form of epidemiological investigation highlights potential risk factors that may be controlled to limit the extent of the problem."
"Fluorescent chitosan-graft-polyethyleneimine (PEI) copolymer was prepared by incorporating PEI molecule onto chitosan backbone through naphthalimide moiety by simple substitution reaction. 4-Bromo-1,8-naphthalic anhydride was used as fluorescent probe due to its strong fluorescence and good photo-stability property and the presence of a fine tunable bromide functional group in the naphthalimide ring, in this work. The copolymer was characterized by FTIR, elemental analysis and XRD. The fluorescence property of the copolymer was determined by UV-vis spectrometer and spectrofluorometer. The effects of pH and temperature on fluorescence property of the copolymer were also studied. The graft copolymer with degree of substitution 37.6 of PEI onto chitosan showed better complexation ability with DNA at comparatively low N/P (nitrogen to phosphate ratio) ratio 1.0 compared to that of chitosan (N/P ratio 2.0). The cytotoxicity of PEI largely decreased after grafting with chitosan and all the copolymers showed above 50% cell viability even at high polymer concentration (300 mu g/mL). Therefore, the prepared fluorescent chitosan-graft-PEI copolymer may be used as a biological marker as well as drug or gene carrier with low toxicity. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."
"Background: The major causes of morbidity and mortality of patients with chronic liver disease are liver fibrosis and cirrhosis. Previous studies have been concerned with immune dysfunction in the pathogenesis of cirrhosis progress. However, the potential molecular mechanism of how the liver's fibrotic state favors tumor progression is still unclear. We attempted to reveal deviations of the immune cell landscape between various liver tissues and identify key biomarkers associated with patients' outcomes. Method: CIBERSORT was used for estimating the proportions of immune cells in various liver tissues. Comparative studies were carried out by Kruskal-Wallis test and Wilcoxon test. For survival analyses, the Cox proportional hazard regression model, Kaplan-Meier estimates, and log-rank test were used. Results: Significantly different adaptive and innate immune cell types were selected, including T cells, plasma cells, and resting mast cells. Meanwhile, the immune cell landscapes in The Cancer Genome Atlas' (TCGA) hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients with different degrees of fibrosis were also calculated. Comparative studies and survival analysis were carried out. Resting mast cell and activated NK cells in HCC patients with fibrosis was significantly lower than that in other HCC patients without fibrosis. Then, the potential genes involved in immune cells and significantly associated with patients' outcome were identified. These genes may be potential novel checkpoints for immunotherapy, including PVRIG related to NK resting/activated cells and T cell CD8+ infiltration which was recently targeted in breast cancer. Furthermore, Pearson correlation coefficient analysis suggested that PVRIG is significantly positively related to other checkpoint molecules and Teff gene signatures. Conclusions: Alternative treatments, including immunotherapies, are necessary and urgent for HCC. Although checkpoint inhibitors that block CTLA-4 and PD-1 have improved cancer immunotherapies, targeting additional checkpoint receptors may be required to broaden patient response to immunotherapy. Our studies may find possible ways to select novel targets and improve immunotherapy efficacy by disrupting their function and promoting immune infiltration in advanced HCC patients with higher fibrosis and even cirrhosis."
"Developments in the fields of protein chemistry and pharmaceutical biotechnology have increased the demand for suitable analytical techniques for the characterization of intact proteins. Capillary electrophoresis (CE) coupled to mass spectrometry (MS) has proven to be a powerful tool for this purpose because it combines high separation efficiency with mass selectivity. This article provides an overview of CE-MS method development work in our laboratory for biopharmaceutical analysis applying noncovalent capillary coatings to prevent protein adsorption. Technological aspects with respect to the use of CE-MS interfaces and types of noncovalent capillary coatings applied are treated. Furthermore, some typical examples are highlighted to demonstrate the versatility of CE-MS for the analysis of biopharmaceuticals. These include the analysis of recombinant human growth hormone, recombinant human interferon-beta-1a, recombinant human erythropoietin and protein-drug conjugates. We concluded that there is strong potential for CE-MS systems using noncovalent coated capillaries for purity and stability analysis of biopharmaceuticals."
"Heavy metal concentrations of Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Fe, Mn, Pb, Ni and Zn in muscles, livers, gonads and gills of flathead mullet (Mugil cephalus Linneaus, 1758), leaping mullet (Liza saliens Risso, 1810), gilthead seabream (Sparus aurata Linneaus, 178), European seabass (Dicentrarchus labrax Linneaus, 1758) and thicklip grey mullet (Chelon labrosus Risso, 1827) from Hurmabogazi Lagoon were monitored. Heavy metal concentrations found in tissues varied for Cd divided by (0.11-0.25), Co divided by (0.02-0.22), Cr divided by (0.27-0.84), Cu divided by (0.51-15.8), Fe divided by (31.9-137.0), Mn divided by (0.42-4.97), Ni divided by (0.18-4.39), Pb divided by (0.28-1.57) and Zn divided by (4.41-61.7) mg kg(-1) wet weight. The values of all metals in muscles of analyzed fish in the present study stayed below the established limit values. Consequently, it might be concluded that these metals in the edible parts of the examined species should not pose any public health problems."
"Six rhenium(I) complexes are structurally compared, with regards to steric and electronic influences induced by the different beta-diketone (benzoylacetone - Benzac, trifluoroacetylacetone-Tfaa and hexafluoroacetylacetone - Hfaa) and phosphine ligands (cyclohexyldiphenyl phosphine - PPh2Cy and dicyclohexylphenyl phosphine - PPhCy2). The complexes jac-lRe(Benzac)(CO)(3)(PPh2CY)1 (2), fac-[Re(Benzac)(CO)(3)(PPhCy2)] (3), fac-Ille(aa)(CO)(3)(PPh2CY)] (5), fac-IRe(Tfaa)(CO)(3)(PPhCy2)] (6), fac-[Re(Hfaa) (CO)(3)(PPh2Cy)] (8) and fac-Ilte(Hfaa)(CO)(3)(PPhCY2)1 (9) were synthesized by using the '2 + 1' mixed ligand approach and characterized by means of lR, UV-Vis, H-1, C-13 and P-31 NMR and also X-ray diffraction, clearly showing the increase in the carbonyl stretching frequencies and downfield shifts in the P-31 NMR as the fluoro atoms on the ligand backbone increases. The Tolman angles for the coordinated phosphine ligands are: 2 = 134.77 degrees; 3 molecule A = 146.81 degrees; 5 =134.46 degrees; 6 =146.05 degrees; 8 =136.68 degrees and 9 = 146.22 degrees, illustrating the change in steric bulk as the cyclohexyl ligands on the phosphine ligands increase. A direct link is noted between the Re-P distances (2.4906(6) angstrom for 2, 2.5213(17) angstrom for 3 molecule A, 2.4865(16) angstrom for 5, 2.5372(15) angstrom for 6, 2.4906(14) angstrom for 8 and 2.5365(16) angstrom for 9), O,O'-bidentate ligand bite angles, O4-Re-O5, (85.12(6)degrees for 2, 83.34(13)degrees for 3 molecule A, 84.91(12)degrees for 5, 83.53(12)degrees for 6, 84.54(11)degrees for 8 and 83.7(2)degrees for 9) and the calculated dihedral angles (3.677(1) for 2, 12.521(1)* for 3 molecule A, 1.489(7)degrees for 5, 12.463(11)degrees for 6, 2.940(7)degrees for 8 and 11.747(6)degrees for 9). The dihedral angle is calculated between the equatorial plane (Re1, C1, O1, C2, O2, O4, C5, C6, C7, O5) and the plane through Re1, O4, C5, C6, C7, O5. Dihedral angles of approximately four times larger are observed in complexes with coordinated PPhCy2 ligands compared to the PPh2Cy containing analogues, indicating the steric effect induced on the bidentate ligand by the extra cyclohexyl substituent on the PPhCy2 ligand.

"Image quality is an important practical challenge that is often overlooked in the design of machine vision systems. Commonly, machine vision systems are trained and tested on high-quality image datasets, yet in practical applications the input images cannot be assumed to be of high quality. Modern deep neural networks (DNNs) have been shown to perform poorly on images affected by blur or noise distortions. In this work, we investigate whether human subjects also perform poorly on distorted stimuli and provide a direct comparison with the performance of DNNs. Specifically, we study the effect of Gaussian blur and additive Gaussian noise on human and DNN classification performance. We perform two experiments: one crowd-sourced experiment with unlimited stimulus display time, and one lab experiment with 100ms display time. In both cases, we found that humans outperform neural networks on distorted stimuli, even when the networks are retrained with distorted data."
"Pseudomonas aeruginosa secretes the fluorescent siderophore, pyoverdine (PVD), to enable iron acquisition. Epifluorescence microscopy and cellular fractionation were used to investigate the role of an efflux pump, PvdRT-OpmQ, in PVD secretion. Bacteria lacking this efflux pump accumulated PVD, or a fluorescent precursor, in the periplasm, due to their inability to efficiently secrete into the media newly synthesized PVD. PvdRT-OpmQ is only the second system identified for secretion of newly synthesized siderophores by Gram negative bacteria. (c) 2010 Federation of European Biochemical Societies.

"A low crystalline Fe-oxyhydroxy sulfate (FeOS) was used to immobilize arsenic (As) in soils in this study. The effects of FeOS amount, treatment time and soil moisture on As immobilization were investigated. The results showed that water-soluble and NaHCO3-extractable As were immobilized by 53.4-99.8 and 13.8-73.3% respectively, with 1-10 % of FeOS addition. The highest immobilization of water-soluble (98.5 %) and NaHCO3-extractable arsenic (47.2 %) was achieved under condition of 4 % of FeOS and 80 % of soil moisture. Further, more amounts of FeOS addition resulted in less time requirement for As immobilization. Sequential chemical extraction experiment revealed that easily mobile arsenic phase was transferred to less mobile phase. The FeOS-bonded As may play a significant role in arsenic immobilization. Under leaching with simulated acid rain at 60 times pore volumes, accumulation amount of As release from untreated soil and soil amended with FeOS were 98.4 and 1.2 mg, respectively, which correspond to 7.69 and 0.09 % of total As amounts in soil. The result showed that the low crystalline FeOS can be used as a suitable additive for arsenic immobilization in soils."
"This paper proposes a nonparametric Bayesian framework called VariScan for simultaneous clustering, variable selection, and prediction in high-throughput regression settings. Poisson-Dirichlet processes are utilized to detect lower-dimensional latent clusters of covariates. An adaptive nonlinear prediction model is constructed for the response, achieving a balance between model parsimony and flexibility. Contrary to conventional belief, cluster detection is shown to be a posteriori consistent for a general class of models as the number of covariates and subjects grows. Simulation studies and data analyses demonstrate that VariScan often outperforms several well-known statistical methods."
"Vertebrate akirin genes usually form a family with one-to-three members that regulate gene expression during the innate immune response, carcinogenesis and myogenesis. We recently established that an expanded family of eight akirin genes is conserved across salmonid fish. Here, we measured mRNA levels of the akirin family of Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar L) during the differentiation of primary myoblasts cultured from fast-skeletal muscle. Using hierarchical clustering and correlation, the data was positioned into a network of expression profiles including twenty further genes that regulate myogenesis. akirin1(2b) was not significantly regulated during the maturation of the cell culture. akirin2(1a) and 2(1b), along with IGF-II and several igfbps, were most highly expressed in mononuclear cells, then significantly and constitutively downregulated as differentiation proceeded and myotubes formed/matured. Conversely, akirin1(1a), 1(16), 1(2a), 2(2a) and 2(2b) were expressed at lowest levels when mononuclear cells dominated the culture and highest levels when confluent layers of myotubes were evident. However, akirin1(2a) and 2(2a) were first upregulated earlier than akirin1(1a), 1(1b) and 2(2b), when rates of myoblast proliferation were highest. Interestingly, akirin1(1b), 1(2a), 2(2a) and 2(2b) formed part of a module of co-expressed genes involved in muscle differentiation, including myod1a, myog, mef2a, 14-3-3 beta and 14-3-3 gamma. All akirin paralogues were expressed ubiquitously across ten tissues, although mRNA levels were regulated between cell-types and family members. Gene expression patterns were often highly correlated between akirin paralogues, suggesting that natural selection has maintained an intricate network of co-regulation among family members. We concluded that the Atlantic salmon akirin family performs a multifaceted role during myogenesis and has physiological functions spanning many cell-types. (c) 2010 Elsevier Inc.

"Background: The association of hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection and pancreatic cancer is still controversial. The purpose of this study is to determine whether chronic HBV infection increases the risk. Methods: In this case-control study, there were 1,066 patients recruited, with 533 in the study group and 533 controls, frequency-matched for age and sex. Blood samples were collected to detect hepatitis viral infection. Results: Compared to 77 patients (14.4%) in the control group, 80 pancreatic cancer patients (15.0%) were seropositive for HBV surface antigen (not statistically significant, P=0.8). The prevalence of HBV e antigen was higher in study group than that of control group (P=0.03). Further analysis indicated that HBeAg was a risk factor for pancreatic cancer (OR=2.935, 95% CI: 1.048-8.220). Conclusions: In HBV endemic area of China, there appears to be no significant association between chronic HBV infection and pancreatic cancer, but the role of HBeAg needs further exploration."
"In this work, the degradation process of natural ester-based insulating fluids was evaluated through laboratory aging tests. Two distinct aging methodologies were used: natural ester-based insulating fluids were placed in sealed flasks at 120 degrees C in the presence of Kraft insulating paper containing about 1.5 and 5 wt% moisture; and natural ester-based insulating fluids were aged with and without Kraft insulating paper containing 1.5 wt% moisture in an open system, adding oxygen at different temperatures. The results indicate that viscosity, acid number and dissipation factor are important markers to consider in monitoring service-aged natural ester fluids."
"A mechanism is presented for the pulses of high fluid pressure (P-F) necessary for fluid-assisted brecciation. Establishment of hydraulic- or pneumatic-connectivity between rock masses with different P-F can cause overpressure in the higher rocks because the P-F gradient is parallel to the hydrostatic gradient (the centroid effect). P-F can become high enough to create a fracture network, with an influx of fluids and mineralisation occurring as fluids migrate to areas of lower P-F. Changes in P-F caused by the centroid effect can cause other structures and seismicity."
"Nanoparticle-based therapeutics are being used to treat patients with solid tumors. Whereas nanoparticles have been shown to preferentially accumulate in solid tumors of animal models, there is little evidence to prove that intact nanoparticles localize to solid tumors of humans when systemically administered. Here, tumor and adjacent, nonneoplastic tissue biopsies are obtained through endoscopic capture from patients with gastric, gastroesophageal, or esophageal cancer who are administered the nanoparticle CRLX101. Both the pre- and postdosing tissue samples adjacent to tumors show no definitive evidence of either the nanoparticle or its drug payload (camptothecin, CPT) contained within the nanoparticle. Similar results are obtained from the predosing tumor samples. However, in nine of nine patients that were evaluated, CPT is detected in the tumor tissue collected 24-48 h after CRLX101 administration. For five of these patients, evidence of the intact deposition of CRLX101 nanoparticles in the tumor tissue is obtained. Indications of CPT pharmacodynamics from tumor biomarkers such as carbonic anhydrase IX and topoisomerase I by immunohistochemistry show clear evidence of biological activity from the delivered CPT in the posttreatment tumors."
"The present study is an attempt to understand the properties of an interesting self-assembled monolayer system composed of inclusion complexes of thiocholesterol and cyclodextrins. Cyclodextrins were used as host compound while thiocholesterol was used as the entrant molecule into the cavity of cyclodextrins. The improved electron transfer barrier property towards a redox couple indicates a sturdy inclusion complex monolayer. A very large R-ct value, 64.6 k Omega.cm(2) for a redox system was obtained in the case of methyl-beta-cyclodextrin and thiocholesterol inclusion complex self-assembledmonolayer. A rather low value of capacitance 1.2 mu F cm(-2) measured in supporting electrolyte further signifies the fact that inclusion complex monolayer is quite impermeable for ionic species. In addition lateral force microscopy combined with force-distance analysis revealed the presence of an interesting mixed hydrophilic/hydrophobic surface. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."
"With the development of the transverse tunneling current theory, electrode-embedded nanopore is considered as one of the most promising devices for label-free DNA sequencing. Though there have been a few approaches to fabricate transverse electrode-embedded nanopores, the method universality and nanogap control are still formidable tasks of fabricating a nano-scale electrode-nanopore sensor. In this work, a cross-scale approach of fabricating nano-electrodes was proposed, and a 10 nm-width nano-electrode was obtained from 5 Am-width aurum (Au) line. Compared with traditional methods, only electron microscopy was involved in this process, which was a simple and effective method to fabricate electrode-embedded nanopores. Furthermore, the gap of nano electrodes was controllable as the nano-electrode was cut off by drilling nanopore. The feasibility of the method was investigated by practice. This article demonstrated a novel approach to fabricate transverse electrode-embedded nanopore which showed great application potential in fabricating nano-electrodes with gap smaller than 2 nm."
"This paper examines the role of full-duplex radio for securing wireless network from a new perspective. It first studies the secrecy capacity of two single-antenna full-duplex users against a multi-antenna eavesdropper (Eve) who has the perfect knowledge of the channel state information (CSI) from users to Eve. It is shown that if Eve uses a basic matched-filtering, the probability of zero secrecy (or outage) can be made small by a large jamming power from both users and a small gain of residual self-interference (RSI) power. But if Eve uses the optimal matched-filtering, the probability of outage grows rapidly as either the jamming power from the users increases or the number of antennas on Eve increases, regardless of the RSI gain. To prevent any Eve from obtaining its CSI, this paper then proposes a novel anti-eavesdropping channel estimation (ANECE) method, which allows users to obtain their own CSI while keeping all Eves in handicap. This method also prevents Eves from colluding with each other at any layer. The design of ideal pilots for ANECE for multiple multi-antenna users and multiple broadband multi-antenna users is discussed. It is also shown that the capacity of Eve with any number of antennas but without its CSI can be virtually eliminated over a time window corresponding to the number of antennas at the transmitter for each realization of the CSI."
"Experimental evidence supporting the theory of hot tail runaway electron (RE) generation has been identified in TEXTOR disruptions. With higher temperature, more REs are generated during the thermal quench. Increasing the RE generation by increasing the temperature, an obvious RE plateau is observed even with low toroidal magnetic field (1.7 T). These results explain the previously found electron density threshold for RE generation."
"The corrosion of a wire rope reduces its life expectancy. In this study, repeated bending tests were conducted using a bending fatigue tester by changing the tensile load and corrosion time of wire ropes, which were the same type as those used in elevators. The number of broken wires was studied, and a tensile test was conducted for cases in which the fracture was severe. The effect of corrosion fatigue on life expectancy was considered by comparing fracture strength values and observing fracture surfaces. The results indicate that an increase in accumulated corrosion fatigue, a greater tensile load, and repeated bending cycles may yield a rapid decrease in fracture strength and an increase in the number of broken wires. Therefore, it is concluded that corrosion fatigue is an important factor that decreases the life expectancy of wire rope."
"This study expands upon Steiner and Gilliland's selection fairness research. Professionals (N?=?114) from Mumbai, India rated 12 employee selection methods on favorability and provided the bases for those ratings. In line with previous research, interviews and resumes were rated most favorably, while graphology and honesty tests were rated least favorably. Perceived face validity, opportunity to perform, and widespread use of selection methods were highly correlated with favorability ratings, while interpersonal warmth, scientific evidence, and respectful of privacy exhibited weak correlations with favorability ratings. Work sample tests, which have previously been rated favorably, were rated unfavorably. Exploratory analysis showed that participants viewed assessment centers favorably and online information unfavorably. Outcome favorability was highly correlated with favorability ratings."
"Cytotoxic T-lymphocytes (CTLs) specific for tumor-associated antigens (TAAs) act in the immune surveillance system as major effector cells to eliminate malignant cells Immunization with TAA-loaded dendritic cells (DCs) has great potential for treating cancer, because DCs are potent antigen-presenting cells capable of inducing antigen-specific CTLs by the primary activation of naive T-lymphocytes The establishment of a non-cyto-toxic and efficient antigen delivery method is required to Improve the efficacy of DC-based cancer immunotherapy We developed biodegradable poly(gamma-glutamic acid) nanoparticles (gamma-PGA NPs) that can efficiently entrap various proteins as antigen delivery carriers gamma-PGA NPs efficiently delivered entrapped antigenic proteins into DCs without cytotoxicity and presented antigens to DCs via major histocompatibility complex class I and II molecules Immunization with TAA-loaded DCs using gamma-PGA NPs inhibited tumor growth by inducing TAA-specific CTLs These findings indicate that gamma-PGA NPs can function as useful antigen delivery carriers in DC-based cancer Immunotherapy"
"We examine how oil prices and exchange rates co-move using two measures of dependence: correlations and copulas and document two main findings for crude oil prices and a range of currencies: oil price exchange rate dependence is in general weak, although it rose substantially in the aftermath of the global financial crisis; and there is no extreme market dependence between oil prices and exchange rates. These findings have important implications for risk management, monetaty policies to control oil inflationary pressures or exchange rates, the dollar-pegging policies of some oil-exporting countries and fiscal policy in oil-exporting countries in general.

"Basophils are blood cells of low abundance associated with allergy, inflammation and parasite infections. To study the transcriptome of mature circulating basophils cells were purified from buffy coats by density gradient centrifugations and two-step magnetic cell sorting. However, after extensive analysis the cells were found to be transcriptionally inactive and almost completely lack functional mRNA. In order to obtain transcriptionally active immature basophils for analysis of their transcriptome, umbilical cord blood cells were therefore cultured in the presence of interleukin (IL)-3 for 9 days and basophils were enriched by removing non-basophils using magnetic cell sorting. The majority of purified cells demonstrated typical metachromatic staining with Alcian blue dye (95%) and expression of surface markers Fc epsilon RI and CD203c, indicating a pure population of cells with basophil-like phenotype. mRNA was extracted from these cells and used to construct a cDNA library with approximately 600 000 independent clones. This library served as tool to determine the mRNA frequencies for a number of hematopoietic marker proteins. It was shown that these cells express basophil/mast cell-specific transcripts, i.e. beta-tryptase, serglycin and Fc epsilon RI alpha-chain, to a relatively low degree. In contrast, the library contained a high number of several eosinophil-associated transcripts such as: major basic protein (MBP), charcot leyden crystal (CLC), eosinophil cationic protein (ECP), eosinophil derived neurotoxin (EDN) and eosinophil peroxidase (EPO). Out of these transcripts, MBP and EPO were the most frequently observed, representing 8% and 3.2% of the total mRNA pool, respectively. Moreover, in a proteome analysis of cultured basophils we identified MBP and EPO as the two most prominent protein bands, suggesting a good correlation between protein and mRNA analyses of these cells. The mixed phenotype observed for these cells strengthens the conclusion that eosinophils and basophils are closely linked during human hematopoietic development. The dual phenotype also indicates that other cytokines than IL-3 or cell surface interactions are needed to obtain the full basophil specific phenotype in vivo."
"The versatility of Ca2+ as an intracellular messenger stems largely from the impressive, but complex, spatiotemporal organization of the Ca2+ signals. For example, the latter when initiated by IP3 (inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate) in many cells manifest hierarchical recruitment of elementary Ca2+ release events ('blips' and then 'puffs') en route to global regenerative Ca2+ waves as the cellular IP3 concentration rises. The spacing of IP(3)Rs (IP3 receptors) and their regulation by Ca2+ are key determinants of these spatially organized Ca2+ signals, but neither is adequately understood. IP(3)Rs have been proposed to be pre-assembled into clusters, but their composition, geometry and whether clustering affects IP3R behaviour are unknown. Using patch-clamp recording from the outer nuclear envelope of DT40 cells expressing rat IP(3)R1 or IP(3)R3, we have recently shown that low concentrations of IP3 cause IP(3)Rs to aggregate rapidly and reversibly into small clusters of approximately four IP(3)Rs. At resting cytosolic Ca2+ concentrations, clustered IP(3)Rs open independently, but with lower open probability, shorter open duration and lesser IP3-sensitivity than lone IP(3)Rs. This inhibitory influence of clustering on IP3R is reversed when the [Ca2+](i) (cytosolic free Ca2+ concentration) increases. The gating of clustered IP(3)Rs exposed to increased [Ca2+](i) is coupled: they are more likely to open and close together, and their simultaneous openings are prolonged. Dynamic clustering of IP(3)Rs by IP3 thus exposes them to local Ca2+ rises and increases their propensity for a CICR (Ca2+ - induced Ca2+ rise), thereby facilitating hierarchical recruitment of the elementary events that underlie all IP3-evoked Ca2+ signals."
"A brief analysis of the existing definitions of the term ""coordination compound"" has been carried out and a definition that takes into account the features of this class of chemical compounds has been proposed. The existing systematic IUPAC nomenclature of coordination compounds and its possible use for constructing the names of metal complexes of different types, as well as difficulties associated with this process have been considered."
"Tannic acid, a nontoxic, easily biodegradable compound, is evaluated for scale inhibitor squeeze application in a sandstone reservoir. For this purpose, we designed a new inhibitor squeeze evaluation system, a combined core flood-tube blocking apparatus with appropriate pressure-temperature and data logging arrangement, that can simulate the near-wellbore reservoir as well as downhole locations. Berea sandstone core plugs represented the formation rock and the extended flow tube represented the wellbore. Backflow tests were conducted to measure scale precipitation within the core plug and wellbore flow restriction. A 10 pore volume (PV) tannic acid solution was squeezed through the core plug and after a 14-hr adsorption period, anion and cation brines were squeezed separately through the core plug followed by the tube. The tests were compared with a control and a commonly used phosphonate scale inhibitor. The results showed that a fast rate of permeability reduction due to scale deposition took place in the control experiment starting at the initial brine injection stage and, in the case of the phosphonate scale inhibitor squeeze, there was significant reduction in permeability due to the squeeze itself. There was also progressive reduction of permeability due to less control of scaling phenomena. However, the tannic acid-treated core showed a slight improvement in core permeability and no scale deposition took place up to 250 PV of brine injection. Scanning electron microscopy and inductively coupled plasma (ICP) studies explain the formation stimulating mechanism of this new scale inhibitor."
"Evolution curricula are replete with information about Darwin's theory of evolution as well as microevolutionary mechanisms underlying this process of change. However, other fundamental facets of evolutionary theory, particularly those related to macroevolution are often missing. One crucial idea typically overlooked is that of most recent common ancestry and its relevance for investigating evolutionary relationships among taxa. Deep understanding of most recent common ancestry is particularly important for comprehending the reciprocal concept of homoplasy (convergent evolution). This study examines knowledge of these two concepts among 127 post-secondary students as a function of their biology background. Analyses of responses to two questions indicate that students fail to acquire and/or retain knowledge of the significance of most recent common ancestry and of homoplasy, despite potential for prior exposure to them throughout K-12 and post-secondary education. These results indicate a need for improvement in evolution education to ensure that students acquire an appropriate understanding of evolutionary relationships and processes as a whole."
"This paper reflects on the medieval and classical antecedents of modern colonialism. In its first section, it focuses on Pisa's medieval experience in order to contribute to a genealogy of colonial imaginings and practice. Unable to expand inland and surrounded by hostile polities, Pisa amassed a number of colonial possessions during the eleventh and twelfth century, primarily in Sardinia, but also in the Balearic Islands, North Africa, and in the Levant. Sidestepping the findings of an important debate about whether colonial phenomena in radically different eras can be seen as continuous' with their predecessors (both sides of this debate present convincing arguments that are consistent with their respective definitions - i.e. the Ancients Greeks or Romans set up colonies', modern colonialism is entirely unprecedented'), this paper's second section refers to settler colonialism as a specific mode of domination and outlines how it was practiced in classical antiquity. Each section is followed by an epilogue touching on the intellectual afterlives of the empires' outlined by each section."
"In this paper, scanning tunneling microscope (STM) light emission (STM-LE) from alkanethiol self-assembled monolayer (SAM)-covered Au film has been probed in the Kretschmann configuration. The films were deposited on the smooth plane of a hemispherical glass prism. STM-LEs from the tip-sample gap into the vacuum (tip-side emission) and into the prism (prism-side emission) were investigated. Our experimental results showed that the tip-side emission was scarcely found, and the prism-side emissions were successfully detected due to the enhancement of Kretschmann configuration. It was also found from the experimental study that the peak intensity of STM-LE spectra become smaller, accompanying the redshift of the peak position with the rise in thickness of the alkanethiol SAM film. The main focus of this paper is to explore the behavior of electron tunneling into the SAM-covered Au film. In order to explain these phenomena, we have designed different models regarding the tip-sample gap structure. Among these models, the antenna factor successfully explains the cutoff energy shift of STM-LE spectra. According to this model, the cutoff energy shows redshift when the electronic transition occurs at the Au-S interface layer and the amount of the shift depends on the strength of the transitions."
"The European Raja clavata and the South African R. straeleni are marine skates which exhibit highly conserved morphological and ecological traits. Owing to this, taxonomic and evolutionary relationships between the two taxa have not yet fully elucidated. Here, we have tested the hypothesis that restricted gene flow and genetic divergence between these taxa might be associated with climatic/oceanographic discontinuities by surveying genetic variation in ten geographical samples at control region (CR) and amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) loci. The clustering of CR haplotypes in two reciprocally monophyletic clades consistent with taxon zoogeography and the significant AFLP F values between the European and South African populations indicated the two taxa as recently diverged peripatric sibling species. Within each species, signiWcant spatial genetic heterogeneity among samples at both markers revealed population structuring. We argued that structured populations and isolated sibling species might represent two stages of geographical speciation."
"Caring for pregnant and postpartum patients with neurological disease carries specific challenges. In performing a diagnosis, it is often difficult to differentiate between true pathology and neurological symptoms resulting from normal pregnancy physiology. Treating the pregnant patient can be problematic as well. Providers need to be aware of the possible untoward effects of maternal treatments on the developing fetus, but not withhold therapies that reduce disease-related morbidity and mortality. Given the complexities of conducting trials during pregnancy, few treatments are based on high-quality data; observational data and clinical expert opinion often guide treatments. With the exception of preeclampsia/eclampsia, neurological diseases typically do not warrant early delivery in the absence of fetal distress. Multidisciplinary care, utilizing the expertise of anesthesiology, critical care medicine, emergency medicine, maternal fetal medicine, neurology, and radiology, is essential in ensuring prompt diagnosis and treatment.

"Background: Prostate cancer is common in elderly men, especially in western countries, and incidences are rising in low-risk populations as well. In India, the age-standardized rates vary between registries. Under these circumstances we have estimated the survival of prostate cancer patients based on age, family history, diabetes, hypertension, tobacco habit, clinical extent of disease (risk group) and treatment received. Materials and Methods: The present retrospective study was carried out at the Tata Memorial Hospital (TMH), Mumbai, India. During years 1999-2002, some 850 prostate cancer cases, including 371 new cases, treated in TMH were considered as eligible entrants for the study. Five-year survival rates using actuarial and loss-adjusted (LAR) method were estimated. Results: The patient population was distributed uniformly over the three age groups. A larger proportion of the patients were diagnosed at 'metastatic stage' and hormone treatment was most common. 20% patients had history of diabetes and 40% with hypertension. The 5-year overall survival rate was 64%. Survival was 55%, 74% and 52% for `<59 years','60-69 years' and `>70 years' respectively. Non-diabetic (70%), hypertensive (74%), with family history (80%) of cancer, with localized-disease (91%) and treated with surgery, either alone or in combination, (91%) had better survival. Conclusions: The present study showed that prostate cancer patients with localized disease at diagnosis experience a better outcome. Local treatment with either surgery or radiation achieves a reasonable outcome in prostate cancer patients. A detailed study will help in understanding the prognostic indicators for survival especially with the newer treatment technologies available now."
"This work deals mechanical and tribological properties of pure copper, reinforced by various weight percentages of tin, before and after the application of equal channel angular pressing. It is found that the hardness, yield, and ultimate shear strengths are considerably improved through ECAP due to grain refinement. The effect of ECAP process on mechanical properties of dilute copper alloys is more significant than that of the pure condition. Also, the strengthening behavior is slightly intensified by increasing the amount of tin content in pure copper. Additionally, work-hardening potential of CP-Cu is restricted due to the ECAP process and also, through the production of dilute copper alloys. The results showed that the effect of ECAP on friction coefficient reduction is more sizeable than making the dilute alloys. Furthermore, the reduction of electrical conductivity in the deformed materials relies on the lattice distortion increase of copper due to the addition of Sn to Cu and the increment of dislocations density. Finally, ECAP procedure and alloying together, terminate to the better wear response of the materials."
"Objective Patients with breast cancer experience unmet informational and psychosocial needs at the end of treatment. A brief psychoeducational intervention delivered at this transition may help to address some of the challenges these women face. The purpose of this study was to test the effectiveness of a single-session group psychoeducational intervention (GBOT group) compared with standard print material (usual care). Methods In this randomized controlled trial, 442 patients with breast cancer who were completing their adjuvant radiotherapy were recruited and randomized to receive either usual care, which includes standard print material (CRL group n?=?226) or usual care and the GBOT group intervention (INT group n?=?216). Participants completed measures at baseline and again at 3 and 6?months post-intervention. Results The INT group showed significant improvement in their knowledge regarding the re-entry transition period (d?=?0.31) and in their feelings of preparedness for re-entry (d?=?0.37). There were no differences between the groups over time on health-related distress or mood. Conclusions Results support the effectiveness of providing a single-session group psychoeducational intervention as a first-step approach to supportive care for women at the end of breast cancer treatment.

"Prolactin family 7, subfamily d, member 1 (PRL7D1) is found in mouse placenta. Our recent work showed that PRL7D1 is also present in mouse testis Leydig cells, and the expression of PRL7D1 in the testis exhibits an age-related increase. In the present study, we generated transgenic mice with Leydig cell-specific PRL7D1 overexpression to explore its function during male reproduction. Prl7d1 male mice exhibited subfertility as reflected by reduced sperm counts and litter sizes. The testes from Prl7d1 transgenic mice appeared histologically normal, but the frequency of apoptotic germ cells was increased. Prl7d1 transgenic mice also had lower testosterone concentrations than wild-type mice. Mechanistic studies revealed that Prl7d1 transgenic mice have defects in the testicular expression of steroidogenic acute regulatory protein (STAR) and hydroxy-delta-5-steroid dehydrogenase, 3 beta- and steroid delta-isomerase cluster (HSD3B). Further studies revealed that PRL7D1 overexpression affected the expression of transferrin (TF) in Sertoli cells. These results suggest that PRL7D1 overexpression could lead to increased germ cell apoptosis and exert an inhibitory effect on testosterone production in Leydig cells by reducing the expression of certain steroidogenic-related genes. In addition, PRL7D1 appears to have important roles in the function of Sertoli cells, which, in turn, affects male fertility. We conclude that the expression level of PRL7D1 is associated with the reproductive function of male mice."
"Phytoplankton absorption, pigments and active fluorescence were investigated at five focus sites in a shelf region during summer and winter to elucidate the adaptation of communities to changing environmental conditions. We determined that the availability of nutrients and changing irradiance were the key drivers of phytoplankton growth and photoacclimation in an ecosystem influenced by a warm western boundary current. Diatoms dominated the communities in the winter, while mixed diatom-flagellate populations generally prevailed in summer. Prokaryotes were dominant in the surface layer at one site where warm water flowed onto the shelf. Diatom and flagellate communities were associated with cooler, lower salinity water and prokaryotes with warm, higher salinity water. Populations appeared not be nutrient stressed and actively drew down silicates and nitrates, with nitrates being rapidly utilized resulting in low ambient nitrate levels in the upper water column. The phytoplankton acclimated to changing irradiance conditions by increasing the quantum yield of photochemistry with decreasing irradiance and adjusting the absorption of light by accessory pigments. Prokaryote dominated communities had high chlorophyll-specific absorption coefficients, and a high proportion of spectral absorption by chlorophyll a and photoprotective carotenoids. Diatoms had low chlorophyll-specific absorption and elevated absorption by photosynthetic carotenoids and chlorophyll c. Although flagellate-dominated communities had intermediate chlorophyll-specific absorption, their proportion of absorption by photosynthetic carotenoids and chlorophyll c was similar to the diatoms.

"This article proposes a kinetic model for wastewater photobiotreatment with microalgae (the PhBT model). The PhBT model for nutrient uptake, coupled with the Verhulst growth model, is a simple and useful tool to describe batch experiments of nutrient removal by microalgae. The model has been validated with experiments of Chlorella vulgaris (C. vulgaris) grown in wastewater and different synthetic media. The model provided information about nitrogen and phosphorus limitation and their luxury uptake during the test. Productivity observed in synthetic medium (0.17gSSL(1)d(1)) was similar to that obtained in nutrient enriched wastewater (0.15gSSL(1)d(1)). Biomass productivity of this alga in wastewater and the efficient nutrient removal suggested that C. vulgaris could be cultured in wastewater for biomass production while nutrients are reduced from this stream."
"A basic challenge in the insulated gate bipolar transistor (IGBT) transient simulation study is to obtain the realistic junction temperature, which demands not only accurate electrical simulations but also precise thermal impedance. This paper proposed a transient thermal model for IGBT junction temperature simulations during short circuits or overloads. The updated Cauer thermal model with varying thermal parameters is obtained by means of finite-element method (FEM) thermal simulations with temperature-dependent physical parameters. The proposed method is applied to a case study of a 1700 V/1000 A IGBT module. Furthermore, a testing setup is built up to validate the simulation results, which is composed of a IGBT baseplate temperature control unit, an infrared camera with a maximum of 3 kHz sampling frequency, and a black-painted open IGBT module."

"Objective Human adult articular cartilage (AC) has little capacity for repair, and joint surface injuries often result in osteoarthritis (OA), characterised by loss of matrix, hypertrophy and chondrocyte apoptosis. Inflammation mediated by interleukin (IL)-6 family cytokines has been identified as a critical driver of proarthritic changes in mouse and human joints, resulting in a feed-forward process driving expression of matrix degrading enzymes and IL-6 itself. Here we show that signalling through glycoprotein 130 (gp130), the common receptor for IL-6 family cytokines, can have both context-specific and cytokine-specific effects on articular chondrocytes and that a small molecule gp130 modulator can bias signalling towards anti-inflammatory and antidegenerative outputs. Methods High throughput screening of 170 000 compounds identified a small molecule gp130 modulator termed regulator of cartilage growth and differentiation (RCGD 423) that promotes atypical homodimeric signalling in the absence of cytokine ligands, driving transient increases in MYC and pSTAT3 while suppressing oncostatin M-and IL-6-mediated activation of ERK and NF-kappa B via direct competition for gp130 occupancy. Results T his small molecule increased proliferation while reducing apoptosis and hypertrophic responses in adult chondrocytes in vitro. In a rat partial meniscectomy model, RCGD 423 greatly reduced chondrocyte hypertrophy, loss and degeneration while increasing chondrocyte proliferation beyond that observed in response to injury. Moreover, RCGD 423 improved cartilage healing in a rat full-thickness osteochondral defect model, increasing proliferation of mesenchymal cells in the defect and also inhibiting breakdown of cartilage matrix in de novo generated cartilage. Conclusion These results identify a novel strategy for AC remediation via small molecule-mediated modulation of gp130 signalling."
"Lattice QCD calculations with chiral fermions of the pi N sigma term sigma(pi N) and strangeness sigma term sigma(sN) including chiral interpolation with continuum and volume corrections are provided in this work, with the excited-state contaminations subtracted properly. We calculate the scalar matrix element for the light/strange quark directly and find sigma(pi N) = 45.9(7.4)(2.8) MeV, with the disconnected insertion part contributing 20(12)(4)%, and sigma(sN) = 40.2(11.7)(3.5) MeV, which is somewhat smaller than sigma(pi N). The ratio of the strange/light scalar matrix elements is y = 0.09(3)(1)."
"Background Lyme carditis (LC), an early manifestation of Lyme disease that most commonly presents as high-degree atrioventricular block (AVB), usually resolves with antibiotic treatment. When LC is not identified as the cause of AVB, a permanent pacemaker may be inappropriately implanted in a reversible cardiac conduction disorder. Hypothesis The likelihood that a patient's high-degree AVB is caused by LC can be evaluated by clinical characteristics incorporated into a risk stratification tool. Methods A systematic review of all published cases of LC with high-degree AVB, and five cases from the authors' experience, was conducted. The results informed the development of a new risk stratification tool, the Suspicious Index in LC (SILC) score. The SILC score was then applied to each case included in the review. Results Of the 88 cases included, 51 (58%) were high-risk, 31 (35.2%) intermediate-risk, and 6 (6.8%) low-risk for LC according to the SILC score (sensitivity 93.2%). For the subset of 32 cases that reported on all SILC variables, 24 (75%) cases were classified as high-risk, 8 (25%) intermediate-risk, and 0 low-risk (sensitivity 100%). Specificity could not be assessed (no control group). Notably, 6 of the 11 patients who received permanent pacemakers had reversal of AVB with antibiotic treatment. Conclusion The SILC risk score and COSTAR mnemonic (constitutional symptoms; outdoor activity; sex = male; tick bite; age < 50; rash = erythema migrans) may help to identify LC in patients presenting with high-degree AVB, and ultimately, minimize the implantation of unnecessary permanent pacemakers."
"Pyroligneous acids, i.e. by-products from the manufacture of charcoal by carbonisation of Eucalyptus camaldulensis, Leucaena leucocephala, Azadirachta indica, Hevea brasiliensis (rubberwood) and Dendrocalamus asper (bamboo) along with two commercial products were studied. Characterisations of their compositions were performed qualitatively by gas chromatography-mass spectroscopy and quantitatively by gas chromatography with flame ionisation detector. Twenty-three components were identified, of which acetic acid was the major component, followed by 2-methoxy-4-propylphenol and 2-methylphenol. Antifungal activity and efficacy of pyroligneous acids as wood preservatives were conducted using Petri dish bioassay and soil block test respectively against two white rot fungi (Trametes versicolor and Rigidoporopsis amylospora), a brown rot fungus (Gloeophyllum trabeum) and a sapstain fungus (Botryodiplodia theobromae). All pyroligneous acids exhibited antifungal activity (growth inhibition, minimum inhibitory concentration and minimum fungicidal concentration) especially those from bamboo and rubberwood, which had higher total phenolic concentrations. Soil block experiments for 12 weeks showed that pyroligneous acids from bamboo and rubberwood were more effective as wood preservatives."
"Inclusive fitness theory predicts that cannibalism should be more likely to arise if close relatives can be avoided, suggesting that cannibalistic species will possess mechanisms for minimizing predation on kin. Juvenile Miomantis caffra are good candidates for the possession of such traits because; (1) groups of siblings hatch together into the same locale, (2) they are aggressive hunters, and (3) they are strongly cannibalistic. In this study, the possibility of kin recognition or avoidance in M. caffra is investigated by laboratory comparison of cannibalism rates between groups of differing relatedness. In order to examine the likelihood of encounters between early instar siblings, the extent of dispersal away from the ootheca in the days following hatching is also observed. Nymphs did not rapidly disperse after hatching, so the chances of full siblings encountering one another in the wild appear to be high. Despite this, cannibalism was equally high in groups of full siblings and groups of mixed parenthood. We suggest that for M. caffra, a generalist ambush predator, the benefits of indiscriminate aggression may outweigh any inclusive fitness benefits that would be gained from kin discrimination."
"Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a chronic autoimmune disease characterized by activation and proliferation of autoreactive T cells and B cells. We examined changes in cell cycle progression of T cells from MRL/lpr mice with or without allogenic bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMMSCs) treatment and analyzed the expression of cell cycle associated proteins. In addition, the Akt/GSK3 beta protein kinase cascade was studied. We demonstrated that high-dose MSCs transplantation effectively ameliorated disease activity in MRL/lpr mice. BMMSCs treatment inhibited G1/S transition of the abnormal lupus T lymphocytes. Moreover, it increased the expression of p21(WAF1/CIP1) and p27(Kip1) and decreased the expression of CDK2. Furthermore, high-dose MSCs inhibited abnormal activation of the Akt/GSK3 beta signaling pathway of T cells from MRL/lpr mice. Our results suggest that high-dose BMMSCs transplantation successfully treated MRL/lpr lupus mice by inhibiting abnormal activation of Akt/GSK3 beta signaling pathway of T cells.

"Background: For an effective colorectal cancer (CRC) screening program, high participation rate is essential. However, non-participation in CRC screening program has increased in Finland.Material and methods: The study was based on a population-based nationwide cohort of persons invited for CRC screening in 2004-2011. Information on the first round of the CRC screening participation and related background factors was obtained from the Finnish Cancer Registry, and information about health behavior factors from the Health Behavior Survey (HBS) in 1978-1999. Non-participation in CRC screening was analyzed with Poisson regression as incidence rate ratios (IRR) with 95% confidence intervals (95% CI).Results: Of all persons invited for CRC screening (79 871 men and 80 891 women) 35% of men and 21% of women refused. Of those invited for screening, 2456 men (3.1%) and 2507 women (3.1%) were also invited to the HBS. Persons, who declined HBS, were also more likely to refuse CRC screening (men IRR 1.40, 95% CI 1.26-1.56, women 1.75, 1.52-2.02) compared to HBS participants. Never married persons had about a 75% higher risk for refusing than married ones. The youngest age group (60 years) was more likely to refuse screening than the older age groups (62 or>64 years). Smoking was associated with non-participation in screening (current smokers, men: IRR 1.32, 95% CI 1.05-1.67, women: 2.10, 1.61-2.73).Conclusions: Participation in CRC screening was affected by gender, age, and marital status. Persons, who refused the HBS, were also more likely to refuse CRC screening. Smoking was a risk factor for non-participation in CRC screening."

Cardiogoniometry (CGM) is a spatio-temporal five-lead resting electrocardiographic method utilizing automated analysis. The purpose of this study was to determine CGMs and electrocardiography (ECG)s accuracy for detecting myocardial ischaemia and/or lesions in comparison with perfusion cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMRI) and late gadolinium enhancement (LGE). Forty (n 40) patients with suspected or known stable coronary artery disease were examined by CGM and resting ECG directly prior to CMRI including adenosine stress perfusion (ASP) and LGE. The investigators visually reading the CMRI were blinded to the CGM and ECG results. Half of the patients (n 20) had a normal CMRI while the other half presented with either abnormal ASP and/or detectable LGE. Cardiogoniometry yielded an accuracy of 83 (sensitivity 70) and ECG of 63 (sensitivity 35) compared with CMRI. In this pilot study CGM compares more favourably than ECG with the detection of ischaemia and/or structural myocardial lesions on CMRI.
"The Reisman Diagnostic Creativity Assessment (RDCA) is a free online self-report creativity assessment that provides immediate feedback to the user and is diagnostic, rather than predictive, with the focus on making the user aware of creative strengths and weaknesses. Several engineering and teacher education studies have included the RDCA over a period of 3 years to refine the document items as a result of factor and statistical analyses. We acknowledge the advantages and disadvantages of self-report instruments and question the traditional use of reliability as a psychometric measure for self-report assessments. Many tools and techniques for enhancing creative factors identified by the RDCA are included."
"Paraserianthes falcataria is fast growing species that considered being potential lumber for construction application. The aim was to evaluate the effect of year rotation of harvesting on quality of Paraserianthes falcataria wood for construction application. Nine trees of Paraserianthes falcataria with harvesting rotation of 5, 7, and 9 years, were harvested from the private forest. Moisture content, specific gravity, shrinkage, MOE, MOR, and compressive strength parallel to grain were measured for wood quality parameters in accordance to JIS Z 2101. Durability test were conducted against dry wood termite (Criptotermes cynocephalus Light). The results showed that year harvesting of Paraserianthes falcataria influence significantly on specific gravity, and compressive strength parallels to grain. Paraserianthes falcataria wood is classified into strength class III-IV, which is properly used for light construction. TO obtain optimum quality for construction purposes, Paraserianthes falcataria tree is recommended to be harvested in minimum harvesting rotation of 7 years."
"In this paper, a bee colony optimization (BCO) algorithm is adapted to the current control strategy of power factor (PF) correction for a Sheppard-Taylor converter. The control approach is developed to eliminate the input current harmonics in the converter. The BCO algorithm is a new population-based search algorithm which is one of the metaheuristic techniques based on swarm intelligence. This algorithm depends on modeling the natural behavior of real honey bees. In this approach, duty cycles are generated by the BCO algorithm for the Sheppard-Taylor converter switch to obtain unity PF (UPF) and lower total harmonic distortion of the input current. The duty cycles for half a line period are calculated and stored in a lookup table. By synchronizing the memory with the line, near-unity PFs can be achieved in an operating point. The feedforward is also used into the control algorithm with the maximum value of the input voltage. The implementation of feedforward improves the converter performance. The input current of the converter is operated in continuous conduction mode. The simulation and experimental results show that the proposed control strategy works well and the UPF can be achieved with wide input voltage, load, and parameter variation.

The chimpanzee had previously learned to associate specific visuo-graphic symbols called lexigrams with real world referents and the spoken English words and photographs for those referents. On some trials, an unknown spoken English word was presented as the sample, and the match choices could consist of photographs or lexigrams that already were associated with known English words as well as unknown lexigrams or photos of objects without associated lexigrams. The chimpanzee reliably avoided choosing known comparisons for these unknown samples, instead relying on exclusion to choose comparisons that were of unknown lexigrams or photographs of items without associated lexigram symbols.

"We have developed a simple approach for the preparation of carbon nanodots (C-dots) from coffee grounds. As-prepared C-dots have an average diameter of 5 +/- 2 nm, of which quantum yield is 3.8%. We have validated the practicality of C-dots for cell imaging and surface-assisted laser desorption/ionization-mass spectrometry (SALDI-MS) of angiotensin I and insulin."
"A family of unsupported NiMoW sulfide catalysts have been prepared by thermal decomposition of mechanically ground tetramethylammonium thiomolybdotungstate and Ni(NO3)(2) for hydrodesulfurization of dibenzothiophene. The materials were characterized by Fourier transformation infrared spectroscopy. ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy, thermogravimetric analysis, X-ray diffraction, N-2 physorption, scanning electron microscopy, and transmission electron microscopy. The results showed that structures and properties of unsupported NiMoW sulfides depend on nickel content and decomposition condition. XRD revealed a decrease in the stacking along the c direction of the MoS2 and/or WS2 crystalline structures as the nickel content was increased, consistent with a higher dispersion of the metal sulfides observed by electron microscopy. The low nickel content in Ni0.5MoWSy catalyst gave a positive effect on the hydrodesulfurization of dibenzothiophene, as indicated by the greatly increased specific catalytic activity per unit surface area. In contrast, the high nickel content in Ni1.5MoWSy catalyst showed a negative effect due to the formation of nickel sulfides. Ni0.5MoWSy catalyst showed the highest activity in the hydrodesulfurization reaction compared to other samples. The results further suggest that unsupported NiMoW sulfide catalysts may be promising candidates for wide application in hydrotreating of fuel oil. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."

"Diffusion of molecules in the crowded and charged interior of the cell has long been of interest for understanding cellular processes. Here, we introduce a model system of hindered diffusion that includes both crowding and binding. In particular, we obtained the diffusivity of the positively charged protein, ribonuclease A (RNase), in solutions of dextrans of various charges (binding) and concentrations (crowding), as well as combinations of both, in a buffer of physiological ionic strength. Using fluorescence correlation spectroscopy, we observed that the diffusivity of RNase was unaffected by the presence of positively charged or neutral dextrans in the dilute regime but was affected by crowding at higher polymer concentrations. Conversely, protein diffusivity was significantly reduced by negatively charged dextrans, even at 0.4 mu M (0.02% w/v) dextran. The diffusivity of RNase decreased with increasing concentrations of negative dextran, and the amount of bound RNase increased until it reached a plateau of similar to 80% bound RNase. High salt concentrations were used to establish the electrostatic nature of the binding. Binding of RNase to the negatively charged dextrans was further confirmed by ultrafiltration."
"Capsaicin is a neurotoxin selective for C- and A delta-type neurons. Systemic treatment with capsaicin is known to reduce this subpopulation in the dorsal root ganglia (DRG) of neonatal rats. To better understand the effects of capsaicin on adult afferent fibers, we examined DRG neurons retrogradely labeled by an i.p. injection of Fast Blue (FB) administered 3, 30, or 60 days after systemic capsaicin treatment (125 mg/kg i.p.). FB labeling in the 12th and 13th thoracic DRG was dramatically reduced 3 and 30 days post capsaicin (50% and 35% of control, respectively). However, the number of retrogradely labeled neurons rose to 65% of control by 60 days post capsaicin. In addition to FB labeling, we quantified the immunoreactivity of NR1, the obligatory N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor subunit, and Na(v)1.8, a DRG-specific sodium channel, in FB-labeled neurons as well as mRNA levels for both proteins in the 5th and 6th lumbar DRG. NR1 immunoreactivity and mRNA expression followed a pattern of early reduction and subsequent partial restoration similar to FB labeling. Na(v)1.8 immunoreactivity and mRNA expression dropped to approximately 50% of control at 3 days post capsaicin but completely recovered by 60 days. These data strongly support the conclusion that restoration of spinal afferent projections and signaling occurs in adult rats following capsaicin-induced damage. J. Comp. Neurol. 518:3529-3540, 2010.

"PURPOSE. To evaluate the psychometric properties of the Greek National Eye Institute Refractive Error Quality of Life Questionnaire (NEI-RQL-42). METHODS. We developed the Greek version of the instrument using forward and backward translation. To examine reliability, Cronbach alpha for each subscale was used as an index of internal consistency. Test-retest reliability was evaluated with intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC). Regarding construct validity, both convergent and discriminant validities were calculated by means of multi-trait analysis. Furthermore, the instrument was evaluated by Rasch analysis, as well. RESULTS. Three patient groups were studied (emmetropes (n=20), myopes (n=41), and hyperopes (n=18)). Emmetropes scored significantly better in the majority of subscales, while myopes scored better than hyperopes in clarity of vision (p=0.012), near vision (p < 0.001), and satisfaction with correction (p=0.001). Cronbach alpha ranged from 0.490 (glare) to 0.948 (expectations), with most subscales having high internal consistency. The ICCs ranged from 0.76 to 0.93 for all subscales. All items passed the convergent and discriminant validity tests. Strong correlations were detected between uncorrected visual acuity and near vision, expectations, activity limitations, dependence on correction, worry, and suboptimal correction subscales. Rasch analysis revealed potential weaknesses of the instrument that are associated with the assumptions of the model itself. Specifically, 3 items and 17.5% of the participants fell outside the tolerance box. Moreover, principal component analysis indicated average unidimensionality for the instrument. CONCLUSIONS. Traditional validation methods indicate that the Greek NEI-RQL-42 scale has adequate psychometric properties for comparative studies in local populations. Rasch analysis indicates significant misfits to the model that should be taken into consideration and evaluated in future studies. These misfits might reflect inherent weaknesses of the original NEI-RQL-42 and not of its adaptation to Greek norms."
"We explicitly (in terms of Langlands parameters) describe the image of the degenerate Eisenstein series in the case of a symplectic group. We study these series for any maximal parabolic subgroup and any Grossencharacter. We do that by an explicit analysis of the constant term of the Eisenstein series. Using already available information on the constituents of the local degenerate principal series, we further analyze the action of the local intertwining operators and determine their images. The local components of the images are given explicitly, in terms of their Langlands parameters. In this way, we have a complete description of the images of Eisenstein series in the right half-plane, for any Grossencharacter of the adeles over Thus, we complete previously known results obtained by different techniques for the trivial character and extend them to the case of the non-trivial characters."
"Let A be a real skew-symmetric Gaussian random matrix whose upper triangular elements are independently distributed according to the standard normal distribution. We provide the distribution of the largest singular value sigma 1 of A. Moreover, by acknowledging the fact that the largest singular value can be regarded as the maximum of a Gaussian field, we deduce the distribution of the standardized largest singular value [image omitted]. These distributional results are utilized in Scheffe's paired comparisons model. We propose tests for the hypothesis of subtractivity based on the largest singular value of the skew-symmetric residual matrix. Professional baseball league data are analyzed as an illustrative example."
"Purpose: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the role of involved-lesion radiation therapy (ILRT) after rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone (R-CHOP) chemotherapy in limited stage diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) by comparing outcomes of R-CHOP therapy alone with R-CHOP followed by ILRT. Methods and Materials: We identified 198 patients treated with R-CHOP (median, 6 cycles) for pathologically confirmed DLBCL of limited stage from July 2004 to December 2012. Clinical characteristics of these patients were 33% with stage I and 66.7% with stage II; 79.8% were in the low or low-intermediate risk group; 13.6% had B symptoms; 29.8% had bulky tumors (>= 7 cm); and 75.3% underwent >= 6 cycles of R-CHOP therapy. RT was given to 43 patients (21.7%) using ILRT technique, which included the prechemotherapy tumor volume with a median margin of 2 cm (median RT dose: 36 Gy). Results: After a median follow-up of 40 months, 3-year progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were 85.8% and 88.9%, respectively. Multivariate analysis showed >= 6 cycles of R-CHOP (PFS, P = .004; OS, P = .004) and ILRT (PFS, P = .021; OS, P = .014) were favorable prognosticators of PFS and OS. A bulky tumor (P = .027) and response to R-CHOP (P = .012) were also found to be independent factors of OS. In subgroup analysis, the effect of ILRT was prominent in patients with a bulky tumor (PFS, P = .014; OS, P = .030) or an elevated level of serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH; PFS, P = .004; OS, P = .012). Conclusions: Our results suggest that ILRT after R-CHOP therapy improves PFS and OS in patients with limited stage DLBCL, especially in those with bulky disease or an elevated serum LDH level.

"This research presents Koppen-Geiger (K-G) climate type maps of the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) of 21,000 years ago (21 ka), the mid-Holocene (MH) of 6 ka, and the present (1976-2005). Data used to calculate and map the K-G climate type are-year monthly mean 2-m air temperature and precipitation from the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) Community Climate System Model version 4 (CCSM4) Community Atmosphere Model version 4 (CAM4) as part of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5). Results suggest that the model depicts similar modern climate distributions as in data-based research, excepting a larger distribution of tropical wet-dry and humid subtropical types, and a smaller distribution of hot arid and hot semi-arid types. The modeled modern K-G climate types cover similar percentages of Earth's terrestrial and marine surface as during the MH, with slight enlargement of the tropical wet-dry and decreased area of mesothermal monsoonal hot summer type in the modern period. At the LGM, the K-G Polar (E) climate was far more extensive than in modern times, with concurrent decreases in area of the Tropical (A) climates. Because Koppen-type classifications are intended to mimic the biome distributions, these results may be helpful in identifying biotic realms from the geologic past and the potential vegetative response to future climate changes.

"Solid-on-liquid deposition (SOLID) techniques are of great interest to the MEMS and NEMS (Micro- and Nano Electro Mechanical Systems) community because of potential applications in biomedical engineering, on-chip liquid trapping, tunable micro-lenses, and replacements of gate oxides. However, depositing solids on liquid with subsequent hermetic sealing is difficult because liquids tend to have a lower density than solids. Furthermore, current systems seen in nature lack thermal, mechanical or chemical stability. Therefore, it is not surprising that liquids are not ubiquitous as functional layers in MEMS and NEMS. However, SOLID techniques have the potential to be harnessed and controlled for such systems because the gravitational force is negligible compared to surface tension, and therefore, the solid molecular precursors that typically condense on a liquid surface will not sediment into the fluid. In this review we summarize recent research into SOLID, where nucleation and subsequent cross-linking of solid precursors results in thin film growth on a liquid substrate. We describe a large variety of thin film deposition techniques such as thermal evaporation, sputtering, plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition used to coat liquid substrates. Surprisingly, all attempts at deposition to date have been successful and a stable solid layer on a liquid can always be detected. However, all layers grown by non-equilibrium deposition processes showed a strong presence of wrinkles, presumably due to residual stress. In fact, the only example where no stress was observed is the deposition of parylene layers (poly-para-xylylene, PPX). Using all the experimental data analyzed to date we have been able to propose a simple model that predicts that the surface property of liquids at molecular level is influenced by cohesion forces between the liquid molecules. Finally, we conclude that the condensation of precursors from the gas phase is rather the rule and not the exception for SOLID techniques. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V."
"The purpose of this study is to examine the origin, development, and characteristics of terraces (kella), plus their potentials and determinants for sustainable use in the Chencha-Dorze Belle area of southern Ethiopia. Field surveys were conducted to determine the various parameters of the indigenous terraces and in order to collect samples for radiocarbon dating. To identify farmers' views of the terrace systems, semi-structured interviews and group discussions were also carried out. Terraces were built and used-as radiocarbon dating proves-at least over the last 800 years. The long-term continued usage of the indigenous terraces is the result of social commitments, the structural features of the terraces, and the farmers' responses to the dynamics of social and cultural circumstances. We dubbed that the terraces are a success story of fruitful environmental management over generations. Thus, a strong need is to preserve and develop this important cultural heritage and example of sustainable land use."
"We consider the Landau-Kolmogorov problem on a finite interval which is to find an exact bound for parallel to f((k))parallel to, for 0 < k < n, given bounds parallel to f parallel to <= 1 and parallel to f((n))parallel to <= sigma, with parallel to . parallel to being the max-norm on inverted right perpendicular1; 1inverted left perpendicular. In 1972, Karlin conjectured that this bound is attained at the end-point of the interval by a certain Zolotarev polynomial or spline, and that was proved for a number of particular values of n or sigma. Here, we provide a complete proof of this conjecture in the polynomial case, i.e. for 0 <= sigma <= sigma(n) := parallel to T-n((n))parallel to, where T-n is the Chebyshev polynomial of degree n. In addition, we prove a certain Schur-type estimate which is of independent interest."
"Nerve damage often leads to nervous system dysfunction and neuropathic pain. The serine-threonine kinases receptor-interacting protein 1 (RIP1) and 3 (RIP3) are associated with inflammation and cell necrosis. This study aimed to explore the role of RIP1 and RIP3 in sciatic nerve chronic constriction injury (CCI) in mice. On a total of thirty mice, sciatic nerve CCI was performed. The paw withdrawal threshold was measured using Von Frey filaments. The mRNA expression and protein levels of inflammatory factors RIP1 and RIP3 in the dorsal root ganglion (DRG), spinal cord (SC) and hippocampus (HIP) were also determined. We found that paw withdrawal threshold was significantly reduced from the second day after the operation, and the levels of tumour necrosis factor- and interferon- in DRG, SC and HIP were significantly increased on the eighth and 14th days in CCI mice. Furthermore, the downstream signalling molecules of RIP1 and RIP3, GTPase dynamin-related protein-1, NLR family pyrin domain containing-3 (NLRP3) and nuclear factor B-p65 were upregulated. Increased protein levels of programmed cell death protein 1, which indicate cell death of peripheral and central nervous tissue, were induced by CCI of the sciatic nerve. Overall, this study showed that RIP1 and RIP3 were highly expressed in DRG, SC and HIP of the sciatic nerve in CCI mice and may be involved in chronic neuroinflammation and neuronecrosis."
"Taffy is a popular food form for delivery of functional ingredients but requires formulation that delivers acceptable flavor and texture throughout the entire product consumption experience. Because consumer-relevant flavor and texture changes occur throughout the mastication process for this type of product, it is useful to apply a sensory time-intensity methodology during chew-down for product optimization. Classical time-intensity methods are not efficient approaches for rapid development timelines as they are generally limited to single attributes per run. A multi-attribute time-intensity (MATI) application has been developed and applied to 'pace' respondents through multiple attributes and cycles within a run, thereby offering an efficient means to capture key flavor and texture attributes over time. MATI is a natural extension of the classical time-intensity methodology, from one attribute to multiple attributes and from intensity attributes to both intensity and hedonic attributes. Many advanced statistical techniques can be used for analyzing the MATI data. The techniques include turning raw discrete data into smooth MATI curves; the bootstrap method for estimations of the parameters of MATI curves and the standard errors of the estimators; HANOVA, an adaptive analysis of variance for high-dimensional data, for comparisons of groups of MATI curves; and the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) and multivariate intraclass correlation coefficient (MICC) for assessing performance of a panel and panelists. A combination of MATI results from a trained sensory descriptive panel and consumers was used to deliver product category understanding, provide detailed understanding of what flavors and textures consumers enjoy and formulation optimization guidance.

"The feeding habits, the sexual dimorphism in size and sexual maturity of the actively foraging lizard Cnemidophorus ocellifer were analysed in an area of a reforested Restinga habitat located in the municipality of Mataraca, along the northern-most coast of Paraiba State, Brazil. Seventy-five specimens of C. ocellifer were examined (46 males and 29 females). Of this total, only 23 specimens had prey in their stomachs. The most frequent prey consumed items were orthopterans (50%), coleopterans (23.9%) and arachnids (10.9%); termites and insect larvae were less consumed (both with 2.2%). There were no significant differences observed between the numbers of prey consumed by either males or females. There were significant differences in SVL (snout-vent length) between the sexes, with males attaining larger SVL values. When the influence of SVL was removed from the analyses, sexual dimorphism in the form was still reflected in the head size of these lizards. Sexual maturity in females and males was attained with SVL of 42.2 and 49.0 mm respectively. Although no significant difference was observed between the SVL of the females and the number of eggs produced, there was a clear tendency for larger females to produce more eggs. The low structural complexity of the vegetation and the poor soil quality in the reforested restinga area examined does not furnish favourable habitat for insect and termite larvae, contributing to the marked differences in the diet of the population of C. ocellifer observed in the present study in relation to the diet of their conspecifics in undisturbed areas of restinga. cerrado and caatinga."

"Objectives: Among women requesting pregnancy termination, we studied the proportion of women who reported having used contraception when they became pregnant and the contraceptive method that they had used. Study design: We included all requests for pregnancy termination in Norway during the years 2007-2011 (n=80,346) by obtaining information from the Norwegian Registry of Pregnancy Termination. By using a logistic regression model, we estimated odds ratios for using any contraceptive method associated with the woman's age, previous childbirth, previous pregnancy termination, marital status, employment status and educational level. Results: In total, 36.5% of the women who requested pregnancy termination (29,305/80,346) reported having used contraception when they became pregnant. Of all women, 16.6% reported having used the combined contraceptive pill/progestin pill, 11.5% the condom and 1.1% long-acting reversible contraceptives (1.0% intrauterine contraception). Overall, 38.9% of women 20-24 years old had used contraception, compared to 29.9% of women 40-44 years old (odds ratio 0.55, 95% confidence interval 0.51-0.60). Previous childbirth, previous pregnancy termination and high educational level were also associated with contraceptive use. Conclusion: Among women who requested pregnancy termination in Norway, 36.5% reported having used contraception when they became pregnant. Contraception use was associated with young age and having previously been pregnant. Implications: A large proportion of women who request pregnancy termination have experienced contraceptive failure. Women who are fertile and do not wish to become pregnant should be offered a contraceptive method that carries low risk of incorrect use. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved."

"Novel near-UV and blue excited Eu3+, Tb3+-codoped one dimensional strontium germanate full-color nano-phosphors have been successfully synthesized by a simple sol-hydrothermal method. The morphologies, internal structures, chemical constitution and optical properties of the resulting samples were characterized using FE-SEM, TEM, HRTEM, EDS, XRD, FTIR, XPS, PL and PLE spectroscopy and luminescence decay curves. The results suggested that the obtained Eu3+, Tb3+-codoped strontium germanate nanowires are single crystal nanowires with a diameter ranging from 10 to 80 nm, average diameter of around 30 nm and the length ranging from tens to hundreds micrometers. The results of PL and PLE spectra indicated that the Eu3+, Tb3+-codoped single crystal strontium germanate nanowires showed an intensive blue, blue-green, green, orange and red or green, orange and red light emission under excitation at 350-380 nm and 485 nm, respectively, which may attributed to the coexistent Eu3+, Eu2+ and Tb3+ ions, and the defects located in the strontium germanate nanowires. A possible mechanism of energy transfer among the host, Eu3+ and Tb3+ ions was proposed. White-emission can be realized in a single-phase strontium germanate nanowire host by codoping with Tb3+ and Eu3+ ions. The Eu3+, Tb3+-codoped one-dimensional strontium germanate full-color nano-phosphors have superior stability under electron bombardment. Because of their strong PL intensity, good CIE chromaticity and stability, the novel 1D strontium germanate full-color nano-phosphors have potential applications in W-LEDs."
"In this paper, a comparison is made on different torque vectoring strategies to find the best strategy in terms of improving handling, fuel consumption, stability and ride comfort performances. The torque vectoring differential strategies include superposition clutch, stationary clutch, four-wheel drive and electronic stability control. The torque vectoring differentials are implemented on an eight-DOF vehicle model and controlled using optimized fuzzy-based controllers. The vehicle model assisted with the Pacejka tyre model, an eight-cylinder dynamic model for engine, and a five-speed transmission system. Bee's Algorithm is employed to optimize the fuzzy controller to ensure each torque vectoring differential works in its best state. The controller actuates the electronic clutches of the torque vectoring differential to minimize the yaw rate error and limiting the side-slip angle in stability region. To estimate side-slip angle and cornering stiffness, a combined observer is designed based on full order observer and recursive least square method. To validate the results, a realistic car model is built in Carsim package. The final model is tested using a co-simulation between Matlab and Carsim. According to the results, the torque vectoring differential shows better handling compared to electronic stability control, while electronic stability control is more effective in improving the stability in critical situation. Among the torque vectoring differential strategies, stationary clutch in handling and four-wheel drive in fuel consumption as well as ride comfort have better operation and more enhancements."
"We tested if pelagic crustaceans of the genus Daphnia use different anti-predator defences in environmental conditions that do or do not offer deep refuge from planktivorous fish. We kept Daphnia catawba in two series of 9-m deep enclosures with and without caged cyprinid fish Phoxinus eos. In one series of enclosures, Daphnia could select its depth of residence and hide in deep dark water layers to avoid anticipated fish predation, while in another series of enclosures, a plankton net barrier fixed at 2-m depth forced them to stay in subsurface zone exposed to fish kairomones. We compared depth residence and migratory behaviour strategies with life history strategies (body size and size at first reproduction, diapause induction) in Daphnia exposed or not to fish kairomones with or without deep refuge. In deep enclosures with fish, Daphnia spent daytime hours in deep dark layers while at night, they resided closer to the water surface. Yet, no change in life history parameters of migrating individuals was observed compared to the fish-free conditions. In enclosures with fish, where the net barrier forced Daphnia to reside in subsurface zone, they produced smaller offspring, matured at smaller size and achieved lower maximum body length compared to the fish-free conditions. However, they did not produce diapausing eggs. Our experimental study supports the hypothesis that diel vertical migration behaviour with daytime residence in deep, dark water are the preferred antipredator strategy chosen by Daphnia facing anticipated fish predation over life history changes such as reduced size and low growth rate which are used when dark deep refuge is not present or accessible."
"The study of nonindicated medications on cancer outcomes is challenged by potential time-related biases. The literature has strongly advocated for treating the exposure as time-varying and summarizing the outcomes through a dose-response model (an etiologic-focused analysis). An alternative is to refashion the data to resemble a hypothetical randomized trial of drug-use (an action-focused analysis). To our knowledge, their relative treatment of time-related bias and aspects of interpretation have not been compared. In this commentary, using the study of metformin use on colorectal cancer risk by Bradley and collea-gues (2018) as motivation, we compare the etiologic versus action-focused analysis of epidemiologic data. We examine their treatment of immortal person-time, time-varying confounding, selection bias, and the biological and clinical relevance of their results. In doing so, we aim to establish areas of common ground and points of departure that can guide future observational studies of medications on cancer risk, recurrence, and survival.

"Background: The Low Temperature Days (LTD) have attracted far less attention than that of High Temperature Days (HTD), though its impact on mortality is at least comparable. This lower degree of attention may perhaps be due to the fact that its influence on mortality is less pronounced and longer-term, and that there are other concomitant infectious winters factors. In a climate-change scenario, the studies undertaken to date report differing results. The aim of this study was to analyse mortality attributable to both thermal extremes in Spain's 52 provinces across the period 2000-2009, and estimate the related economic cost to show the benefit or ""profitability"" of implementing prevention plans against LID. Methods: Previous studies enabled us: to obtain the maximum daily temperature above which HTD occurred and the minimum daily temperature below which LTD occurred in the 52 provincial capitals analysed across the same study period; and to calculate the relative and attributable risks (%) associated with daily mortality in each capital. These measures of association were then used to make different calculations to obtain the daily mean mortality attributable to both thermal extremes. To this end, we obtained a summary of the number of degrees whereby the temperature exceeded (excess degrees C) or fell short (deficit degrees C) of the threshold temperature for each capital, and calculated the respective number of extreme temperatures days. The economic estimates rated the prevention plans as being 68% effective. Results: Over the period considered, the number of HTD (4373) was higher than the number of LTD (3006) for Spain as a whole. Notwithstanding this, in every provincial capital the mean daily mortality attributable to heat was lower (3 deaths/day) than that attributable to cold (3.48 deaths/day). In terms of the economic impact of the activation of prevention plans against LTD, these could be assumed to avoid 2.37 deaths on each LTD, which translated as a saving of (sic)0.29M. Similarly, in the case of heat, 2.04 deaths could be assumed to be avoided each day on which the prevention plan against HTD was activated, amounting to a saving of (sic)0.25M. While the economic cost of cold-related mortality across the ten-year period 2000-2009 was (sic)871.7M; that attributable to heat could be put at (sic)1093.2M. Conclusion: The effect of extreme temperatures on daily mortality was similar across the study period for Spain overall. The lower number of days with LTD meant, however, that daily cold-related mortality was higher than daily heat-related mortality, thereby making prevention plans against LTD more ""profitable"" prevention plans against HID in terms of avoidable mortality.

"This paper aims to elaborate a local energy management and coordinated control of a 15 kW Standalone Active PV Generator (SAAPG), dedicated to the electrical supply of a remote farm in southern Algeria. The SAAPG is composed of four sources: Photovoltaics, Lead Acid Batteries, Ultra-capacitors, and Diesel generators (DGs); all these sources are coupled together in the DC-link (VDC-ref = 700 V). This agricultural area is mainly equipped with unpredictable high dynamic (transient) loads composed of two cold room compressors, an immersed pump and a watering pump. Unlike usual, a DC side coupling structure of the DG is proposed in this paper in order to ensure two dominant advantages: the first one is to slow the dynamics of the DG output power, which will be imposed by the DG boost converter instead of the load (like AC side coupling), allowing a low maintenance frequency in the diesel engine by reducing thermo-mechanical stresses in diesel engine cylinder heads due to transients. The second one guarantees both efficiency and cost effectiveness of the system by operating the DG near to its rated power in either transient or steady state conditions, and thus, such an oversizing of the DG will be avoided unlike the AC coupling case. The four power sources are managed in coordination, according to their dynamics, to maintain the DC-link voltage value regulated around its reference. A three-phase DC-AC PWM converter operates independently considering the DC link as a fixed DC source voltage in order to power supply AC loads. Published under license by AIP Publishing."
"The onset of maternal responsiveness and the development of mother-young attachment in sheep are under the combined influence of hormonal and sensory stimulations. In the mother, the prepartum rise in oestrogen and vaginocervical stimulation caused by expulsion of the foetus act on the main olfactory system and on hypothalamic regions. This induces maternal care through the central release of oxytocin, modulated by opiates and corticotrophin-releasing hormone. In parallel, activation of the main olfactory network enables the learning of individual lamb odour and maternal attachment. In the neonate, the first suckling episodes and the concomitant activation of the cholecystokinin, opioids and oxytocin systems facilitate the development of a preference for the mother. Gastrointestinal signals activate the brain stem, the hypothalamus and the amygdala. Within 72 h of parturition, the mother-young attachment shifts from proximal to distal recognition based on visual and auditory cues after which vocal cues become more salient. Although olfaction remains a key element in the display of selective maternal nursing, maternal attachment relies on a multisensory mental image of the lamb. These findings support the view that sheep are amongst the most appropriate animal models for the study of maternal and filial attachment in mammals."

In this study, micronsized polystyrene beads containing immobilized thiourea (mTA-PS) were prepared through suspension polymerization and two successive chemical modifications. The sorbent was stable even at pH of 0 under room temperature. The effects of pH, contact time, and initial concentration on sorption of Cr(VI) anions were studied. The isotherm data was fitted to the Freundlich model accordingly. The Langmuir model predicted the sorbent to have a maximum sorption capacity of 137 mg g(-1) at pH 1. The sorbent exhibited a significant selective sorption of Cr(VI) ions over trivalent chromium (Cr(III)) ions. These results show that such polymer sorbent can be utilized to remove Cr(VI) ions from a highly acidic aqueous media."
"Ovariectomy in rodents is a good model for mimicking human ovarian hormone loss This work Studies the consequences of ovariectomy on the nervous and Immune systems in the context of biological aging Ovariectomy accelerates the process of aging by impairing the sensorimotor abilities (with loss of muscular vigor and impaired equilibrium and traction capacities) and the exploratory capacities (with reduction of vertical exploratory activity). It also leads to a premature immunosenescence with regard to chemotaxis index, lymphoproliferative response and natural killer activity, parameters investigated in the spleen and axillary nodes Therefore, ovariectomy deteriorates homeostasis and may be a model of premature aging.

"Background: Polyubiquitin chains are signaling polypeptides altering the fate of substrates. Results: A Lys-48-ubiquitin chain of a length greater than four, but not its Lys-63 linkage counterparts, slowed the rate of additional ubiquitin conjugation. Conclusion: The ubiquitin chain length and linkage may impact kinetic rates of chain elongation. Significance: Our findings suggest a self-restraining mechanism that limits Lys-48-polyubiquitination. We have explored the mechanisms of polyubiquitin chain assembly with reconstituted ubiquitination of IB and -catenin by the Skp1-cullin 1-TrCP F-box protein (SCFTrCP) E3 ubiquitin (Ub) ligase complex. Competition experiments revealed that SCFTrCP formed a complex with IB and that the Nedd8 modified E3-substrate platform engaged in dynamic interactions with the Cdc34 E2 Ub conjugating enzyme for chain elongation. Using elongation intermediates containing -catenin linked with Ub chains of defined length, it was observed that a Lys-48-Ub chain of a length greater than four, but not its Lys-63 linkage counterparts, slowed the rate of additional Ub conjugation. Thus, the Ub chain length and linkage impact kinetic rates of chain elongation. Given that Lys-48-tetra-Ub is packed into compact conformations due to extensive intrachain interactions between Ub subunits, this topology may limit the accessibility of SCFTrCP/Cdc34 to the distal Ub Lys-48 and result in slowed elongation."
"Arsenic is a cancer chemotherapeutic but hepatotoxicity can be a limiting side effect. O-2-vinyl 1-[2-(carboxylato)pyrrolidin-1-yl]diazen-1-ium-1,2-diolate (V-PROLI/NO) is a nitric oxide (NO) donor prodrug and metabolized by liver cytochromes P450 (CYP450) to release NO. The effects of V-PROLI/NO pretreatment on the toxicity of arsenic (as NaAsO2) were studied in a rat liver cell line (TRL 1215). The cells acted upon the prodrug to release NO, as assessed by nitrite levels, in a time-dependent fashion to maximal levels of 8-fold above basal levels. Pretreatment with V-PROLI/NO markedly reduced arsenic cytolethality which was directly related to the level of NO produced by V-PROLI/NO treatment. Cyp1a1 expression was directly related to the level of NO production and to reduced arsenic cytotoxicity. V-PROLI/NO pretreatment markedly reduced arsenic-induced apoptosis and suppressed phosphorylation of JNK1/2. V-PROLI/NO pretreatment facilitated additional increases in arsenic-induced metallothionein, a metal-binding protein important in arsenic tolerance. Thus, V-PROLI/NO protects against arsenic toxicity in rat liver cells, reducing cytolethality, apoptosis and dysregulation of MAPKs, through generation of NO formed after metabolism by liver cell enzymes, possibly including Cyp1a1. CYP450 required for NO production from V-PROLI/NO treatment in the rat and human appears to differ as we have previously studied the ability of V-PROLI/NO to prevent arsenic toxicity in human liver cells where it reduced toxicity apparently through a CYP2E1-mediated metabolic mechanism. None-the-less, it appears that both rat and human liver cells act upon V-PROLI/NO via a CYP450-related mechanism to produce NO and subsequently reduce arsenic toxicity.

"Comparative effect of meta-topolin and other cytokinins was assessed to develop an efficient and reliable regeneration protocol for Tecoma stans, using mature nodal explants. The morphogenic effect of benzyl adenine (BA), kinetin (Kin), meta- topolin (mT) and 2-iP (2-iso pentenyl adenine) at various concentrations (1.0-10 mu M) was studied individually or in combination with auxins (IAA, IBA or NAA). Superior multiplication rates were achieved on MS medium supplemented with mT and NAA. Of the tested combinations, maximum shoot regeneration (95%), mean shoot number (19.60.60) and length (5.26 +/- 0.73cm) was recorded on MS medium supplemented with 7.5 mu M mT+0.5 mu M NAA after 8weeks of incubation. Among the different auxins employed for in vitro root induction, 92.5% microshoots rooted on MS medium enriched with 1.0 mu M IBA with 10.8 +/- 0.20 mean root number and 5.62 +/- 0.17cm length after 4weeks of incubation. The acclimatized plants grew well in green house with 90% survival rate. The gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis of ethanol leaf extract of in vitro-raised plants yielded a higher number of compounds than control plant. The assessment of genetic fidelity among regenerants, using ISSR markers did not reveal any somaclonal variation. Therefore, the protocol developed appears to be simple and reliable for mass production of clones with higher diversity of secondary metabolites. Key message Our studies based on interaction of mT with auxins for better shoot proliferation will undoubtedly be helpful in understanding many developmental processes in plant tissue culture. The regenerated plantlets survived well under field conditions and no somaclonal variation was detected. This study proved that in vitro raised plants are superior for the production of higher diversity of secondary metabolites than in vivo plant. Thus, our findings are helpful in generating an efficient micropropagation system for mass scale production of plants with higher diversity of bio-active molecules without losing their genetic stability."
"The effects of confinement of multilayer graphene platelets in hydrophobic microporous polymeric membranes are here examined. Intermolecular interactions between water vapour molecules and nanocomposite membranes are envisaged to originate assisted transport of water vapour in membrane distillation processes when a suitable filler-polymer ratio is reached. Mass transport coefficients are estimated under different working conditions, suggesting a strong dependence of the transport on molecular interactions. Remarkably, no thermal polarization is observed, although the filler exhibits ultrahigh thermal conductivity. In contrast, enhanced resistance to wetting as well as outstanding mechanical and chemical stability meets the basic requirements of water purification via membrane distillation. As a result, a significant improvement of the productivity-efficiency trade-off is achieved with respect to the pristine polymeric membrane when low amounts of platelets are confined in spherulitic-like PVDF networks."
"We demonstrate a freeform lens to enhance the angular color uniformity (ACU) of white light-emitting diodes (LEDs) whose phosphor layers were coated by freely dispersed coating processes. Monte Carlo ray tracing simulation results indicated that the ACU of the modified LED integrated with the freeform lens significantly increased from 0.334 to 0.957, compared with the traditional LED. Enhancement of ACU reached as high as 186.5%. Moreover, the ACU of the modified LED was not only at a high level, but also stable when the shape of the phosphor layer changed. The freeform lens provided an effective way to achieve white LEDs with high ACU at low cost. (C) 2010 Optical Society of America"
"PurposeWith the increased availability of colonoscopy to average risk persons due to insurance coverage benefit changes, we sought to identify changes in the colonoscopy workforce. We used outpatient discharge records from South Carolina between 2001 and 2010 to examine shifts over time and in urban versus rural areas in the types of medical providers who perform colonoscopy, and the practice settings in which they occur, and to explore variation in colonoscopy volume across facility and provider types. MethodsUsing an all-payer outpatient discharge records database from South Carolina, we conducted a retrospective analysis of all colonoscopy procedures performed between 2001 and 2010. FindingsWe identified a major shift in the type of facilities performing colonoscopy in South Carolina since 2001, with substantial gains in ambulatory surgery settings (2001: 15, 2010: 34, +127%) versus hospitals (2001: 58, 2010: 59, +2%), particularly in urban areas (2001: 12, 2010: 27, +125%). The number of internists (2001: 46, 2010: 76) and family physicians (2001: 34, 2010: 106) performing colonoscopies also increased (+65% and +212%, respectively), while their annual procedures volumes stayed fairly constant. Significant variation in annual colonoscopy volume was observed across medical specialties (P < .001), with nongastroenterologists having lower volumes versus gastroenterologists and colon and rectal surgeons. ConclusionsThere have been substantial changes over time in the number of facilities and physicians performing colonoscopy in South Carolina since 2001, particularly in urban counties. Findings suggest nongastroenterologists are meeting a need for colonoscopies in rural areas."
"Mesoporous silica nanoparticles (MSNs) are delivery vehicles that can carry cargo molecules and release them on command. The particles used in the applications reported in this Account are around 100 nm in diameter (about the size of a virus) and contain 2.5 nm tubular pores with a total volume of about 1 cm(3)/g. For the biomedical applications discussed here, the cargo is trapped in the pores until the particles are stimulated to release it. The challenges are to get the particles to the site of a disease and then to deliver the cargo on command. We describe methods to do both, and we illustrate the applicability of the particles to cure cancer and intracellular infectious disease. Our first steps were to design multifunctional nanoparticles with properties that allow them to carry and deliver hydrophobic drugs. Many important pharmaceuticals are hydrophobic and cannot reach the diseased sites by themselves. We describe how we modified MSNs to make them dispersible, imagable, and targetable and discuss in vitro studies. We then present examples of surface modifications that allow them to deliver large molecules such as siRNA. In vivo studies of siRNA delivery to treat triple negative breast and ovarian cancers are presented. The next steps are to attach nanomachines and other types of caps that trap drug molecules but release them when stimulated. We describe nanomachines that respond autonomously (without human intervention) to stimuli specific to disease sites. A versatile type of machine is a nanovalve that is closed at neutral (blood) pH but opens upon acidification that occurs in endolysosomes of cancer cells. Another type of machine, a snap-top cap, is stimulated by reducing agents such as glutathione in the cytosol of cells. Both of these platforms were studied in vitro to deliver antibiotics to infected macrophages and in vivo to cure and kill the intracellular bacteria M. tuberculosis and F. tularensis. The latter is a tier 1 select agent of bioterrorism. Finally, we describe nanomachines for drug delivery that are controlled by externally administered light and magnetic fields. A futuristic dream for nanotherapy is the ability to control a nano-object everywhere in the body. Magnetic fields penetrate completely and have spatial selectivity governed by the size of the field-producing coil. We describe how to control nanovalves with alternating magnetic fields (AMFs) and superparamagnetic cores inside the MSNs. The AMF heats the cores, and temperature-sensitive caps release the cargo. In vitro studies demonstrate dose control of the therapeutic to cause apoptosis without overheating the cells. Nanocarriers have great promise for therapeutic applications, and MSNs that can carry drugs to the site of a disease to produce a high local concentration without premature release and off-target damage may have the capability of realizing this goal."

"This paper investigates the generalization of Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to Riemannian manifolds. We first propose a new and general type of family of subspaces in manifolds that we call barycentric subspaces. They are implicitly defined as the locus of points which are weighted means of k+1 reference points. As this definition relies on points and not on tangent vectors, it can also be extended to geodesic spaces which are not Riemannian. For instance, in stratified spaces, it naturally allows principal subspaces that span several strata, which is impossible in previous generalizations of PCA. We show that barycentric subspaces locally define a submanifold of dimension k which generalizes geodesic subspaces. Second, we rephrase PCA in Euclidean spaces as an optimization on flags of linear subspaces (a hierarchy of properly embedded linear subspaces of increasing dimension). We show that the Euclidean PCA minimizes the Accumulated Unexplained Variances by all the subspaces of the flag (AUV). Barycentric subspaces are naturally nested, allowing the construction of hierarchically nested subspaces. Optimizing the AUV criterion to optimally approximate data points with flags of affine spans in Riemannian manifolds lead to a particularly appealing generalization of PCA on manifolds called Barycentric Subspace Analysis (BSA)."
"There is ongoing policy debate about the potential for malpractice liability reform to reduce the use of defensive medicine and slow the growth of health care spending. The effectiveness of such policy levers hinges on the degree to which physicians respond to liability pressures by prescribing medically unnecessary care. Many estimates of this relationship are based on physician reports. We present new survey evidence on physician assessment of their own use of medically unnecessary care in response to medical liability and other pressures, including a randomized evaluation of the sensitivity of those responses to survey framing. We find that while use of such care is potentially quite prevalent, responses vary substantially based on survey framing, with the way the question is phrased driving differences in responses that are often as great as those driven by physician specialty or whether the physician has personally been named in a lawsuit. These results suggest that self-reported use of medically unnecessary care ought to be used with caution in the formulation of malpractice liability system reform."
"BACKGROUND & AIMS: Hepatitis delta virus (HDV) infection causes fulminant hepatitis and increases the severity of chronic hepatitis B virus infection, leading to cirrhosis, liver failure, or hepatocellular carcinoma. There are 8 HDV genotypes (genotypes 1-8). We previously developed a TaqMan real-time reverse transcriptase (RT)-PCR method that is able to quantify viral load of all HDV genotypes (linear from 2 to 8 log(10) copies/mL). We compared its results with those from 3 commercial real-time RT-PCR assays: the Lightmix HDV kit (designed to quantify HDV genotype 1 [HDV-1]), and the RoboGene and the DiaPro HDV RNA quantification kits (designed to quantify all genotypes). METHODS: We selected RNA from 128 clinical samples of all HDV genotypes except HDV-4, with various HDV viral load values. We also analyzed 5 samples, collected over time, from each of 6 patients infected with strains of different genotypes. RESULTS: Quantification results from the commercial kits for HDV-1 from European or Asian samples were consistent with those from our method, however, they underestimated (0.5-1 log(10) with Lightmix and DiaPro) and did not detect (1 and 4 samples with Lightmix and DiaPro, respectively) HDV-1 African samples. Moreover, the commercial kits greatly underestimated HDV viral load of almost all non-genotype-1 strains (about 2-3 log(10)), and even did not detect HDV-7 or HDV-8 RNA in several samples with high concentrations of virus. CONCLUSIONS: Commercial kits accurately quantify HDV-1 in samples from European and Asian patients. However, they can dramatically underestimate or fail to quantify HDV viral load from samples from African patients infected with strains of genotypes 1 and 5 to 8."
"The electrochemical dechlorination of para-chloronitrobenzene (p-CNB) was investigated in order to reduce the impact on environment. Based on the sponge-like structure of Ni foam and the catalytic activity of Pd, the Ni/Pd foam electrode exhibited excellent catalytic properties for dechlorination of p-CNB. Electrocatalytic dechlorination performance of Ni/Pd foam electrode for p-CNB was superior to that of other cathodes, such as Ni foam, Ti plates, graphite, and Ti/Pd cathodes. The degradation rate of p-CNB on the Ni/Pd foam electrode is highest among them, and a desirable dechlorination effect can also be obtained. Under optimized conditions of 10 mA cm(-2) current density, pH of 7 and Na2SO4 of 50 mM as electrolyte, the removal efficiency of p-CNB (25 mg L-1) is more than 99% within 30 min. The process can be described by pseudo-first-order kinetics with the rate constant of 0.147 min(-1), and the AN (aniline) formation efficiency reaches 88.2% within 30 min. In acidic condition, the AN formation efficiency increases to 98.4% within 30 min. The synergistic combination of the current density, acidic condition and lower electrolyte concentration plays an important role in tuning the favor degradation and dechlorination of p-CNB. In addition, among three possible pathways of p-CNB dechlorination proposed, the route from ammoniation to para-chloroaniline (p-CAN) by dechlorination is regarded as the main pathway.(C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

The exact explicit traveling solutions to the two completely integrable sixth-order nonlinear equations KdV6 are given by using the method of dynamical systems and Cosgrove's work. It is proved that these traveling wave solutions correspond to some orbits in the 4-dimensional phase space of two 4-dimensional dynamical systems. These orbits lie in the intersection of two level sets defined by two first integrals.
"Background: Genetic polymorphisms of human cytochrome P450 2A6 (CYP2A6) are one of the determinants of smoking behavior and/or tobacco-related lung cancer risk in male Japanese smokers. To help identify those at high risk, we developed a multiplex real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based genotyping method with dual-labeled probes to detect wild-type and whole-gene deletion of CYP2A6 directly from blood samples without DNA isolation. Methods: We validated the new real-time PCR method that uses dual-labeled probes by utilizing 116 genomic DNA samples that had been genotyped previously and 33 blood samples. Results: The new method could discriminate CYP2A6 from highly homologous CYP2A7 and CYP2A13 genes and could also determine CYP2A6*1 (wild type) and CYP2A6*4 (whole-gene deletion) alleles in perfect accordance with previous analysis data. Amplification curve profiles were obtained by multiplex real-time PCR assay with CYP2A6*1 and CYP2A6*4 primer sets and dual-labeled probes using one-drop blood samples previously genotyped for CYP2A6*1/*1, CYP2A6*1/*4, and CYP2A6*4/*4. Conclusions: A real-time multiplex PCR assay for genotyping wild-type CYP2A6 and whole-gene deletion was developed with dual-labeled probes. The new method achieved 100% agreement with data from the conventional PCR method for 116 genomic DNA samples and samples from 33 volunteers, thereby establishing its validity. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

"The record of fossil charophytes from Sweden was previously restricted to the Ladinian-earliest Carnian Falsterbo Formation. Here, we present a charophyte assemblage from the Upper Triassic KAgerod Formation exposed at the Balteberga Gorge (Sickle, southern Sweden) from the perspectives of taxonomy, taphonomy, palaeoecology and biostratigraphy. The microfossils originate from an interval of reddish sandy mudstone and are represented by rare fossil thalli, calcium carbonate encrustations of thalli and numerous calcified fructifications, called gyrogonites. The assemblage is relatively diverse, comprising six species belonging to four genera of the family Porocharaceae (Auerbachichara cf. rhaetica, Porochara sp., Stellatochara germanica, Stellatochara aff. subsphaerica, Stenochara aff. donetziana, Stenochara aff. kisielevskyi). Both the sedimentological context and the preservation of the charophyte remains point to an autochthonous origin for the charophyte-bearing strata. An autochthonous origin together with the habitat of modern charophytes, infer that the charophyte interval was deposited in shallow ephemeral pond or lake in a terrestrial setting. Their occurrence is also indicative of low amount of nutrients and the numerous thalli encrustations suggest a rather alkaline water composition. Some of the described species (Auerbachichara cf. rhaetica and Stellatochara aff. subsphaerica) are useful for biostratigraphical correlations which attributes the assemblage to the Auerbachichara rhaetica Range zone (sensu Bilan, 1991) in the proposed Germanic Triassic charophyte zonation. This range zone is assigned to a latest Carnian to late Norian age, strengthened by an interlayering with rocks containing a characteristic assemblage of palynomorphs (Corollina meyeriana subzone a and b) in the Upper Triassic of the Polish part of the Germanic Basin. The findings of the first Triassic thalli further strengthen the suggestion that the early Mesozoic fossil record of charophytes is not solely composed of oospores and gyrogonites. A better understanding of vegetative fossil remains (silicified thalli and encrustations) of charophytes may provide important future palaeoecological implications and links between recent and extinct forms. Our findings also provide evidence that charophyte occurrences in the ICagerod Formation are strictly controlled by palaeoenvironmental factors. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."
"Introduction: Glenohumeral arthrodesis is a rare salvage procedure for selected patients with different shoulder pathologies. Among a variety of surgical techniques, compression screws or plate fixation are most widely used. Minimally invasive screw fixation has become more popular, although it has been shown to be biomechanically inferior to plate arthrodesis. Hypothesis: Screw arthrodesis would lead to a higher revision rate than plate arthrodesis. Material and methods: Twenty-seven plate and 7 screw arthrodesis of the glenohumeral joint in 19 male and 15 female patients of a mean age of 50 years (range, 16-85 years) were reviewed in a retrospective multicenter study with at a follow-up of 43 months (range, 11-152 months) to compare their clinical and radiographic outcome with special focus on revision rate. Results: Constant score did not change, but its subscore for pain significantly improved from 4.5 points (range, 0-15 points) to 11 points (range, 6-15 points). The subjective shoulder value increased significantly from 19% (range, 0-70%) to 41% (range, 10-80%) and 81% of the patients were satisfied. In 14 patients (41%), the arthrodesis had to be revised either for non-union (11) or malunion (3) at a mean of 12 months (range, 0-47 months). The 2 groups did not differ in terms of demographic data, nor of preoperative and postoperative clinical data. There were more revisions after screw than plate fixation. If revision was performed for non-union, this difference was significant. Discussion/conclusion: In selected patients, glenohumeral arthrodesis can significantly reduce pain and achieve at best a reasonable function and subjective satisfaction rate. Revision rates favor plate over isolated screw fixation. (C) 2017 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved."
"Objective: In 2013 a novel commercial test was launched (Anser(1) ADA test) for the assay of serum adalimumab (ADL) and antibodies to adalimumab (ATA). This study aims to understand clinical practice patterns used with ADL in a real-world cross-sectional population.Methods: Wilcoxon rank sum test, and linear and logistic regression methods were applied in the statistical analysis to test hypotheses. The study design was observational and uncontrolled.Results: Of a total of 14,239 tests conducted, 5509 had information available that pertained to reasons for ordering, of which disease monitoring (46.9%) was the most common. Median serum ADL level with standard maintenance dosing (40mg, biweekly) was 8.8g/mL (n=2901). A five-fold decrease in median serum ADL levels occurred with very low ATA titers (1.7-3U/mL, p<.0001). Serum ADL levels decreased further with ATA >7U/mL (p<.0001). A total of 16.5% of patients were ATA positive, of whom 61.9% had low ATA (1.7-7U/mL); 87.9% of ATA-positive patients had serum ADL levels 4.4g/mL. Expression of inflammatory markers significantly increased with high ATA (>7U/mL). An inverse relationship between ADL and ATA was observed (R-2: 0.49), and 4.1g/mL was identified as a cut-off that may segregate ATA-positive patients.Conclusion: In this real-world cross-sectional population, serum ADL levels decreased with increasing ATA titers, with low ATA titers (7U/mL) significantly reducing serum ADL compared to ATA-negative samples. Expression of inflammatory markers significantly increased at higher ATA titers (>7U/mL). These findings highlight the clinical importance of monitoring patients for drug levels and anti-drug antibody titers."
"We consider a time semi-discretization of the Caginalp phase-field model based on an operator splitting method. For every time-step parameter tau, we build an exponential attractor M-tau of the discrete-in-time dynamical system. We prove that M-tau converges to an exponential attractor M-0 of the continuous-in-time dynamical system for the symmetric Hausdorff distance as tau tends to 0. We also provide an explicit estimate of this distance and we prove that the fractal dimension of M-tau is bounded by a constant independent of tau."
"We aimed to investigate the influence of media portrayals of suicide on adolescents' mood, focusing on the case of 13 Reasons Why, a webseries that raised concerns for approaching suicide explicitly for an audience mostly composed of adolescents. There is already evidence of an increase in suicide-related Internet searches shortly following its release. Our study included 7004 individuals aged 12-18 years. Participants were recruited through posts on 13 Reasons Why-themed social media groups. Volunteers filled an online questionnaire made available throughout May 2017 (54-71 days after the show was released). The questionnaire collected data on socio-demographic characteristics, mood (sadness and lack of motivation) in the month previous to watching the series, and prevalence of self-harm, suicidal ideation, or suicide attempts. Changes in mood were considered the main outcome; the variable was derived from a question asking about feelings of sadness and lack of motivation after watching the show. Overall, 23.7% reported worsening in mood after watching 13 Reasons Why. This rate was higher among individuals who, before watching the series, experienced more frequent and intense feelings of sadness and lack of motivation (OR 2.73 for frequent or daily feelings; OR 3.61 for intense feelings) or reported suicidal ideation/self-harm/suicide attempt (OR 1.38), even after controlling for sex and age. In times of easy access to digital content and binge-watching, the way mental health issues are portrayed in fiction needs to be carefully debated and thought out."
"Background: Several environmental and lifestyle factors have a significant role in the incidence of various types of cancer. Lifestyle factors are important elements in the development of cancer, and correction of them can lead to prevention. Given that the underlying cause of cancer is unclear, comparing the lifestyle of two groups of women can explain some of the breast cancer risk factors. Objective: The present study was conducted to compare the lifestyle dimensions in women with and without breast cancer. Methods: This cross-sectional study was carried out to compare two groups of 546 women (273 healthy individuals and 273 cancer patients). The lifestyle sub-scales were collected using a lifestyle questionnaire (LSQ). The differences between the scores of the eight sub-scales in the two groups were analyzed using independent t-test and Mann-Whitney test. Results: The mean age of the participants in both groups of this study was 44.51 +/- 11.28. Although the lifestyle scores of the healthy individuals were higher than the patient group, in terms of all eight dimensions of lifestyle, a significant difference was found between the two groups in terms of four dimensions (P<0.05). Also, there was a positive and significant correlation between the socioeconomic status and the lifestyle of women with breast cancer (P=0.49). Conclusions: Regarding the difference between the lifestyle score of the two groups, it seems to be necessary for authorities and healthcare providers to plan for educational programs of lifestyle practices, and healthy behaviors. Besides, conducting longitudinal studies are recommended to find the causal relationship between the two variables."
"Quantitative structure-property relationships (QSPRs), based only on a single-parameter, are proposed for the prediction of physico-chemical properties, namely, aqueous solubility (log S-W), octanol-water partition coefficient (log K-OW) and octanol-air partition coefficient (log K-OA) of polychloronaphthalenes (PCNs) including all the 75 chloronaphthalene congeners. The QSPR models are developed using molecular descriptors computed through quantum mechanical methods including ab-initio as well as advanced semi-empirical methods. The predictivity of the developed models is tested through state-of-the-art external validation procedures employing an external prediction set of compounds. To analyse the role of instantaneous interactions between electrons (the electron-correlation), the models are also compared with those developed using only the electron-correlation contribution of the quantum chemical descriptor. The electron-correlation contribution towards the chemical hardness and the LUMO energy are observed to be the best predictors for octanol-water partition coefficient, whereas for the octanol-air partition coefficient, the total electronic energy and electron-correlation energy are found to be reliable descriptors, in fact, even better than the polarisability. For aqueous solubility of PCNs, the absolute electronegativity is observed to be the best predictor. This work suggests that the electron-correlation contribution of a quantum-chemical descriptor can be used as a reliable indicator for physico-chemical properties, particularly the partition coefficients.

"The term 'stylised facts' has been extensively researched through the analysis of many different financial datasets. More recently, cryptocurrencies have been investigated as a new type of financial asset, and provide an interesting example, with a current market value of over $500 billion. Here, we analyse the stylised facts in terms of the Hurst exponent, using both the DFA and RCS methods, of the four most popular cryptocurrencies ranked according to their market capitalisation. The analysis is conducted on high frequency returns data with varying lags. In addition to using the Hurst exponent, our analysis also considers features of dependence between the different cryptocurrencies. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."
"Macromonomer initiators behave as macro cross-linkers, macro initiators, and macromonomers to obtain branched and cross-linked block/graft copolymers. A series of new macromonomer initiators for atom transfer radical polymerization (MIM-ATRP) based on polyethylene glycol (M-n = 495D, 2203D, and 4203D) (PEG) were synthesized by the reaction of the hydroxyl end of mono-methacryloyl polyethylene glycol with 2-bromo propanoyl chloride, leading to methacryloyl polyethylene glycol 2-bromo propanoyl ester. Poly (ethylene glycol) functionalized with methacrylate at one end was reacted with 2-bromopropionyl chloride to form a macromonomeric initiator for ATRP. ATRP was found to be a more controllable polymerization method than conventional free radical polymerization in view of fewer cross-linked polymers and highly branched polymers produced from macromonomer initiators as well. In another scenario, ATRP of N-isopropylacrylamide (NIPAM) was initiated by MIM-ATRP to obtain PEG-b-PNIPAM branched block/graft copolymers. Thermal analysis, FTIR, H-1 NMR, TEM, and SEM techniques were used in the characterization of the products. They had a thermo-responsive character and exhibited volume phase transition at similar to 36 degrees C. A plasticizer effect of PEG in graft copolymers was also observed, indicating a lower glass transition temperature than that of pure PNIPAM. Homo and copolymerization kinetics were also evaluated.

"The gammarid amphipod Dikerogammarus villosus is a relatively recent arrival in Europe, and has become well established in Lake Constance, one of the largest oligotrophic lakes in Europe. Lake Constance has previously been colonized by the notoriously invasive zebra mussel Dreissena polymorpha. Here, using field observations, we report an unusual form of active physical attachment of the invasive zebra mussel D. polymorpha to the invasive gammarid D. villosus in Lake Constance, Germany. Infested D. villosus were collected in January, February and March 2017, where they had naturally colonized the support legs of two instruments, installed in November 2016 for routine monitoring of internal wave velocity. A total of 331 D. villosus were collected among which 11.78 % were ""infested"" with D. polymorpha. About 66 % of D. villosus ""infested"" with D. polymorpha were male and 28.5 % of D. villosus were attached to more than one (maximum of three) D. polymorpha. To evaluate the significance of this phenomenon, in February, we counted all D. polymorpha and D. villosus attached to the two devices. We found, at one instrument alone, ca. 3 % of D. villosus were ""infested"" with D. polymorpha. These results are startling, given that the phenomenon is otherwise almost completely unrecorded. We discuss whether this unusual and dynamic physical attachment might serve as a supplementary path for further invasion and expansion by D. polymorpha, both within and between water bodies. We also describe the potential effects of the phenomenon on D. villosus, in particular the implications for essential activities such as feeding, movement and moulting."
"Complementary and alternative medications (CAM) with known or suspected pharmacologic activity in the central nervous system (CNS) are common. These herbal preparations may cause clinically significant drug-drug interactions (DDIs) when coadministered with medications that act in the CNS. This can result in negative outcomes such as toxicity or loss of efficacy. Most drug interaction reports with CAM focus on cytochrome P450 (CYP) modulation. However, drug interactions between CAM and conventional medications may occur via mechanisms other than CYP inhibition or induction; in particular, modulation of drug transport proteins represents an important mechanism by which such interactions may occur. This article provides an updated review of transporter-mediated mechanisms by which herbal products may theoretically interact with centrally acting medications at the blood-brain barrier and blood-cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) barrier. Further research is required before the true clinical impact of interactions involving modulation of centrally located membrane transporters can be fully understood."
"Paid search has become the mainstream platform for online advertising, further intensifying competition between advertisers. The main objective of this research is twofold. On the one hand, we want to understand, in the context of paid-search advertising, the effects of competition (measured by the number of ads on the paid-search listings) on click volume and the cost per click (CPC) of paid-search ads. On the other hand, we are interested in understanding the determinants of competition, that is, how various demand and supply factors affect the entry probability of firms and, consequently, the total number of entrants for a keyword. We regard each keyword as a market and build an integrative model consisting of three key components: (i) the realized click volume of each entrant as a function of the baseline click volume and the decay factor; (ii) the vector of realized CPCs of those entrants as a function of the decay factor and the order statistics of the value per click at an equilibrium condition; and (iii) the number of entrants, the product of the number of potential entrants multiplied by the entry probability; the entry probability is determined by the expected revenue (a function of expected click volume, CPC, and value per click) and the entry cost at the equilibrium condition of an incomplete information game. The proposed modeling framework entails several econometric challenges. To cope with these challenges, we develop a Bayesian estimation approach to make model inferences. Our proposed model is applied to a data set of 1,597 keywords associated with digital camera/ video and their accessories with full information on competition. Our empirical analysis indicates that the number of competing ads has a significant impact on the baseline click volume, decay factor, and value per click. These findings help paid-search advertisers assess the impact of competition on their entry decisions and advertising profitability. In the counterfactual analysis, we investigate the profit implication of two polices for the paid-search host: raising the decay factor by encouraging consumers to engage in more in-depth search/click-through and providing coupons to advertisers."
"State-to-state reaction probabilities for the H + CH4 -> H-2 + CH3 reaction are calculated by accurate full-dimensional quantum dynamics calculations employing the multilayer multiconfigurational time-dependent Hartree approach and the quantum transition-state concept. Reactions starting from different vibrational and rotational states of the methane reactant are investigated for vanishing total angular momentum. The vibrational state distributions of the products are found to be essentially independent of the initial rovibrational state of the reactants. The reaction products only show vibrational excitation in the methyl umbrella mode. No excitation in H-2 vibration or another CH3 vibration is observed. Analyzing the results, the observed loss of vibrational memory can be explained by a transition-state-based view of the reaction process."
"Rad54 is an important factor in the homologous recombination pathway of DNA double-strand break repair. However, Rad54 knockout (KO) mice do not exhibit overt phenotypes at adulthood, even when exposed to radiation. In this study, we show that in Rad54 KO mouse the germline is actually altered. Compared with the wild-type (WT) animals, these mice have less premeiotic germ cells. This germ cell loss is found as early as in E11.5 embryos, suggesting an early failure during mutant primordial germ cells development. Both testicular and ovarian KO germ cells exhibited high radiation sensitivity leading to a long-term gametogenesis defect at adulthood. The KO female germline was particularly affected displaying decreased litter size or sterility. Spermatogenesis recovery after irradiation was slower and incomplete in Rad54 KO mice compared with that of WT mice, suggesting that loss of germ stem cell precursors is not fully compensated along the successive rounds of spermatogenesis. Finally, spermatogenesis recovery after postnatal irradiation is in part regulated by glial-cell-line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) in KO but not in irradiated WT mice, suggesting that Sertoli cell GDNF production is stimulated upon substantial germ cell loss only. Our findings suggest that Rad54 has a key function in maintaining genomic integrity of the developing germ cells."

"Objective: To describe the pulmonary function in children and adolescents with postinfectious bronchiolitis obliterans (PIBO), as well as to evaluate potential risk factors for severe impairment of pulmonary function. Methods: The pulmonary function of 77 participants, aged 8-18 years, was assessed by spirometry and plethysmography. The following parameters were analyzed: FVC; FEV1; FEF25-75%; FEV1/FVC; RV; TLC; RV/TLC; intrathoracic gas volume; and specific airway resistance (sRaw). We used Poisson regression to investigate the following potential risk factors for severe impairment of pulmonary function: gender; age at first wheeze; age at diagnosis; family history of asthma; tobacco smoke exposure; length of hospital stay; and duration of mechanical ventilation. Results: The mean age was 13.5 years. There were pronounced decreases in FEV1 and FEF25-75%, as well as increases in RV and sRaw. These alterations are characteristic of obstructive airway disease. For the parameters that were the most affected, the mean values (percentage of predicted) were as follows: FEV1 = 45.9%; FEF25-75% = 21.5%; RV = 281.1%; RV/TLC = 236.2%; and sRaw = 665.3%. None of the potential risk factors studied showed a significant association with severely impaired pulmonary function. Conclusions: The patients with PIBO had a common pattern of severe pulmonary function impairment, characterized by marked airway obstruction and pronounced increases in RV and sRaw. The combination of spirometric and plethysmographic measurements can be more useful for assessing functional damage, as well as in the follow-up of these patients, than are either of these techniques used in isolation. Known risk factors for respiratory diseases do not seem to be associated with severely impaired pulmonary function in PIBO."
"Chronic inflammation associated with obesity is now recognized to be an important condition in promoting carcinogenesis and progression in breast cancer patients, mostly in postmenopausal women with tumors expressing estrogen and progesterone receptors. In obese patients, altered levels of several inflammatory mediators regulating aromatase and estrogen expression are one of the mechanisms responsible of increase breast cancer risk. Growing attention has also been paid to the local adipose inflammation and the role played by macrophages as determinants of breast cancer risk recurrence and prognosis. The inflammation-obesity axis offers different molecular signaling pathways for therapeutic interventions and potential pharmacological targets. The increasing rate of obesity worldwide associated with the recent findings linking inflammation and breast cancer urge further investigation."
"Inferences that result from exhaustification of a sentence S depend on the set of alternatives to S. In this paper, we present some inference patterns that are problematic for previous theories of alternatives and propose some structural constraints on the derivation of formal alternatives which derive the observations."
"The paper examines the challenges faced by senior Biology students in reading 'nominalizations' in textbook materials and illustrates how the challenges can be addressed through pedagogical activities. The study draws on emerging descriptions of field and discourse semantics in Systemic Functional Linguistics that are inspired by Halliday's distinction between 'live' and 'dead' grammatical metaphors. It first presents a metalanguage to discriminate functions of nominalization. Two different kinds of 'mismatches' of meaning are discussed, including how field activities are reconstrued through discourse semantic resources, and how discourse semantic resources are remapped as lexicogrammatical resources. The paper attends to nominalization from the perspective of the knowledge that is at stake in its use. In addition to providing linguistic metalanguage, the paper demonstrates pedagogic practices designed to support teachers to make this knowledge visible. These pedagogic practices include cross-mode redescription and Detailed Reading from SFL-informed Reading to Learn pedagogy. (c) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."
"We evaluate the cost-effectiveness of two early childhood interventions that use instructional coaching and parent coaching as levers for improvement. The study design allows us to compare the individual effects of each intervention as well as their combined effect on student outcomes. We find that teachers receiving instructional coaching improve their use of evidence-based instructional practices, while families receiving parent coaching show increases in numerous responsive parenting behaviors associated with positive child outcomes. Both interventions demonstrate positive impacts on students, but only parent coaching shows statistically significant effects across a range of student outcomes. Instructional coaching alone is substantially less costly and may therefore be the most cost-effective of the three treatment conditions; however, small sample sizes limit our ability to reach definitive conclusions. Policy simulations suggest that implementing these interventions could raise the overall cost-effectiveness of Head Start by at least 16 percent."
"It is difficult that all the boundaries of chaotic system were estimated precisely; this is why the coupling coefficient cannot be determined beforehand in the problem of synchronization of complex networks. Thus, an estimation of coupling coefficient should be given before designing some controllers. In addition, to realize the synchronization, the estimated coupling coefficient has to be large enough. However, it is not true that the larger the coupling coefficient the better the synchronization is. In fact, a coupling coefficient which is larger than what it needs to be means the energy waste. To overcome this difficulty, in this paper we propose an adaptive coupling method. And a new concept about asymptotic stability is presented. Numerical simulations are implemented on different complex networks. The results indicate that the synchronization can be achieved without a large estimated coefficient."
"In this work we have developed an in silico model to predict the inhibition of beta-amyloid aggregation by small organic molecules. In particular we have explored the inhibitory activity of a series of 62 N-phenylanthranilic acids using Kohonen maps and Counterpropagation Artificial Neural Networks. The effects of various structural modifications on biological activity are investigated and novel structures are designed using the developed in silico model. More specifically a search for optimized pharmacophore patterns by insertions, substitutions, and ring fusions of pharmacophoric substituents of the main building block scaffolds is described. The detection of the domain of applicability defines compounds whose estimations can be accepted with confidence. (C) 2010 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved."
"Optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) dating of dune deposits has increasingly been used as a tool to investigate the response of aeolian systems to environmental change. Amalgamation of individual dune accumulation chronologies has been employed in order to distinguish regional from local geomorphic responses to change. However, advances in dating have produced chronologies of increasing complexity. In particular, questions regarding the interpretation of dune ages have been raised, including over the most appropriate method to evaluate the significance of suites of OSL ages when local 'noisy' and discontinuous records are combined. In this paper, these issues are reviewed and the reproducibility of dune chronologies is assessed. OSL ages from two cores sampled from the same dune in the northeast Rub' al Khali, United Arab Emirates, are presented and compared, alongside an analysis of previously published dune ages dated to within the last 30 ka. Distinct periods of aeolian activity and preservation are identified, which can be tied to regional climatic and environmental changes. This case study is used to address fundamental questions that are persistently asked of dune dating studies, including the appropriate spatial scale over which to infer environmental and climatic change based on dune chronologies, whether chronological hiatuses can be interpreted, how to most appropriately combine and display datasets, and the relationship between geomorphic and palaeoclimatic signals. Chronological profiles reflect localised responses to environmental variability and climatic forcing, and amalgamation of datasets, with consideration of sampling resolution, is required; otherwise local factors are always likely to dominate. Using net accumulation rates to display ages may provide an informative approach of analysing and presenting dune OSL chronologies less susceptible to biases resulting from insufficient sampling resolution.

"The use of binary blends of hydrogenated and fluorinated alkanethiolates represents an interesting approach to the construction of anisotropic hybrid organic-inorganic nanoparticles since the fluorinated and hydrogenated components are expected to self-sort on the nanoparticle surface because of their reciprocal phobicity. These mixed monolayers are therefore strongly non-ideal binary systems. The synthetic routes we explored to achieve mixed monolayer gold nanoparticles displaying hydrogenated and fluorinated ligands clearly show that the final monolayer composition is a non-linear function of the initial reaction mixture. Our data suggest that, under certain geometrical constraints, nucleation and growth of fluorinated domains could be the initial event in the formation of these mixed monolayers. The onset of domain formation depends on the structure of the fluorinated and hydrogenated species. The solubility of the mixed monolayer nanoparticles displayed a marked discontinuity as a function of the monolayer composition. When the fluorinated component content is small, the nanoparticle systems are fully soluble in chloroform, at intermediate content the nanoparticles become soluble in hexane and eventually they become soluble in fluorinated solvents only. The ranges of monolayer compositions in which the solubility transitions are observed depend on the nature of the thiols composing the monolayer."
"Red blood cell transfusion (RBCT) threshold in patients with sepsis remains a matter of controversy. A threshold of 7 g/dL for stabilized patients with sepsis is commonly proposed, although debated. The aim of the study was to compare the benefit and harm of restrictive versus liberal RBCT strategies in order to guide physicians on RBCT strategies in patients with severe sepsis or septic shock. Four outcomes were assessed: death, nosocomial infection (NI), acute lung injury (ALI) and acute kidney injury (AKI). Studies assessing RBCT strategies or RBCT impact on outcome and including intensive care unit (ICU) patients with sepsis were assessed. Two systematic reviews were achieved: first for the randomized controlled studies (RCTs) and second for the observational studies. MEDLINE, EMBASE, Web of Science Core Collection, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews and Clinical Trials. gov were analyzed up to March 01, 2015. Der Simonian and Laird random-effects models were used to report pooled odds ratios (ORs). Subgroup analyses and meta-regressions were performed to explore studies heterogeneity. One RCT was finally included. The restrictive RBCT strategy was not associated with harm or benefit compared to liberal strategy. Twelve cohort studies were included, of which nine focused on mortality rate. RBCT was not associated with increased mortality rate (overall pooled OR was 1.10 [0.75, 1.60]; I-2 = 57%, p = 0.03), but was associated with the occurrence of NI (2 studies: pooled OR 1.25 [1.04-1.50]; I-2 = 0%, p = 0.97), the occurrence of ALI (1 study: OR 2.75 [1.22-6.37]; p = 0.016) and the occurrence of AKI (1 study: OR 5.22 [2.1-15.8]; p = 0.001). Because there was only one RCT, the final meta-analyses were only based on the cohort studies. As a result, the safety of a RBCT restrictive strategy was confirmed, although only one study specifically focused on ICU patients with sepsis. Then, RBCT was not associated with increased mortality rate, but was associated with increased in occurrence of NI, ALI and AKI. Nevertheless, the data on RBCT in patients with sepsis are sparse and the high heterogeneity between studies prevents from drawing any definitive conclusions."
"The human brain can be described as a network of specialized and spatially distributed regions. The activity of individual regions can be estimated using electroencephalography and the structure of the network can be measured using diffusion magnetic resonance imaging. However, the communication between the different cortical regions occurring through the white matter, coined information flow, cannot be observed by either modalities independently. Here, we present a new method to infer information flow in the white matter of the brain from joint diffusion MRI and EEG measurements. This is made possible by the millisecond resolution of EEG which makes the transfer of information from one region to another observable. A subject specific Bayesian network is built which captures the possible interactions between brain regions at different times. This network encodes the connections between brain regions detected using diffusion MRI tractography derived white matter bundles and their associated delays. By injecting the EEG measurements as evidence into this model, we are able to estimate the directed dynamical functional connectivity whose delays are supported by the diffusion MRI derived structural connectivity. We present our results in the form of information flow diagrams that trace transient communication between cortical regions over a functional data window. The performance of our algorithm under different noise levels is assessed using receiver operating characteristic curves on simulated data. In addition, using the well-characterized visual motor network as grounds to test our model, we present the information flow obtained during a reaching task following left or right visual stimuli. These promising results present the transfer of information from the eyes to the primary motor cortex. The information flow obtained using our technique can also be projected back to the anatomy and animated to produce videos of the information path through the white matter, opening a new window into multi-modal dynamic brain connectivity."
"In this paper, research progress about the utilization of non-TiO2 photocatalysts in degradation of gaseous VOCs are reviewed. We give a concise overview of several novel non-TiO2 photocatalysts with a focus in their structure, which affect the catalytic activities, including metal oxide, wide bandgap p-block metal oxides/hydroxides, perovskite-type, spinel-type, bismuth based compounds, vanadium based compounds, et al. In addition, the research progress of influence factors of non-TiO2 photocatalytic purification of gaseous VOCs exhaust is summarized from photocatalytic reaction conditions (such as VOCs initial concentration, flow rate, light source, light intensity, reaction temperature and humidity). Finally, the fundamental challenges and perspectives of non-TiO2 photocatalysts are briefly brought up."
A hetero-dinuclear nickel(ii)/lead(ii) complex with a compartmental 'reduced Schiff base' ligand (having inner N2O2 and outer O2O2' compartments) has been prepared and characterized by elemental and spectral analysis. Single crystal X-ray diffraction analysis confirms its structure. Nickel(ii) is placed in the inner N2O2 compartment and lead(ii) is placed in the outer O2O2' compartment of the compartmental reduced Schiff base. The complex forms a tetranuclear supramolecule via non-covalent PbCl tetrel bonding interactions. The DFT study is devoted to analyze these tetrel bonding interactions that involve the sigma-hole at the hemicoordinated Pb(ii) atom. The tetrel bonding interactions have been characterized using Bader's theory of atoms in molecules (AIM).
"The beta 2 auxiliary subunit of voltage-gated sodium channels (VGSCs) appears at early stages of brain development. It is abundantly expressed in the mammalian central nervous system where it forms complexes with different channel isoforms, including Na(v)1.2. From the structural point of view, beta 2 is a transmembrane protein: at its extracellular N-terminus an Ig-like type C2 domain mediates the binding to the pore-forming alpha subunit with disulfide bonds and the interactions with the extracellular matrix. Given this structural versatility, beta 2 has been suggested to play multiple functions ranging from channel targeting to the plasma membrane and gating modulation to control of cell adhesion. We report that, when expressed in Chinese Hamster Ovary cells CHO-K1, the subunit accumulates at the perimetral region of adhesion and particularly in large lamellipodia-like membrane processes where it induces formation of filopodia-like structures. When over expressed in developing embryonic rat hippocampal neurons in vitro, beta 2 specifically promotes formation of filopodia-like processes in dendrites leading to expansion of the arborization tree, while axonal branching remains unaltered. In contrast to this striking and highly specific effect on dendritic morphology, the targeting of functional sodium channels to the plasma membrane, including the preferential localization of Na(v)1.2 at the axon, and their gating properties are only minimally affected. From these and previously reported observations it is suggested that beta 2, among its multiple functions, may contribute to promote dendritic outgrowth and to regulate neuronal wiring at specific stages of neuronal development."
"An efficient method for analyzing illegal and medicinal drugs in whole blood using fully automated sample preparation and short ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) run time is presented. A selection of 31 drugs, including amphetamines, cocaine, opioids, and benzodiazepines, was used. In order to increase the efficiency of routine analysis, a robotic system based on automated liquid handling and capable of handling all unit operation for sample preparation was built on a Freedom Evo 200 platform with several add-ons from Tecan and third-party vendors. Solid-phase extraction was performed using Strata X-C plates. Extraction time for 96 samples was less than 3 h. Chromatography was performed using an ACQUITY UPLC system (Waters Corporation, Milford, USA). Analytes were separated on a 100 mm x 2.1 mm, 1.7 mu m Acquity UPLC CSH C-18 column using a 6.5 min 0.1 % ammonia (25 %) in water/0.1 % ammonia (25 %) in methanol gradient and quantified by MS/MS (Waters Quattro Premier XE) in multiple-reaction monitoring mode. Full validation, including linearity, precision and trueness, matrix effect, ion suppression/enhancement of co-eluting analytes, recovery, and specificity, was performed. The method was employed successfully in the laboratory and used for routine analysis of forensic material. In combination with tetrahydrocannabinol analysis, the method covered 96 % of cases involving driving under the influence of drugs. The manual labor involved in preparing blood samples, solvents, etc., was reduced to a half an hour per batch. The automated sample preparation setup also minimized human exposure to hazardous materials, provided highly improved ergonomics, and eliminated manual pipetting."
"The deterioration of water pipelines leads to impaired water quality, increased breakage rate, and reduced hydraulic capacity. The planning of maintenance programs for water pipelines is essential to minimize health and safety concerns and ensure an adequate supply of water in a safe, cost-effective, reliable, and sustainable manner. It is essential to assess the performance of water pipelines to assist municipalities in planning inspection and rehabilitation programs for their pipelines. Several models have been developed to assess the condition or performance of water pipelines based on several affecting factors. However, none of them considered the interdependency relationships between the factors. Moreover, some models did not account for the factors' weights uncertainty. This paper presents the development of performance assessment models for water pipelines. The models consider three groups of factors affecting water pipeline performance, namely, physical, environmental, and operational. The models were developed using data collected from questionnaire surveys distributed among water pipeline experts in Qatar. The factors' weights were calculated using four different methods, namely, analytic hierarchy process (AHP), fuzzy AHP (FAHP), analytic network process (ANP), and fuzzy ANP (FANP). The results showed that the FANP is the most accurate method since it incorporates the interdependency and uncertainty into the decision making process.

"Determining the dark matter (DM) mass is of paramount importance for understanding dark matter. We present a novel parametrization of the DM speed distribution which will allow the DM mass to be accurately measured using data from weakly interacting massive particle (WIMP) direct detection experiments. Specifically, we parametrize the natural logarithm of the speed distribution as a polynomial in the speed v. We demonstrate, using mock data from upcoming experiments, that by fitting the WIMP mass and interaction cross section, along with the polynomial coefficients, we can accurately reconstruct both the WIMP mass and speed distribution. This new method is the first demonstration that an accurate, unbiased reconstruction of the WIMP mass is possible without prior assumptions about the distribution function. We anticipate that this technique will be invaluable in the analysis of future experimental data."
"Purpose - This study aims to empirically investigate the relationship between the directions of pressures affecting green supply chain management (GSCM) and supply chain (SC) performance. Design/methodology/approach - This re,search is based on a survey because there is no archival database providing detailed information on GSC practices and performance. A survey questionnaire was developed to collect research data, based on the GSC literature and a pilot study in the field. The authors developed hypotheses based on two theories: institutional theory and the resource-based view (RBV). Confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) and structural equation modeling (SEM) were used to test the hypotheses with SPSS (16.0) and AMOS (5.0). Findings - The results confirmed the importance of implementing environmental SC practices to sustain organizations' competitive advantage and performance. Increased SC flexibility helped reduce resources, through decreased cost factors and improved output. Enterprises with environmental SC policies tended to increase SC flexibility and, hence, enhanced profits. Originality/value - This paper applies organizational theories to GSCM by extending the institutional-versus-internal-pressure construct to the way enterprises implement GSC strategies for sustainable SC."
Analytical models for random sources producing far fields with frame-like intensity profiles are introduced. The frames can have polar and Cartesian symmetry and adjustable sharpness of the inner and outer edges. The frames are shape invariant throughout the far zone but expand due to diffraction with growing distance from the source. The generalization to multiple nested frames is also discussed. The applications of the frames are envisioned in material surface processing and particle trapping. (C) 2014 Optical Society of America
"I consider a possibility of parametric amplification of the microwave vacuum field in a reentrant cavity enclosing a nonlinear crystal whose refractive index is modulated by periodic high-intensity short laser pulses. The main result is that the total number of created 'Casimir quanta' depends neither on the laser beam shape, nor on the duration or power of individual pulses, but it depends on the total energy of all the pulses, provided the duration of each pulse is much shorter than the period of field oscillations in the selected resonant mode. The scheme can be feasible if reliable materials with high nonlinear coefficients can be found."
"Eight undescribed isorhamnetin glycosides, acylated with isovaleric acid were isolated from the fruit of sea buckthorn (Elaeagnus rhamnoides (L.) A. Nelson). Structures of the purified compounds were determined using one and two-dimensional NMR spectroscopy, mass spectrometry and chemical methods. In addition, the cytotoxic activity of the phenolic-rich fraction of sea buckthorn fruit and its major flavonoids against colon cell lines, HT-29, HCT-116 and Caco-2, was determined. While the phenolic fraction was moderately active against HT-29 and HCT-116, all investigated purified flavonoids showed significantly weaker activity. This is most probably the first report about isorhamnetin glycosides acylated with isovaleric acid."
"The apparent connection of galectin-3 to chondrocyte survival and osteoarthritis-like cartilage modifications in animal models provided incentive for the mapping of seven members of this family of adhesion/growth-regulatory proteins in human cartilage specimens. Starting with work in vitro, RT-qPCR analyses and immunocytochemistry revealed gene transcription and protein presence in cultured OA chondrocytes, especially for galectin-1, galectin-3 and galectin-8. Immunohistochemistry in clinical specimens with mild and severe cartilage degeneration detected galectins in chondrocytes-with upregulation, especially of galectin-1 in areas of severe degeneration-accompanied by alpha 2,6-sialylation in the pericellular matrix. Given the possibility for additive/antagonistic activities between galectins, these results direct further research toward examining cellular effects of (1) these proteins (alone or in combination) on chondrocytes and (2) remodeling of the chondrocyte glycophenotype."
"We study the explosive expansion near the boundary of the large solutions of the equation <Equation ID=""Equa""> <MediaObject> </MediaObject> </Equation>where is an open bounded set of , N > 1, with adequately smooth boundary, m > p-1 > 0, and f is a continuous nonnegative function in . Roughly speaking, we show that the number of explosive terms in the asymptotic boundary expansion of the solution is finite, but it goes to infinity as m goes to p-1. For illustrative choices of the sources, we prove that the expansion consists of two possible geometrical and nongeometrical parts. For low explosive sources, the nongeometrical part does not exist, and all coefficients depend on the diffusion and the geometry of the domain. For high explosive sources, there are coefficients, relative to the nongeometrical part, independent on and the diffusion. In this case, the geometrical part cannot exist, and we say then that the source is very high explosive. We emphasize that low or high explosive sources can cause different geometrical properties in the expansion for a given interior structure of the differential operator. This paper is strongly motivated by the applications, in particular by the non-Newtonian fluid theory where p not equal 2 involves rheological properties of the medium."
"Employment and hours are more cyclical than dictated by productivity and consumption. This intratemporal labor wedge can arise from product or labor market distortions. Based on employee wages, the literature has attributed the intratemporal wedge almost entirely to labor market distortions. Because wages may be smoothed versions of labor's true cyclical price, we instead examine the self-employed and intermediate inputs, respectively. For recent decades in the United States, we find price markup movements are at least as cyclical as wage markup movements. Thus, countercyclical price markups deserve a central place in business-cycle research, alongside sticky wages and matching frictions."
"The antibacterial screening of Celosia leptostachya Benth leaves was carried out using the agar well diffusion technique and the methanolic extract of the leaves showed considerable activity on Escherichia coli and Staphyllococcus aureus both at 60 and 80 mg/ml with zones of inhibition of 15.50, 18.00 and 16.50, 19.00 mm respectively. Whereas, it showed activity only at a concentration of 80 mg/ml with a zone of inhibition of 17.50 mm on Salmonella typhi. However, the C. leptostachya Benth extract showed no activity on Shigella dysentriae. The phytochemical properties of the extract were also determined. The result reveals the presence of alkaloids, flavonoids, cardiac glycosides, and tannins, whereas phlobatannins, anthraquinones, steroids and saponins were not detected in the extract. The extract contains some major bioactive compound that inhibit the growth of microorganisms thereby proving very effective as alternative source of antibiotics."
"As a result of algae's promise as a renewable energy feedstock, numerous studies have used Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) to quantify the environmental performance of algal biofuels, yet there is no consensus of results among them. Our work, motivated by the lack of comprehensive uncertainty analysis in previous studies, uses a Monte Carlo approach to estimate ranges of expected values of LCA metrics by incorporating parameter variability with empirically specified distribution functions. Results show that large uncertainties exist at virtually all steps of the biofuel production process. Although our findings agree with a number of earlier studies on matters such as the need for wet lipid extraction, nutrients recovered from waste streams, and high energy coproducts, the ranges of reported LCA metrics show that uncertainty analysis is crucial for developing technologies, such as algal biofuels. In addition, the ranges of energy return on (energy) invested (EROI) values resulting from our analysis help explain the high variability in EROI values from earlier studies. Reporting results from LCA models as ranges, and not single values, will more reliably inform industry and policy makers on expected energetic and environmental performance of biofuels produced from microalgae."
"We expand our understanding of the training transfer process by developing the Dynamic Transfer Model (DTM). We develop and examine linkages between intentions to transfer, the initial attempts to utilize training, and the integration of feedback received from the transfer attempt. We propose that this process repeats itself over time in subsequent transfer attempts to impact work behavior and performance. Implications for transfer criteria, the dynamic interaction between the trainee and context, and the personalization of transfer are discussed. Based on the DTM, we suggest future research directions that can enrich our understanding of transfer as well as derive practical implications for improving training effectiveness."
"Thioredoxin system is formed of thioredoxin reductase (E.C 1.6.4.5.; TrxR), thioredoxin (Trx) and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH), and participates in cell growth, apoptosis, antioxidant defense, redox signaling, etc. In this study, cytoplasmic TrxR enzyme was purified by using heat denaturation and 2',5'-ADP Sepharose 4B affinity chromatograph techniques from rainbow trout gill tissues. The purity and the monomer molecular weight of the enzyme were determined with SDS-PAGE. K-M values for NADPH and 5,5'-Dithiobis (2-nitrobenzoic acid), the substrates of the enzyme were calculated by means of Lineweaver-Burk graphic. Optimal pH and optimal ionic strength values were determined as 7.75 and 300 mM, respectively. Then, in vitro effects of the Ni2+, Cu2+, Pb2+, Cd2+, Sr2+, Zn2+, Mg2+, Cr3+, Fe3+, Al3+ and Ag+ metal ions on the enzyme activity were analyzed. IC50 values were determined for the ones showing inhibition effect and their K-i values were calculated by means of Cheng-Prusoff equation."
"A system for shifted excitation resonance Raman spectroscopy (SERRDS) suitable for the application in medical practice for the in vivo detection of carotenoids in human skin is presented. This system comprises a miniaturized (150 mm x 27 mm x 12 mm) handheld probe and a wavelength-tunable diode laser-based 488 nm SHG light source. The diode laser provides two closely spaced excitation wavelengths. In parallel with the resonance excitation of carotenoids in the skin, SERRDS separates the fluorescence background from the Raman peaks. Inhomogeneities of human skin are averaged by the applied spot diameter of 3 mm. The implemented optics are designed for a detection of carotenoids over the whole excitation spot area. The system was calibrated using skin phantoms, resulting in a detection limit of 0.03 nmol g(-1) (beta-carotene per gram of skin/tissue) which is more than one order of magnitude below the average beta-carotene concentration in human skin."
"Background: Migration plays a major role in the emergence and resurgence of lymphatic filariasis (LF) in many countries. Because of the high prevalence of Imported Bancroftian Filariasis (IBF) caused by nocturnally periodic Wuchereria bancrofti and the intensive movement of immigrant workers from endemic areas, Thailand has implemented two doses of 6 mg/kg diethylcarbamazine (DEC) with interval of 6 months to prevent IBF. In areas where immigrants are very mobile, the administration of DEC may be compromised. This study aimed to evaluate DEC administration and its barriers in such areas. Methods: A cross-sectional study with two-stage stratified cluster sampling was conducted. We selected Myanmar immigrants aged > 18 years from factory and fishery areas of Samut Sakhon Province for interview with a structured questionnaire. We also interviewed health personnel regarding the functions of the LF program and practice of DEC delivery among immigrants. Associations were measured by multiple logistic regression, at P < 0.05. Results: DEC coverage among the immigrants was 75 %, below the national target. All had received DEC only once during health examinations at general hospitals for work permit renewals. None of the health centers in each community provided DEC. Significant barriers to DEC access included being undocumented (adjusted OR = 74.23; 95 % CI = 26.32-209.34), unemployed (adjusted OR = 5.09; 95 % CI = 3.39-7.64), daily employed (adjusted OR = 4.33; 95 % CI = 2.91-6.46), short-term immigrant (adjusted OR = 1.62; 95 % CI = 1.04-2.52) and living in a fishery area (adjusted OR = 1.57; 95 % CI = 1.04-2.52). Incorrect perceptions about the side-effects of DEC also obstructed DEC access for Myanmar immigrants. All positive LF antigenic immigrants reported visiting and emigrating from LF-endemic areas. Conclusion: Hospital-based DEC administration was an inappropriate approach to DEC delivery in areas with highly mobile Myanmar immigrants. Incorporating health-center personnel in DEC delivery twice yearly and improving the perceptions of DEC side effects would likely increase DEC coverage among Myanmar immigrants."
"This paper proposes a novel state feedback delay-range-dependent control approach for chaos synchronization in coupled nonlinear time-delay systems. The coupling between two systems is esteemed to be nonlinear subject to time-lags. Time-varying nature of both the intrinsic and the coupling delays is incorporated to broad scope of the present study for a better-quality synchronization controller synthesis. Lyapunov-Krasovskii (LK) functional is employed to derive delay-range-dependent conditions that can be solved by means of the conventional linear matrix inequality (LMI)-tools. The resultant control approach for chaos synchronization of the master-slave time-delay systems considers non-zero lower bound of the intrinsic as well as the coupling time-delays. Further, the delay-dependent synchronization condition has been established as a special case of the proposed LK functional treatment. Furthermore, a delay-range-dependent condition, independent of the delay-rate, has been provided to address the situation when upper bound of the delay-derivative is unknown. A robust state feedback control methodology is formulated for synchronization of the time-delay chaotic networks against the L-2 norm bounded perturbations by minimizing the L-2 gain from the disturbance to the synchronization error. Numerical simulation results are provided for the time-delay chaotic networks to show effectiveness of the proposed delay-range-dependent chaos synchronization methodologies. (C) 2014 ISA.

"A novel floating-gate oxide semiconductor (FLOTOS) memory using a wide-band-gap indium-gallium-zinc oxide (IGZO) is presented for low-power system-on-panel applications. An IGZO thin-film-transistor (TFT) is used as a memory transistor for controlling read current as well as a switching transistor for storing charges in a storage capacitor (C-s). The FLOTOS memory is fabricated using a standard IGZO TFT process without any additional process or mask steps. The proposed precharge-assisted threshold voltage compensation technique makes it possible to realize an infinite number of write cycles and a low-power write operation with a bit-line voltage of 5 V. Furthermore, excellent data retention longer than 10 h is obtained at 60 degrees C even under the worst bias-stress condition of read operation with the ultra low off-state leakage (2.8 x 10(-20) A/mu m) of the IGZO TFTs, which is estimated to be smaller by more than 7 orders of magnitude than that of polycrystalline silicon TFTs.

"Relations between the catalyst structure, acid and catalytic properties of two types of silica (silica gel and layer silica) modified by gamma-ferric oxide nanoparticles of a different size (2-4 and 8-10 nm) were studied in the benzene alkylation by benzyl chloride. The catalysts were characterized by means of Mossbauer spectroscopy, temperature programmed NH3 desorption and diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFT) using CO and CD3CN as test molecules. It was found that the particle size and the silica structure strongly affect the catalytic behavior. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."
"In natural conversation, speakers often mention the same referents multiple times. While repeated referents are produced with less prominence than non-repeated referents, it is unclear whether prominence reduction is due to repetition of concepts, words, or a combination of the two. In the current study, we dissociate these sources of repetition by examining bilingual speakers, who have more than one word for the same concept across their two languages. Three groups of Korean-English bilinguals (balanced, English-dominant, Korean-dominant) performed an event description task involving repetition of referents within a single language (i.e., repetition of word and concept) or across languages (i.e., repetition of concept only). While balanced bilinguals reduced prominence both within and across languages, unbalanced bilinguals only reduced prominence when repetition occurred within a language. These patterns suggest that the degree to which words and concepts are linked within a speaker's language system determines the source of repetition reduction. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

"Background: Whether asymptomatic hemorrhagic transformation (HT) is clinically innocuous, that is, unassociated with clinically detectable neurologic deterioration, remains an open question. To explore this, we examined whether asymptomatic HT affects long-term poor outcome and risk of stroke recurrence. Methods: We consecutively and prospectively enrolled patients with acute ischemic stroke who were admitted to our hospital. Based on clinical and imaging data, patients were diagnosed as having asymptomatic HT, symptomatic HT, or not HT, and the 3 groups were compared in terms of basic clinical characteristics, poor outcome, and stroke recurrence. We constructed Kaplan-Meier survival curves and compared groups by means of log rank tests for significant difference. Results: Of the 1789 patients enrolled, 143 (8.0%) presented with asymptomatic HT, 25 (1.4%) presented with symptomatic HT. These patients with were more likely to be female, to have experienced atrial fibrillation, and to have higher National Institute of Health Stroke Scale score on stroke than were patients without HT. After adjusting for other confounding factors, the risk of poor outcome was significantly higher among those with asymptomatic HT and symptomatic HT than among those without HT. Moreover, patients with asymptomatic HT and symptomatic HT showed a significantly lower cumulative 1-year survival rate than did those without HT (P<.001). The patients showed similar rates of cumulative stroke recurrence at 1 year (P = .673). Conclusions: Asymptomatic HT and symptomatic HT after acute ischemic stroke worsened long-term clinical outcomes, although it did not affect risk of stroke recurrence. These findings suggest that asymptomatic HT should not be considered clinically innocuous."
"In this contribution highly sensitive and quantitative analytical methodologies based on femtosecond Laser Ablation IonizationMass Spectrometry (fs-LIMS) for the analysis of model systems and state-of-the-art Cu interconnects are reviewed and discussed. The method development introduces in a first stage a 1D chemical depth profiling approach on electrodeposited Cu films containing periodically confined organic layers. Optimization of measurement conditions on these test platforms enabled depth profiling investigations with vertical resolution at the nm level. In a second stage, a matrix-free laser desorption methodology was developed that allowed for preliminary molecular identification of the embedded organic contaminants beyond elementary composition. These studies provided specific fragmentation markers in the lower mass range, which support a previously proposed reaction mechanism responsible for successful leveling employing a new class of plating additives for Damascene processes. Further combined LIMS and Scanning Auger Microscopy (SAM) studies on through-silicon-vias (TSV) interconnects confirmed the embedment upon plating of the organic additives at the upper side-walls of the TSV channel in the boundary between the Cu seed layer and the electrodeposited Cu.

"Nanomedical applications of biodegradable poly(DL-lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA) nanoparticles (NPs) developed are discussed in this review. A surface-functionalized PLGA NP platform for drug delivery was established to encapsulate a number of macromolecular drugs such as peptides and nucleic acids as well as low-molecular-weight drugs by the emulsion solvent diffusion method. The interaction of PLGA NPs with cells and tissues could be controlled by changing the surface properties of NPs, suggesting their potential utility for the intracellular drug delivery of nucleic acid-based drugs. Furthermore, orally administered NF-kappa B decoy oligonucleotide-loaded CS-PLGA NPs are also useful in treating experimental colitis. These approaches using surface-modified PLGA NPs could be able to open new possibilities for nucleic acid-based drug delivery via noninvasive administration method."
"Colorectal cancer associated transcript 1 (CCAT1) is a novel long noncoding RNA, whose overexpression is evident in both early phase of tumorigenesis and later disease stages in colorectal cancer (CRC). No study has explored the relationship between CCAT1 polymorphisms and CRC risk. In the present study, a case-control study was conducted to investigate the association between CCAT1 polymorphisms and CRC risk in Chinese population. We identified that CCAT1 rs67085638 polymorphism was associated with an increased risk of CRC (OR = 1.72, 95%CI = 1.14-2.58, P = 0.009 in heterozygote codominant model; OR = 1.67, 95%CI = 1.13-2.47, P = 0.010 in dominant model). Moreover, CCAT1 rs7013433 polymorphism was associated with late clinical stage (OR = 1.82, 95%CI 1.16-2.86, P = 0.009 in heterozygote codominant model; OR = 1.72, 95%CI = 1.13-2.63, P = 0.012 in dominant model). Our finding proposed a link between CCAT1 polymorphisms with CRC risk as well as different clinical stages."
"Utilizing a series of boy-annulated perylene ester imides (PEIs) doped in polyvinylcarbzole (PVK) as emissive layer, host-guest organic light emitting diodes were fabricated and the electroluminescence behaviors of these devices have been explored. The devices exhibited emission from both PVK as well as PEI mainly due to the partial Forster resonance energy transfer from PVK to the emissive dopant. In order to achieve better device performance, two different electron transport layers, BPhen and TPBi were used. A remarkable improvement in the emission brightness and lower turn on voltage was observed, when TPBi was used as an electron-transporting layer instead of BPhen. Incorporation of TPBi resulted in a lower electron injection barrier of TPBi-PVK interface, which facilitates more electron injection into the emissive layer thus resulting in an increased recombination at a comparatively lower voltage. Also, the intensity of blue emission from PVK was enhanced in the case of TPBi based devices, resulting in an overall white electroluminescence, which is of high technological importance."
"We have investigated the temperature and magnetic field dependence of magnetization, specific heat (C-p), and relative sample length change (Delta L/L-0) for understanding the field-induced spin-structural change in quasi-one-dimensional spin chain alpha-CoV2O6 which undergoes antiferromagnetic (AFM) transition below T-N = 15 K. Analysis of C-p(T) shows that an effective S = 1/2 Ising state is realized below 20 K, though the magnetic fluctuations persist well above T-N. C-p and the coefficient of linear thermal expansion (alpha) exhibit strong H dependence in the AFM state. We also observe a huge positive magnetostriction [Delta L(H)/L-0] below 20 K which does not show any tendency of saturation up to 9 T. With increasing field, a sharp and symmetric peak emerges below T-N in both C-p(T) and alpha(T) due to field-induced first-order ferrimagnetic/ ferromagnetic-paramagnetic transitions. The large value of magnetostriction below T-N suggests strong spin lattice, coupling in alpha-CoV2O6."
"Fermi-surface-free superconductivity arises when the superconducting order pulls down spectral weight from a band that is completely above the Fermi energy in the normal state. We show that this can arise in hole-doped cuprates when a competing order causes a reconstruction of the Fermi surface. The change in Fermi surface topology is accompanied by a characteristic rise in the spectral weight. Our results support the presence of a trisected superconducting dome, and suggest that superconductivity is responsible for stabilizing the (pi,pi) magnetic order at higher doping."
"The trypanosomatid parasite Leishmania infantum is the causative agent of visceral leishmaniasis (VL), which is usually fatal unless treated. VL has an incidence of 0.5 million cases every year and is an important opportunistic co-infection in HIV/AIDS. Tyrosine aminotransferase (TAT) has an important role in the metabolism of trypanosomatids, catalyzing the first step in the degradation pathway of aromatic amino acids, which are ultimately converted into their corresponding L-2-oxoacids. Unlike the enzyme in Trypanosoma cruzi and mammals, L. infantum TAT (LiTAT) is not able to transaminate ketoglutarate. Here, the structure of LiTAT at 2.35 angstrom resolution is reported, and it is confirmed that the presence of two Leishmania-specific residues (Gln55 and Asn58) explains, at least in part, this specific reactivity. The difference in substrate specificity between leishmanial and mammalian TAT and the importance of this enzyme in parasite metabolism suggest that it may be a useful target in the development of new drugs against leishmaniasis."
"The interpretation of detrital zircon data is facing some important and potentially damaging inconsistencies that are commonly overlooked: combined U-Pb and Lu-Hf data from detrital zircon in sedimentary rocks have been used successfully to study global processes such as the extraction, growth and preservation of continental crust, suggesting generally similar patterns of evolution in different continents. Yet at the same time, such data are increasingly used to identify the source-rocks of individual clastic deposits, based on the implicit assumption that material from different source terranes carry distinct provenance signatures. For example, Precambrian detrital zircon age-fractions from late Mesoproterozoic to Recent sediments in Laurentia show patterns of U-Pb ages and initial Hf isotope composition indistinguishable from that of zircon from granitoids in Fennoscandia. This is perhaps not too surprising, as Fennoscandia and Laurentia have been near neighbours in three supercontinents (Nuna, Rodinia, Pangea). Transport and homogenization of clastic material in intracontinental basins and along a common continental margin would smooth out differences, and the two neighbouring continents may have closely parallel histories of internal growth. A stronger reason for concern is that Precambrian age fractions in detrital zircon suites from areas as distant as Australia and South Africa also show distribution patterns that cannot be distinguished with confidence from sources in Fennoscandia. These continents have not been near neighbours in post-Archaean supercontinents. Since exchange of detritus between such distant blocks is improbable, one is left with the alternative explanations of pronounced parallel evolution (perhaps related to the assembly of supercontinents in the geological past), or pure coincidence. Whatever the explanation: exchange, parallelism or coincidence, observations such as these challenge the main assumptions underlying the use of zircon as an indicator of sedimentary provenance: That a given age and initial Hf isotopic pattern of a population of detrital zircons can be unequivocally related to a specific first-generation source.

"The results of microbiological, biogeochemical, and isotope geochemical studies in the Kara Sea are described. The samples for these studies were obtained during the 54th voyage of the research vessel Akademik Mstislav Keldysh in September 2007. The studied area covered the northern, central, and southwestern parts of the Kara Sea and the Gulf of Ob. The quantitative characteristics of the total bacterial population and the activity of the microbial processes in the water column and bottom sediments were obtained. The total population of the bacterioplankton (BP) varied from 250000 cells/ml in the northern water area to 3000000 cells/ml in the Gulf of Ob. The BP population depended on the content of the water suspension. The net BP production was minimal in the central water area, amounting to 0.15-0.2 mu g C/(1 day), and maximal (0.5-0.75 mu g C/(1 day)) in the Gulf of Ob. The organic material at the majority of the stations in the Ob transect predominantly contained light carbon isotopes (-28.0 to -30.18%) of terrigenous origin. The methane content in the surface water layer varied from 0.18 to 2.0 mu l CH4/l, and the methane oxidation rate changed in the range of 0.1-100 nl CH4/(1 day). The methane concentration in the upper sediment layer varied from 30 to 300 mu l CH4/dm(3); the rate of the methanogenesis was 44 to 500 nl CH4/(dm(3) day) and that of the methane oxidation, 30 to 2000 nl CH4/(dm(3) day). The rate of the sulfate reduction varied from 4 to 184 mu g S/(dm(3) day)."
"Synthetic Ecology is a novel concept describing the design of de novo ecological communities for a designated purpose. This study is a proof of concept for harnessing Synthetic Ecology in expanding the scale of commercially relevant micro algae (Chlorella vulgaris) cultivation using stable Synthetic Ecologies in open environments as opposed to vulnerable monocultures. We focused on whether the grazing activity of zebra mussels (Dreissena polymorpha) would result in a consistent, and commercially favourable, dominance of Chlorella in cultures that were also inoculated with a competing and potentially invasive cyanobacteria (Synechocystis sp. PCC6803). The key result of this study was that in axenic mixed species co-cultures, zebra mussels had a significantly greater negative effect on Synechocystis cell numbers than Chlorella (P < 0.0001). The zebra mussels' putative preference for Synechocystis over Chlorella suggests they could be used to maintain the dominance of Chlorella in outdoor cultivation systems prone to contamination by invasive cyanobacteria."
"The tea plant, Camellia sinensis (L.), has been cultivated since ancient time and is host to several pest species that can significant reduce productivity. One such pest species is the tea red spider mite. The life cycle of this species, Oligonychus coffeae, Nienter was studied on tea leaves in Darjeeling under laboratory conditions at 20 degrees C and 65% relative humidity. Observations were recorded on freshly laid eggs on tea leaves and continued until individuals reached adulthood. The eggs required an average of 16.17 days to develop into adults. The average longevity of adult was 28.67 days. Our findings contribute to the understanding of mite abundance and population fluctuations in different seasons and climates, and will hopefully help to devise a management strategy for this pest species."
"Compared with other inorganic antibacterial agents, magnesium oxide (MgO) nanopowders exhibit a unique antibacterial mechanism and various advantages in applications, having attracted extensive attention. In this study, MgO nanopowders doped with different ions (Li+, Zn2+ and Ti4+) were synthesized by a sol-gel method, respectively. The structures and morphologies of the as-obtained precursors and nanopowders were characterized and confirmed by X-ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscope (TEM) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis. The influence of three metal ions doping on the antibacterial properties of MgO nanopowders was also investigated by their bactericidal activity against Escherichia coli (E. coli, ATCC 25922) using the broth microdilution method and the agar method. The results show that Li-doped MgO exhibits better antibacterial activity, Zn-doped and Ti-doped MgO display poorer antibacterial activity than pure MgO. It can be concluded that the influence of different ions doping on the antibacterial properties of MgO mainly lies on oxygen vacancies and basicity of nanopowders. (C) 2013 Elsevier B. V.

"The scattering theory approach makes it possible to carry out exact calculations of Casimir energies in any geometry for which the scattering T-matrix and a partial wave expansion of the free Green's function are available. We implement this program for the case of a perfectly conducting elliptic cylinder, thereby completing the set of geometries where electromagnetic scattering is separable. Particular emphasis is placed on the case of zero radius, where the elliptic cylinder reduces to a strip."
"Metals are non-degradable in the aquatic environment and play a vital role in estuarine biogeochemistry but could also be detrimental to associated biota, A comparative evaluation of the trace metal concentrations (Fe, Mn, Zn, Cu, Ni, and Co) was carried out in the Zuari estuary, Goa during the post-monsoon season of 2013 at six locations, each representing three mangrove and three mudflat regions. In addition, fractionation of trace metals in sediments was performed to provide information on the mobility, distribution, bioavailability and toxicity. Special attention was paid to the marine mollusks viz. bivalves and gastropods that are extensively used as bio-indicators in coastal pollution. Considering the percentage of metals in the sequentially extracted fractions, the order of mobility from most to least bioavailable forms was Mn > Zn > Cu > Ni > Co > Fe. Mn maintained high bioavailability (average around 60%) in Fe-Mn oxide and carbonate bound forms indicating that Mn is readily available for biota uptake. The bioavailability of Fe was on an average of around 6% whereas other metals like Cu, Zn, Ni and Co were around 19% to 34%. When the bioavailable values were compared with standard Screening Quick Reference Table (SQUIRT), Zn showed higher toxicity level and bioavailability in the lower estuary. On the basis of calculated Bio Sediment Accumulation Factors (BSAF's), overall trend in bioaccumulation was in the order of Cu > Zn > Mn > Ni > Co > Fe. Metal Pollution Index (MPI) computed was higher for gastropods than bivalves. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."
"Introduction. In this paper, we argue for a novel account of one cognitive factor implicated in delusional cognition. According to the erotetic theory of delusion we present, the central cognitive factor in delusion is impaired endogenous question raising.Method. After presenting the erotetic theory, we draw on it to model three distinct patterns of reasoning exhibited by delusional and schizophrenic patients, and contrast our explanations with Bayesian alternatives.Results. We argue that the erotetic theory has considerable advantages over Bayesian models. Specifically, we show that it offers a superior explanation of three phenomena: the onset and persistence of the Capgras delusion; recent data indicating that schizophrenic subjects manifest superior reasoning with conditionals in certain contexts; and evidence that schizophrenic and delusional subjects have a tendency to jump to conclusions. Moreover, since the cognitive mechanisms we appeal to are independently motivated, we avoid having to posit distinct epistemic states that are intrinsically irrational in order to fit our model to the variety of data.Conclusion. In contrast to Bayesian models, the erotetic theory offers a simple, unified explanation of a range of empirical data. We therefore conclude that it offers a more plausible framework for explaining delusional cognition."
"In this study, we demonstrate a forming technique that enables us to control whether the switching layer of a Pt/In2O3/TiN device is near the Pt electrode or the TiN electrode. This means that In2O3-based resistive random access memory (RRAM) can be switched at either the active or inert electrode. The resistive switching current-voltage (I-V) curves for both electrodes exhibit stable memory windows. Through material and electrical analyses, we found that the reason for switching at the inert electrode is the oxygen-vacancy-rich characteristic of In2O3. Finally, a physical model is proposed to explain this phenomenon. (C) 2017 The Japan Society of Applied Physics"
"We consider pure subnormal operators T of the type studied in Carlsson, 2011, with the additional requirement that sigma(T) has one hole. If ind (T - lambda(0)) = -n for some lambda(0) and n is an element of N, we show that the operator can be decomposed as T = circle plus T-n(k=1)k, where each T-k satisfies ind (T - lambda(0)) = -1, thus extending the classical Beurling-Lax theorem (in which sigma(T) is the unit disc). We also provide a set of unitary invariants that completely characterize T and study the model spaces for the simpler operators T-k."
"Introduction: Fractures shaft femur is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in patients with lower extremity injuries. The objective of this study was to find out the outcome of Interlocking nail in fracture femur. Methods: This study was conducted in the Department of Orthopaedic surgery in M. M. Medical College from July 2006 to November 2008. Seventy eight patients were recruited from Emergency and out patient department having closed fracture of femoral shaft. All patients were operated under general or spinal anesthesia. All patients were followed for nine months. Results: Out of seventy eight patients, sixty nine patients underwent union in 90 to 150 days with a mean of 110.68 days. Touch down weight bearing was started on 2nd post- operative day. Complications found in four patients who had non- union, and fi ve patients had delayed union which was treated with dynamization and bone graft. The results were excellent in 88.46% and good in 6.41% patients. Conclusions: We concluded that this technique is advantageous because of early mobilization (early weight bearing), less complication with good results and is economical."
"Although much of the growing literature on organizational identity implicitly recognizes the normative nature of identity, the ethical implications of organizational identity work and talk have not yet been explored in depth. Working from a meta-ethical perspective, we claim that the dynamic, processual, and temporal activities recently associated with organizational identity always have an ethical dimension, whether ""good"" or ""bad."" In order to describe the ethical dimensions of organizational identity, we introduce the balance theory of practical wisdom as a theoretical framework, and connect this theory to existing organizational identity concepts. We present an empirical case focused on an international paint company to illustrate the relevance of this theory for empirical organizational identity research. Our intention is to expand existing theory by bringing an aspect of organizational identity that has been tangentially acknowledged to the forefront, and by identifying it as a fruitful avenue for future theory development as well as empirical research."
"Between 1906 and 1909 the biologist Ronald Ross and the classicist W.H.S. Jones pioneered interdisciplinary research in biology and history in advancing the claim that malaria had been crucial in the decline of golden-age Greece (fourth century BCE). The idea had originated with Ross, winner of the Nobel Prize for demonstrating the importance of mosquitoes in the spread of the disease. Jones assembled what, today, we would call an interdisciplinary network of collaborators in the sciences and humanities. But early negative reviews of Jones's Malaria and Greek History (1909) by classicists and historians ended the project, despite a positive reception among malariologists. Today, the ""Jones hypothesis'' is often used to exemplify the naivete of past scholarship, and few examine Jones's evidence and reasoning. In this age of renewed interdisciplinarity, a review of what went wrong is timely. Jones and Ross knew they were opening new methodological territory and struggled with the challenges of multiple ways of knowing. Over 100 years later, malaria remains an important site of historical-biological research, yet integration is elusive. After reviewing the Jones-Ross relationship, Jones's interdisciplinary campaign, and the reception of the hypothesis among classicists/ancient historians and in malariology, we conclude by highlighting some of the specific challenges faced by those exploring the interface of biology and history."
"Mitochondrial protein quality control is crucial for the maintenance of correct mitochondrial homeostasis. It is ensured by several specific mitochondrial proteases located across the various mitochondrial subcompartments. Here, we focused on characterization of functional overlap and cooperativity of proteolytic subunits AFG3L2 (AFG3 Like Matrix AAA Peptidase Subunit 2) and YME1L (YME1 like ATPase) of mitochondrial inner membrane AAA (ATPases Associated with diverse cellular Activities) complexes in the maintenance of mitochondrial structure and respiratory chain integrity. We demonstrate that loss of AFG3L2 and YME1L, both alone and in combination, results in diminished cell proliferation, fragmentation of mitochondrial reticulum, altered cristae morphogenesis, and defective respiratory chain biogenesis. The double AFG3L2/YME1L knockdown cells showed marked upregulation of OPA1 protein forms, with the most prominent increase in short OPA1 (optic atrophy 1). Loss of either protease led to marked elevation in OMA1 (OMA1 zinc metallopeptidase) (60 kDa) and severe reduction in the SPG7 (paraplegin) subunit of the m-AAA complex. Loss of the YME1L subunit led to an increased Drp1 level in mitochondrial fractions. While loss of YME1L impaired biogenesis and function of complex I, knockdown of AFG3L2 mainly affected the assembly and function of complex IV. Our results suggest cooperative and partly redundant functions of AFG3L2 and YME1L in the maintenance of mitochondrial structure and respiratory chain biogenesis and stress the importance of correct proteostasis for mitochondrial integrity."
"Objectives. To replicate an evidence-based HIV risk reduction program and assess its impact on 2 behavioral outcomes-inconsistency of condom use and frequency of sex-6 months after the program. Methods. The study was an individual-level randomized controlled trial in which we randomly assigned 850 youths (aged 14-18 years) to 1 of 2 conditions. The treatment (Becoming a Responsible Teen) is a group-level sociocognitive and skills training sexual education course; the control is a general health intervention that includes the same initial informational component as the treatment. Participants were recruited over 3 summers (2012-2014) from a summer employment program in New Orleans, Louisiana, that serves primarily African American adolescents. Results. Six months after program exposure, we found no statistically significant difference between treatment and control group members' self-reported inconsistency of condom use or frequency of sex (P >.05). Conclusions. Although previous evidence has indicated that this particular program can be effective, this study's findings indicate that it was not effective in this setting with this specific population. Results should provide an incentive to learn why the intervention works in some cases and what conditions are necessary for causal impacts."
"A series of porphyrins fused with acenaphthylene, phenanthroline, and benzofluoranthene polycyclic aromatic rings were prepared by means of a 3+1 porphyrin synthesis approach and subsequent retro-Diels-Alder reaction of bicyclo[2.2.2]octadiene-fused precursors. Analysis of the magnetic circular dichroism spectra and the results of time-dependent DFT calculations are used to identify the reasons for the trends observed in the wavelengths and relative intensities of the Q bands of the products. Michl's perimeter model is used as a conceptual framework to explain the changes in the relative energies of the frontier -molecular orbitals."
"This paper explores the dynamic control of a complex multivarlable interacting extractive distillation process with vapor recompression by taking the separation of acetone and methanol using water as separating agent. Results show that the effectiveness of conventional single-end temperature control structure with holding the solvent-to-feed and reflux-to-distillate ratios constant is poor owing to the large product offsets, and a series of improved control structures with composition controller(s) are developed and assessed by inserting the large throughput and feed composition perturbations. In the configuration of composition control loops, there are two crucial issues needed to be solved: one is that which of distillate impurities (methanol and solvent) should be controlled; another is the correspondingly paired manipulated variable (whether solvent-to-feed ratio or reflux ratio). Results illustrate that the effective product quality control is achieved for facing large (20%) disturbances in throughput and feed composition when the distillate methanol and water impurities are controlled by manipulating the solvent-to-feed and reflux-to-distillate ratios for extractive column, while another alternative is infeasible due to the failure of the tuning of the composition controller. And the control scheme with dual-impurity control strategy works better than that with single purity control option in terms of transient product peaks and settling time whether for handling throughput or feed composition disturbances."
"Physarieae, a tribe of mustards with multiaperturate pollen, was investigated phylogenetically for the first time using comprehensive sampling and plastid molecular data. Phylogenetic analyses were employed to test the monophyly of the tribe, to investigate relationships of its seven genera, and to study the evolution of selected morphological traits. Character evolution was inferred using parsimony approaches for nine continuous and three discrete traits related to trichomes, fruits, seeds, and pollen. Two monophyletic chides were recovered within Physarieae: the DDNLS clade, which included five genera (Dithyrea, Dimorphocarpa, Nerisyrenia, Lyrocarpa, and Synthlipsis), and the PP clade, which comprised two genera (Paysonia and Physaria). Under this new phylogenetic context, multiaperturate pollen appeared to be a potential synapomorphy of the tribe. In addition, five continuous fruit and seed traits were identified as new potential synapomorphies for Physarieae. Our analyses also indicated that members of the DDNLS clade present more highly branched dendritic trichomes, narrower replums, longer fruits, and wider seeds, when compared to representatives of the PP clade. Moreover, ancestral state reconstructions of continuous traits in Physarieae showed that seeds became wider and fruits, replums, styles, and seed primary grooves became longer over time."

"Since the late 1990s, the European higher education system has had to face deep structural changes. With the public authorities seeking to create an environment of quasi-markets in the higher education sector, the increased competition induced by recent reforms has pushed all publicly financed higher education institutions (HEIs) to use their resources more efficiently. HEIs increasingly now aim at differentiating themselves from their competitors in terms of the range of outputs they produce. Assuming that different market positioning strategies will have different effects on the performance of HEIs, this article explores the existence of economies of scale and scope in the German higher education sector. Using an input-oriented distance function approach, we estimate the economies of scale and scope and the technical efficiency for 154 German HEIs from 2001 through 2007. Our results suggest that comprehensive universities should indeed orientate their activities to the concept of a full-university that combines teaching and research activities across a broad range of subjects. In contrast, praxis-oriented small and medium-sized universities of applied sciences should specialize in the teaching and research activities they conduct."
"The use of carbon nanotubes as optical probes for scanning near-field optical microscopy requires an understanding of their near-field response. As a first step in this direction, we investigated the lateral resolution of a carbon nanotube tip with respect to an ideal electric dipole representing an elementary detected object. A Fredholm integral equation of the first kind was formulated for the surface electric current density induced on a single-wall carbon nanotube (SWNT) by the electromagnetic field due to an arbitrarily oriented electric dipole located outside the SWNT. The response of the SWNT to the near field of a source electric dipole can be classified into two types, because surface-wave propagation occurs with (i) low damping at frequencies less than similar to 200-250 THz and (ii) high damping at higher frequencies. The interaction between the source electric dipole and the SWNT depends critically on their relative location and relative orientation, and shows evidence of the geometrical resonances of the SWNT in the low-frequency regime. These resonances disappear when the relaxation time of the SWNT is sufficiently low. The far-field radiation intensity is much higher when the source electric dipole is placed near an edge of SWNT than at the centroid of the SWNT. The use of an SWNT tip in scattering-type scanning near-field optical microscopy can deliver a resolution less than similar to 20 nm. Moreover, our study shows that the relative orientation and distance between the SWNT and the nanoscale dipole source can be detected."
"Background Although there have been sporadic reports of patients with hemorrhagic pure sensory strokes (HPSS) in the thalamus and striatocapsular areas, the causes, clinical featuring and long-term outcome have not been adequately investigated Methods We recruited 7 consecutive patients without hemiparetic stroke who had HPSS in the thalamic and striatocapsular areas A CT scan was performed to verify brain imaging patterns, and their causes, clinical featuring and long-term outcome were observed Results We studied 7 patients who had HPSS in the thalamic and striatocapsular areas as seen in CT scans The 7 patients had hypertension, and small hemorrhages were found in the thalamus of 2 patients and in the posterior quarter of the posterior limb of the Internal capsule in 4 patients, only 1 patient had a microhemorrhage in the thalamus The volume of the hemorrhages ranged from 0 3 to 6 3 ml, with a mean of 2 3 +/- 1 9 ml Three patients showed a decreased sense of spinothalamic modality, and position and vibration senses were spared Four patients showed a sensory deficit of both spinothalamic and medial lemniscal type The outcomes were excellent and without post-stroke pain in all patients Conclusion HPSS in the thalamus and striatocapsular area are usually small hemorrhages or microhemorrhages from rupturing of the microvessels or the branches of small vessels HPSS only have an impact on the adjacent sensory nucleus or pathway, and have a good outcome without post-stroke pain Copyright (C) 2010 S Karger AG Basel"
"Novel three-dimensional spherical porous-Bi2WO6 microcrystals were synthesized via a facile hydrothermal method. In order to investigate its adsorption properties, three kind of dyes, such as rhodamine B(RhB), methyl-blue(MB) and methyl-orange(MO) were selected as model pollutant to evaluate its preferential adsorption property. The static adsorption test shows that the as-prepared spherical porous-Bi2WO6 microcrystal possesses higher adsorptivity for the adsorption of MB than that of RhB and CR. According to a series of dynamic and thermodynamic analysis, the adsorption process conforms to the pseudo-second-order kinetic model and Langmuir isotherm model well. Furthermore, adsorption property of RhB, MB, MO, AR, Ph, p-NPh and 2,4-DNPh on Bi2WO6 was also compared and a plausible mechanism of the preferential adsorption property of three-dimensional spherical porous-Bi2WO6 microcrystal was also discussed according to its structure. It is believed that the as-prepared porous-Bi2WO6 microcrystal may provide potential applications in environmental fields. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."
"aSummary: Although heteroplasmy has been studied extensively in animal systems, there is a lack of tools for analyzing, exploring and visualizing heteroplasmy at the genome-wide level in other taxonomic systems. We introduce icHET, which is a computational workflow that produces an interactive visualization that facilitates the exploration, analysis and discovery of heteroplasmy across multiple genomic samples. icHET works on short reads from multiple samples from any organism with an organellar reference genome (mitochondrial or plastid) and a nuclear reference genome."
"The wear behaviors of cubic boron nitride (CBN) abrasive matrices incorporating micrographite particles by resin bonding were investigated. Composite specimens containing 50, 75, and 100 CBN concentrations and 0.1, 1, and 5 wt% graphite were prepared by compression molding. Cu, SiC, and A12O3 were each tested for dressing the CBN composite specimens. A carrier, attached to the spindle of the grinder, was designed and manufactured in a grinding wheel-like shape to hold the CBN composite specimens in place for the grinding processes. The worn surfaces of the CBN composites were examined using scanning electron microscopy. The surface characteristics and wear rate of the CBN composite specimens, as well as the material removal rate and the surface roughness of the SKD11 steel workpiece, were investigated under dry grinding conditions. The experimental results indicated considerable improvement in the processing performance of the graphite-impregnated CBN structure. Workpieces ground by specimens with graphite content below 1 wt% exhibited better surface roughness and topography, as well as higher material removal rates. Only a small amount of the specimen material was consumed, indicating the long lifetime of the grinding wheel. Increased CBN concentration increased the material hardness of the specimens and reduced the consumed material. Using Cu as a dressing material significantly reduced the time necessary to dress the CBN specimen. Wear of the CBN abrasive occurred mainly by the removal of CBN grains from the matrix and the retention of breakage grit on the binding resin."
"Integration of cancer cell imaging and therapy is critical to enhance the theranostic efficacy and prevent under- or overtreatment. Here, a multifunctional gold nanoprobe is designed for simultaneous miRNA-responsive fluorescence imaging and therapeutic monitoring of cancer. By assembling with folic acid as the targeted moiety and a dye-labeled molecular beacon (MB) as the recognition element and signal switch, the gold nanoprobe is folate receptor-targeted delivered into the cancer cells, and the fluorescence is lighted with the unfolding of MB by intracellular microRNA (miRNA), resulting in an efficient method for imaging and detecting nucleic acid. The average quantity of miRNA-21 is measured to be 1.68 pg in a single HeLa cell. Upon the near-infrared irradiation at 808 nm, the real-time monitoring and assessing of photothermal therapeutic efficacy is achieved from the further enhanced fluorescence of the dye-labeled MB, caused by the high photothermal transformation efficiency of the gold nanocarrier to unwind the remaining folded MB and depart the dye from the nanocarrier. The fluorescence monitoring is also feasible for applications in vivo. This work provides a simple but powerful protocol with great potential in cancer imaging, therapy, and therapeutic monitoring."
"Objective: To evaluate the effect of chest size on coronary calcium score (CCS) as assessed with new-generation CT systems from 4 major vendors. Methods: An anthropomorphic, small-sized (300 x 200 mm) chest phantom containing 100 small calcifications (diameters, 0.5-2.0 mm) was evaluated with and without an extension ring on state-of-the-art CT systems from 4 vendors. The extension ring was used to mimic a patient with a large chest size (400 x 300 mm). Image acquisition was repeated 5 times with small translations and/or rotations. Routine clinical acquisition and reconstruction protocols for small and large patients were used. CCS was quantified as Agatston and mass scores with vendor software. Results: The small-sized phantom resulted in median (interquartiles) Agatston scores of 10 (9-35), 136 (123-146), 34 (30-37), and 87 (85-89) for Philips, GE, Siemens, and Toshiba, respectively. Mass scores were 4 mg (3-9 mg), 23 mg (21-27 mg), 8 mg (8-9 mg), and 20 mg (20-20 mg), respectively. Adding the extension ring resulted in reduced Agatston scores for all vendors (17%-48%) and mass.scores for 2 vendors (11%-49%). Median Agatston scores decreased to 9 (5-10), 79 (60-80), 27 (24-32), and 45 (29-53) units, and median mass scores remained similar for Philips at 4 mg (4-6 mg) and Siemens at 8 mg (7-8 mg) and decreased for the other vendors to 13 mg (11-14 mg) and 10 mg (8-13 mg), respectively. Conclusion: This multivendor phantom study showed that CCS can be underestimated up to 50% (49%-66%) for Agatston scores and 49% (36%-59%) for mass scores at a larger chest size, which may be relevant for women and large patients. However, CCS underestimation by chest size differs considerably by vendor. (C) 2015 Society of Cardiovascular Computed Tomography. All rights reserved."
"Layered lithium transition metal oxide LiNi0.5Co0.2Mn0.3O2 cathode materials were successfully obtained through a simple carbonate co-precipitation method. Monodispersed Li[Ni0.5Co0.2Mn0.3]O-2 spherical agglomeration consisted of nanoscale secondary particles enable material to be higher energy and powder density. Pouch-typed cells were assembled to investigate electrochemical performance of Li[Ni0.5Co0.2Mn0.3]O-2 at level of full-cell. The results show that the assembled pouch-typed full-cells present higher capacity, excellent rate capacity, and cycle life, which is due to its monodispersed uniform morphology with nanoscale secondary particles."
7500 tons of municipal solid waste produced in Tehran city is land-filled in Kahrizak disposal site. The leachate of the waste has created a lake with 180000m(3) in volume. A plant is under construction to treat the leachate. A significant amount of biogas can be produced in anaerobic digestion phase in the treatment plant reactor. The designing process of a power plant in accordance with the produced biogas has been discussed in the present study. In the present investigation the air pollution from power plant has also been modeled. The leachate organic load (BOD=34400 mg/L and COD=53900 mg/L) is considerably higher when compared with other countries due to higher amount of organics available in Tehran wastes. The results indicate that an amount of 33504 m(3)/d biogas can be produced in Tehran's landfill that eventually would be sufficient to run a power plant of 3.4 MW capacities. The plant which is designed by Thermoflow software is consisted of two gas turbine units with 2 MW capacities so that the total capacity is 4MW. About 10% of the generated power is for in-plant consumption and the rest can he sold. The results of the air pollution modeling using Screen 3 software reveal that CO and PM amounts are in allowed range but N2O exceeds the standard limits. The high temperature of the outlet gases emitted from gas turbines makes it possible to warm up water and regulate the anaerobic reactors temperature.
"Climate change will further constrain water availability in dry inner-alpine environments and affect water relations and growth conditions in mountain forests, including the widespread larch forests. To estimate the effects of climate conditions on water balance and growth, variation in sap flow and stem radius of European larch was measured for 3yr along an elevation transect from 1070 to 2250m above sea level (asl) in an inner-alpine dry valley in South Tyrol/Italy. Additionally, long-term climate-growth relations were derived from tree cores. Sap flow and radial growth were reduced in dry periods up to an elevation of 1715m, leading to maximum annual growth at 2000m. In a wet year no growth difference between elevations was observed. Long-term tree ring data showed a positive growth response to precipitation up to 1715m and to temperature only above 2000m. Our results demonstrate that reduced water availability and higher atmospheric water demand limit larch at low elevation within dry Alpine regions. This indicates a general upward shift of this species' elevational amplitude upon climate change, and respective negative effects on future silvicultural use and ecosystem services at lower elevations in the European Alps."
"Objective: Does quantitative analysis of the gadoxetate hepatocyte phase homogeneity, measuring percent standard deviation of hepatocyte phase (SDHP) and liver-to-kidney enhancement ratio (LiKER) detect early hepatic fibrosis? Materials and methods: Retrospective review of gadoxetate liver MRI plus biopsy-proven fibrosis within 6 months included 31 reversible hepatic fibrosis, 33 irreversible hepatic fibrosis, and 15 donors. Parenchymal and vascular SDHP and LiKER were measured on the 20-min hepatocyte phase using region of interest. Results: Parenchymal SDHP, vascular SDHP and LiKER measurements differentiate early hepatic fibrosis from controls (P<.01). Conclusion: Quantitative analysis of gadoxetate hepatocyte phase homogeneity using SDHP and LiKER is a promising imaging biomarlcer for diagnosis of early liver fibrosis. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

"Japanese knotweed Fallopia japonica is an extremely abundant invasive plant in Belgium and surrounding countries. To date, no eradication method is available for land managers facing the invasion of this rhizomatous plant. We tested different chemical herbicides with two application methods (spraying and stem injection), as well as mechanical treatments, on knotweed clones throughout southern Belgium. The tested control methods were selected to be potentially usable by managers, e.g., using legally accepted rates for herbicides. Stem volume, height and density reduction were assessed after one or two years, depending on the control method. Labor estimations were made for each control method. No tested control method completely eradicated the clones. Stem injection with glyphosate-based herbicide (3.6 kg ha(-1) of acid equivalent glyphosate) caused the most damage, i.e., no sprouting shoots were observed the year following the injection. The following year, though, stunted shoots appeared. Among the mechanical control methods, repeated cuts combined with native tree transplanting most appreciably reduced knotweed development. The most efficient methods we tested could curb knotweed invasion, but are not likely to be effective in eradicating the species. As such, they should be included in a more integrated restoration strategy, together with prevention and public awareness campaigns."
"The quantum one-time pad (QOTP) usually serves as the quantum encryption to encrypt quantum messages in arbitrated quantum signature (AQS) schemes. The original QOTP is a qubit-by-qubit encryption algorithm with message and encrypted signature always appearing in pair in AQS, which will lead to the vulnerability of the AQS scheme. By comparing the two quantum state pairs in AQS with the C-SWAP attack, it is possible for the attacker to obtain the signer's key, which leads to the security weakness of AQS. Accordingly, we propose a new attack on AQS scheme for the first time. In order to deal with the attack on AQS scheme, QOTP must be replaced by an improved quantum encryption scheme. Based on QOTP with confusion, we proposed an improved quantum encryption scheme which can resist the attack in AQS scheme. Security analysis shows that the improved quantum encryption scheme works efficiently and securely."
"A full-rate burst-mode receiver that achieves fast on/off operation needed for energy-proportional links is presented. By injecting input data edges into the oscillator embedded in a classical Type-II digital clock and data recovery (CDR) circuit, the proposed receiver achieves instantaneous phase-locking and input jitter filtering simultaneously. In other words, the proposed CDR combines the advantages of conventional feed-forward and feedback architectures to achieve energy-proportional operation. By controlling the number of data edges injected into the oscillator, both the jitter transfer bandwidth and the jitter tolerance corner are accurately controlled. The feedback loop also corrects for any frequency error and helps improve CDR's immunity to oscillator frequency drift during the power-on and -off states. This also improves CDR's tolerance to consecutive identical digits present in the input data. Fabricated in a 90 nm CMOS process, the prototype receiver instantaneously locks onto the very first data edge and consumes 6.1 mW at 2.2 Gb/s. Owing to its short power-on time, the receiver's energy efficiency varies only from 2.77 pJ/bit to 3.87 pJ/bit when the effective data rate is varied from 0.44 Gb/s to 2.2 Gb/s. Input sensitivity of the receiver is 36 mV for a BER of 10(-12)."
"Regulation of the activity, location, and interactions of proteins by phosphorylation is crucial for many cellular processes including regulation of signaling. Phosphorylation-dependent interactions between proteins are one outcome of phosphorylation that can contribute to that regulation. Several kinds of phosphopeptide-binding proteins have been characterized, but in plants only by the forkhead-associated (FHA) domain proteins and, predominantly, the 14-3-3 proteins exist. 14-3-3 proteins have been shown to interact with several different classes of phosphorylated target proteins throughout eukaryotes. Initially, plant 14-3-3s were thought to be primarily associated with metabolic enzyme regulation; however, recent years have seen an increasing number of reports describing roles of 14-3-3 proteins in signal transduction, with plant 14-3-3 proteins now shown to interact with key proteins in signaling pathways."
"{110}-oriented yttria-stabilized zirconia single crystals have been implanted with low-energy C ions in an axial direction, at room temperature and at 550 degrees C. Room temperature ion implantation generated a damage layer that contains the expected dislocation loop clusters. Strikingly, the high temperature implantation produced zirconium oxycarbide nanoparticles (ZrCxOy) at a shallow depth in the yttria-stabilized cubic zirconia crystal, with a diameter in the range of 4-10 nm. Moreover, in the high concentration region of implanted C ions, between 100 and 150 nm below the surface, a number of large precipitates, up to 20 nm, were observed. Published by AIP Publishing."
"Context. Small planets around low-mass stars often show orbital periods in a range that corresponds to the temperate zones of their host stars which are therefore of prime interest for planet searches. Surface phenomena such as spots and faculae create periodic signals in radial velocities and in observational activity tracers in the same range, so they can mimic or hide true planetary signals. Aims. We aim to detect Doppler signals corresponding to planetary companions, determine their most probable orbital configurations, and understand the stellar activity and its impact on different datasets. Methods. We analyzed 22 yr of data of the M1.5 V-type star Gl49 (BD+61 195) including HARPS-N and CARMENES spectrographs, complemented by APT2 and SNO photometry. Activity indices are calculated from the observed spectra, and all datasets are analyzed with periodograms and noise models. We investigated how the variation of stellar activity imprints on our datasets. We further tested the origin of the signals and investigate phase shifts between the different sets. To search for the best-fit model we maximize the likelihood function in a Markov chain Monte Carlo approach. Results. As a result of this study, we are able to detect the super-Earth G149b with a minimum mass of 5.6 M-circle plus. It orbits its host star with a period of 13.85 d at a semi-major axis of 0.090 au and we calculate an equilibrium temperature of 350 K and a transit probability of 2.0%. The contribution from the spot-dominated host star to the different datasets is complex, and includes signals from the stellar rotation at 18.86 d, evolutionary timescales of activity phenomena at 40-80 d, and a long-term variation of at least four years."
"Reporters of Cre and/or Flp activity are important for defining the spatial and temporal extent of Cre/Flp-mediated recombination. Here, we describe R26-CAG-LF-mTFP1, a multifunctional fluorescent reporter mouse that strongly expresses mTFP1 (bright teal fluorescent protein) after Cre- and Flp-mediated recombination. To meet the need for single recombinase-mediated reporter expression, we generated derivatives of R26-CAG-LF-mTFP1. The germline excision of the Frt-flanked stop cassette in R26-CAG-LF-mTFP1 generated a Cre-dependent reporter (R26-CAG-LoxP-mTFP1). Similarly, R26-CAG-FRT-mTFP1, in which the loxP-flanked stop cassette was excised in the germline, requires only Flp to activate mTFP1 expression.

"Optimal selection of sustainable materials in construction projects can benefit several stakeholders in their respective industries with the triple bottom line (TBL) framework in a broader perspective of greater business value. Multiple criteria of social, environmental, and economic aspects should be essentially accounted for the optimal selection of materials involving the significant group of experts to avoid project failures. This paper proposes an evaluation framework for solving multi criteria decision making (MCDM) problems with incomplete weight information by extending the combinative distance assessment (CODAS) method with interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy numbers. To compute the unknown weights of the evaluation criteria, this paper presents an optimization model based on the interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy distance measure. In this study, we emphasize the importance of individual decision makers. To illustrate the proposed approach, an example of material selection in automotive parts industry is presented followed by a real case study of brick selection in sustainable building construction projects. The comparative study indicates the advantages of the proposed approach in comparison with the some relevant approaches. A sensitivity analysis of the proposed IVIF-CODAS method has been performed by changing the criteria weights, where the results show a high degree of stability."
"Ageing and atherosclerosis are associated with oxidative stress. Mitochondrial redox function declines with ageing. Here we tested whether ageing LDL receptor knockout mice (LDLr-/-) develop spontaneous atherosclerosis and whether mitochondria' reactive oxygen species (mtROS) correlate with atherosclerosis. Compared with young mice, aged LDLr-/- mice exhibited 20-fold larger aortic lesion size, although the plasma cholesterol levels did not vary between age groups. The lesion sizes increased exponentially from 3 to 24 months of age (r = 0.92, p = 0.0001) and were correlated with mtROS across the age range (r = 0.81, p = 0.0001). Thus, LDLr-/- mice develop spontaneous diet-independent atherosclerosis, that advances exponentially with ageing. We propose that age related increases in mtROS contribute to accelerate atherosclerosis development in hypercholesterolemic mice. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved."
"This study investigates labor union effects on bond yield spreads from perspectives of structural credit models by employing American bond observations from 2001 to 2007. This research finds that union strength significantly and positively relates to bond yield spreads (this effect is roughly equal to that of issuer rating for one standard deviation change when controlling for well-known variables). The empirical results also show that the positive effects become weaker when management has higher bargaining power. Additionally, union strength volatility significantly and negatively relates to bond yield spreads and capital structure (leverage). The above results are robust when controlling for credit ratings, collinearity concerns, industry effect and tax effect. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."
"AFM technique is used to investigate the local interaction between a growing ice front and a single particle, to further elucidate phenomena related to shaping by ice templating and freeze-casting. For that purpose, cantilevers exhibiting spring constants of 0.58 and 0.12 N/m are functionalized (or not) with attached micrometer-sized silica spheres with diameters of 600 nm and 10 mu m. When using deionized water solutions, it appears that the lateral repulsion rate recorded on silica-free cantilevers decreases from 67 to 389 mu m/s (+/- 1%) for pH values of 3 and 6, respectively. At pH 9, an optimum is reached (35 mu m/s). The functionalization of cantilevers does not lead to significant changes. For colloidal alumina suspensions (32 vol% of solid content at natural pH of 8.7, mean size of 400 nm), the effect of deflocculation status is characterized. The more stabilized suspensions exhibit the lowest repulsion rates (from 100 to 230 mu m/s), while the less stable suspensions lead to higher repulsion rates (>= 500 mu m/s). This behavior is consistent with the establishment of a preferential growing path through the loose (open) structure of flocculated particles. AFM appears as an analytical tool of interest to study local phenomena occurring during ice templating of colloidal suspensions."
"Premise of the Study It is unclear to what extent the co-occurrence of angiosperm and gymnosperm species in some marginal ecosystems is explained by reduced growth in angiosperms due to carbon (C) limitation and by high stress tolerance in gymnosperms associated with lack of vessels and resource conservation. Methods We examined growth patterns and traits associated with C balance in four evergreen angiosperm species (including one vesselless species, Drimys winteri) and three gymnosperm tree species of a cold-temperate rainforest in southern Chile. We measured the mean basal area increment for the first 50 (BAI(50)) and the last 10 years (BAI(10)), wood density, leaf lifespan, and nonstructural carbohydrate (NSC) concentrations in different organs. Key Results BAI(50) was 6-fold higher in angiosperms than in gymnosperms and ca. 4-fold higher in Drimys than in the fastest-growing gymnosperm. BAI(10) and aboveground NSC concentrations were significantly higher and leaf lifespan lower in angiosperms than in gymnosperms; these differences, however, were largely driven by the slow growth and low NSC concentrations of the Cupressaceae species (Pilgerodendron uviferum), while the two Podocarpaceae had BAI(10) and NSC concentrations similar to angiosperms. In angiosperms, NSC and starch concentrations were generally higher in species with lower BAI(10), indicating no severe C limitation. Conclusions The co-occurrence of angiosperms and gymnosperms in cold-temperate rainforests of southern Chile is not explained by growth disadvantages and C limitation in angiosperms. Long leaf longevity, but not lack of vessels, appeared to favor resource conservation and C balance in some gymnosperms (Podocarpaceae)."
"Nitrogen-doped porous carbon is prepared by carbonizing polyaspartic acid under inertia atmosphere without template and activation. The powder X-ray diffraction, element analysis, scanning electron microscopy, and N-2 adsorption-desorption tests show that the morphologies and structures of the nitrogen-doped carbon samples deeply depend on carbonization temperature. Electrochemical measurements show that the specific capacitance of the PASP700 sample obtained at 700 degrees C is 166.1 F g(-1) at a current density of 1 A g(-1), and after 5000 charge/discharge cycles it still remains 97% which exhibits an excellent cycling stability.

"We compare the Landauer, Kubo, and microcanonical [J. Phys.: Condens. Matter 16, 8025 (2005)] approaches to quantum transport for the average current, the entanglement entropy, and the semiclassical full-counting statistics (FCS). Our focus is on the applicability of these approaches to isolated quantum systems such as ultracold atoms in engineered optical potentials. For two lattices connected by a junction, we find that the current and particle number fluctuations from the microcanonical approach compare well with the values predicted by the Landauer formalism and FCS assuming a binomial distribution. However, we demonstrate that well-defined reservoirs (i.e., particles in Fermi-Dirac distributions) are not present for a substantial duration of the quasi-steady state. Thus, on the one hand, the Landauer assumption of reservoirs and/or inelastic effects is not necessary for establishing a quasi-steady state. Maintaining such a state indefinitely requires an infinite system, and in this limit well-defined Fermi-Dirac distributions can occur. On the other hand, as we show, the existence of a finite speed of particle propagation preserves the quasi-steady state irrespective of the existence of well-defined reservoirs. This indicates that global observables in finite systems may be substantially different from those predicted by an uncritical application of the Landauer formalism, with its underlying thermodynamic limit. Therefore, the microcanonical formalism which is designed for closed, finite-size quantum systems seems more suitable for studying particle dynamics in ultracold atoms. Our results highlight both the connection and differences with more traditional approaches to calculating transport properties in condensed matter systems, and will help guide the way to their simulations in cold-atom systems."
"Unintended pregnancy remains high in the United States, accounting for one-half of pregnancies. Both contraceptive nonuse and imperfect use contribute to unplanned pregnancies. Long-acting reversible contraception (LARC) have greater efficacy than shorter acting methods. Data from large studies show that unplanned pregnancy rates are lower among women using LARC. However, overall use of LARC is low; of the reproductive age women using contraception, less than 10% are LARC users. Barriers include lack of knowledge and high up-front cost, and prevent more widespread use. Overcoming these barriers and increasing the number of women using LARC will decrease unplanned pregnancies and abortions."
"This study evaluates the May and October 2015 flood prediction skill of a physically based model resembling the U.S. National Water Model (NWM) over the Texas Hill Country. It also investigates hydrometeorological factors that contributed to a record flood along the Blanco River at Wimberley (WMBT2) in May 2015. Using two radar-based quantitative precipitation estimation (QPE) productsStage IV and Multi-Radar Multi-Sensor (MRMS)it is shown that the event precipitation accuracy dominates the prediction skill, where the finer-resolution MRMS QPE mainly benefits basins with small drainage areas. Overall, the model exhibits good performance at gauges with fast flood response from causative rainfall and gauges that are not forecast points in the National Weather Service's Advanced Hydrometeorological Prediction System, showing great promise for forecasts, warnings, and emergency response. However, the model suffers from poor prediction skill over regions without rapid flood response and regions with human-altered flows, suggesting the need to revisit the channel routing algorithm and incorporate modules to represent human alterations. Two contrasting flood events at WMBT2 with similar meteorological characteristics are examined in greater detail, revealing that the location of intense rainfall combined with land physiographic features are key to the flood response differences. Model sensitivity tests further show the record flood peak could be better obtained by tuning the deep-layer soil wetness and the flow velocity field in the river network, which offers hydrometeorological insights into the causes and the complex nature of such a flood and why the model struggles to predict the record flood peak."
"One of the important aspects of decision making and management in distributed systems is collecting accurate information about the available resources of the peers. The previously proposed approaches for collecting such information completely depend on the system's architecture. In the server-oriented architecture, servers assume the main role of collecting comprehensive information from the peers and the system. Next, based on the information about the features of the basic activities and the system, an exact description of the peers' status is produced. Accurate decisions are then made using this description. However, the amount of information gathered in this architecture is too large, and it requires massive processing. On the other hand, updating the information takes time, causing delays and undermining the validity of the information. In addition, due to the limitations imposed by the servers, such architecture is not scalable and dynamic enough. The peer-to-peer architecture was introduced to address these concerns. However, due to a lack of complete knowledge of the peers and the system, the decisions are made without a precise description of the peers' status and are only based on the hardware data collected from the peers. Such an abstract and general image of the peers is not adequate for the purpose of decision making. In this paper, a 4-dimensional model is presented for the purpose of information collection and the exact description of the peer's status, including the features of the peer, the basic activity, the time, and the specifications of the system. The proposed model is for a server-oriented architecture, but it also adapts to the peer-to-peer serverless architecture. Based on this model, a new approach is introduced for information collection and an exact description of the peers' status in a peer-to-peer system based on the Latin square concept. We evaluate the model in the server-oriented and serverless situations. The workload is considered as the basic activity in our evaluation. Our evaluation demonstrates that in a server-oriented situation, increasing the size of the system has a direct relation with time. However, a serverless situation does not follow this behavior."
"The catalytic oxidation technology has been believed as the most promising technology of formaldehyde destruction because of its high. efficiency, thorough destruction and easy application. For the catalytic oxidation technology, formaldehyde was radically destructed by the O-3 and OH radicals, which were produced by various catalytic ways such as photo-catalysis and electro-catalysis. Due to its fundamental importance, the destruction mechanism of formaldehyde by O-3 and OH radicals was investigated in detail by employing quantum chemical calculation in this work. The microcosmic reaction process was calculated and discussed in detail by the UB3LYP/6-31G(d) method and the activation energies were calculated by the QCISD(T)/6-311g(d,p) method. Furthermore, the kinetic parameters were also calculated by the transition state theory. Theoretical results showed that the activation energies of the HCHO + OH reaction (3.57 kcal/mol) was much lower than that of the HCHO + O-3(20.20 kcal/mol) and the rate constant of the HCHO + OH reaction was much larger than that of the HCHO + O-3 reaction. This indicated that the OH radical has much stronger ability to destruct formaldehyde than the O-3 radical, which was in conformity with that the OH radical has much stronger oxidation character than the O-3 radical. Moreover, by comparing, the theoretical results were in agreement with the experimental results in literature, which indicated the theoretical calculation in this work was reasonable and reliable."
"Background: Bacterial infections are common cause of morbidity and mortality in patients with cirrhosis. The early diagnosis of these infections is rather difficult. Aims: To assess the accuracy of acute phase proteins in the identification of bacterial infections. Methods: Concentration of C-reactive protein (CRP), procalcitonin (PCT), lipopolysaccharide-binding protein (LBP), sCD14 and antimicrobial antibodies were measured in serum of 368 well-characterized patients with cirrhosis of whom 139 had documented infection. Clinical data was gathered by reviewing the patients' medical charts. Results: Serum levels of CRP, PCT and LBP were significantly higher in patients with clinically overt infections. Among the markers, CRP -using a 10 mg/L cut-off value-proved to be the most accurate in identifying patients with infection (AUC: 0.93). The accuracy of CRP, however, decreased in advanced stage of the disease, most probably because of the significantly elevated CRP levels in non-infected patients. Combination of CRP and PCT increased the sensitivity and negative predictive value, compared with CRP on its own, by 10 and 5% respectively. During a 3-month followup period in patients without overt infections, Kaplan-Meier and proportional Cox-regression analyses showed that a CRP value of > 10 mg/L (P = 0.035) was independently associated with a shorter duration to progress to clinically significant bacterial infections. There was no correlation between acute phase protein levels and antimicrobial seroreactivity. Conclusions: C-reactive protein on its own is a sensitive screening test for the presence of bacterial infections in cirrhosis and is also a useful marker to predict the likelihood of clinically significant bacterial infections in patients without overt infections."
"Purpose: To describe nurse practitioner (NP) roles in medical rehabilitation settings. Data source: Description of practice by rehabilitation NPs and physicians. Conclusions: NPs increasingly function in medical rehabilitation settings as independent or collaborative care providers. This article describes their roles at a large rehabilitation institute in acute care consultation/liaison, acute rehabilitation, and ambulatory settings. The organization has experienced greater physician efficiency and practice scope, without erosion of subjective or objective quality measures and outcomes. The authors provide specific examples of NP roles in intrathecal baclofen and cancer rehabilitation programs. Implications for practice: Advanced practice nurses can provide efficacious care to people with disabilities, resulting in cost savings, improved outcomes, and high value. Patient care by NPs is beneficial for the physicians so that they may extend their clinical realm, spend more time doing research, and participate in medical leadership."
"Short duration rainfall estimates and their intensities for different return periods are required for many purposes such as for designing flood for hydraulic structures, urban flooding etc. An attempt has been made in this paper to Model extreme rainfall events of Short Duration over Lower Yamuna Catchment. Annual extreme rainfall series and their intensities were analysed using EVI distribution for rainstorms of short duration of 5, 10, 15, 30, 45 & 60 minutes and various return periods have been computed. The Self recording rainguage (SRRGs) data for the period 1988-2009 over the Lower Yamuna Catchment (LYC) have been used in this study. It has been found that EVI distribution fits well, tested by Kolmogorov-Smirnov goodness of fit test at 5 % level of significance for each of the station."
"Objective Intestinal microflora and inflammatory cell infiltrates play critical roles in the pathogenesis of acute colitis. Ceruloplasmin is an acute-phase plasma protein produced by hepatocytes and activated macrophages, and has ferroxidase with bactericidal activities. The goal is to understand the role of ceruloplasmin in colitis progression in a genetically modified murine model. Design Experimental colitis was induced in ceruloplasmin null (Cp-/-) and wild-type (WT) mice by dextran sulphate sodium administration. The role of ceruloplasmin was further evaluated by transplantation of WT macrophages into Cp-/- mice. Results Cp-/- mice rapidly lost weight and were moribund by day 14, while WT mice survived at least 30 days. Colon culture supernatants from Cp-/- mice exhibited elevated levels of TNF alpha, KC and MCP-1, indicative of increased inflammation and neutrophil and macrophage infiltration. Elevated leucocytes and severe histopathology were observed in Cp-/- mice. Elevated protein carbonyl content was detected in colons from Cp-/- mice suggesting ceruloplasmin antioxidant activity might contribute to its protective function. Unexpectedly, intraperitoneal administration of human ceruloplasmin into Cp-/- mice did not afford protection. Bone marrow transplantation from WT mice or injection of isolated peripheral blood monocytes markedly reduced severity of colitis and morbidity in Cp-/- mice. Conclusion Macrophage-derived ceruloplasmin contributes importantly to protection against inflammation and tissue injury in acute and chronic experimental colitis. The findings suggest that defects in ceruloplasmin expression or processing may influence the onset or progression of inflammatory bowel disease in patients."
"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) regulate gene output by targeting degenerate elements in mRNAs and have undergone drastic expansions in higher metazoan genomes. The evolutionary advantage of maintaining copies of highly similar miRNAs is not well understood, nor is it clear what unique functions, if any, miRNA family members possess. Here, we study evolutionary patterns of metazoan miRNAs, focusing on the targeting preferences of the let-7 and miR-10 families. These studies reveal hotspots for sequence evolution with implications for targeting and secondary structure. High-throughput screening for functional targets reveals that each miRNA represses sites with distinct features and regulates a large number of genes with cooperative function in regulatory networks. Unexpectedly, given the high degree of similarity, single-nucleotide changes grant miRNA family members with distinct targeting preferences. Together, our data suggest complex functional relationships among miRNA duplications, novel expression patterns, sequence change, and the acquisition of new targets."
"A new C-3v-symmetric urea-based heteroditopic tripodal receptor capable of recognizing both anions and ion pairs was designed, synthesized, and characterized. The protonated receptor forms a sulfate complex which encapsulates a single DMF in the tripodal cavity of the receptor. However, the SO42- anion is located outside the tripodal cavity and is stabilized by N-H center dot center dot center dot O hydrogen bonds from the urea functions of four receptor cations. With TBAHSO(4) the receptor forms a contact ion pair complex, where both the TBA(+) and SO42- groups are pseudoencapsulated in the tripodal cavity of the protonated receptor. Significantly, the receptor forms a charge-separated polymeric ion pair complex with K+ and HPO42- via formation of a dimeric capsular assembly of the receptor, in which three K+ encapsulated dimeric capsular assemblies interdigitate to form a precise cavity that further encapsulates HPO42-. The receptor also forms an anion complex with CO32- via formation of dimeric capsular self-assembly of the receptor. Solution-state binding studies of the receptor with oxyanions have also been carried out by H-1 NMR titration experiments, which show the oxyanion binding trend HCO3- > H2PO4- > HSO4-, whereas no binding with NO3- and ClO4- anions is observed."
"Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) poses challenges to understanding its underlying cellular and molecular mechanisms and the development of better therapies. Previous studies suggest a pathophysiological role for neuraminidase 1 (NEU1), an enzyme that removes terminal sialic acid from glycoproteins. We observed increased NEU1 expression in epithelial and endothelial cells, as well as fibroblasts, in the lungs of patients with IPF compared with healthy control lungs. Recombinant adenovirus-mediated gene delivery of NEU1 to cultured primary human cells elicited profound changes in cellular phenotypes. Small airway epithelial cell migration was impaired in wounding assays, whereas, in pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells, NEU1 overexpression strongly impacted global gene expression, increased T cell adhesion to endothelial monolayers, and disrupted endothelial capillary-like tube formation. NEU1 overexpression in fibroblasts provoked increased levels of collagen types I and III, substantial changes in global gene expression, and accelerated degradation of matrix metalloproteinase-14. Intratracheal instillation of NEU1 encoding, but not control adenovirus, induced lymphocyte accumulation in bronchoalveolar lavage samples and lung tissues and elevations of pulmonary transforming growth factor-beta and collagen. The lymphocytes were predominantly T cells, with CD8(+) cells exceeding CD4(+) cells by nearly twofold. These combined data indicate that elevated NEU1 expression alters functional activities of distinct lung cell types in vitro and recapitulates lymphocytic infiltration and collagen accumulation in vivo, consistent with mechanisms implicated in lung fibrosis."
"An approach for Eulerian-Lagrangian large eddy simulation of bubble plume dynamics is presented and its performance evaluated. The main numerical novelties consist in defining the gas liquid coupling based on the bubble size to mesh resolution ratio (D-p/Delta(x),) and the interpolation between Eulerian and Lagrangian frameworks through the use of delta functions. The model's performance is thoroughly validated for a bubble plume in a cubic tank in initially quiescent water using experimental data obtained from high-resolution ADV and Ply measurements. The predicted time-averaged velocities and second-order statistics show good agreement with the measurements, including the reproduction of the anisotropic nature of the plume's turbulence. Further, the predicted Eulerian and LagTangian velocity fields, second-order turbulence statistics and interfacial gas-liquid forces are quantified and discussed as well as the visualization of the time-averaged primary and secondary flow structure in the tank.

"In police research, dominant explanations of why law enforcers harbour xenophobic attitudes are most often dressed in cultural or political rationalizations. Based on an ethnographic study of Danish police detectives and their noticeable negativity towards foreign suspects, this article offers an additional explanation of xenophobia. It demonstrates how resentments are spurred not only by cultural prejudice or politics but also by the ways in which foreigners complicate quite ordinary yet, from a police perspective, valued work practices. Following this ethnographic observation, the article ultimately constitutes a call for a better grounding of our criminological theories in the wider context of the workday situations and sensibilities of law enforcement."
"High-performance thermoelectric materials lie at the heart of thermoelectrics, the simplest technology applicable to direct thermal-to-electrical energy conversion. In its recent 60-year history, the field of thermoelectric materials research has stalled several times, but each time it was rejuvenated by new paradigms. This article reviews several potentially paradigm-changing mechanisms enabled by defects, size effects, critical phenomena, anharmonicity, and the spin degree of freedom. These mechanisms decouple the otherwise adversely interdependent physical quantities toward higher material performance. We also briefly discuss a number of promising materials, advanced material synthesis and preparation techniques, and new opportunities. The renewable energy landscape will be reshaped if the current trend in thermoelectric materials research is sustained into the foreseeable future."
"This paper is mainly concerned with the stability of the equilibria of the Allen-Cahn equation where the standard Laplacian diffusion is replaced by the fractional Laplacian diffusion. We shall show that the state is stable with respect to some perturbations which are not too large on a set, but is unstable with respect to some perturbations with bounded support set. We use the comparison principle to obtain the results."
"In-stream processing of allochthonous dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and particulate organic carbon (POC) in peat-sourced headwaters has been shown to be a significant part of the terrestrial carbon cycle, through photo- and bio-degradation, with both DOC and POC converted to carbon dioxide (CO2). This study reports a series of 70-h, in situ experiments investigating rates of degradation in unfiltered surface water from a headwater stream in the River Tees, North Pennines, UK. Half the samples were exposed to the normal day/night cycle (ambient); half were continuously dark. The study found that the DOC concentration of samples in the ambient treatment declined by 64 % over the 70 h, compared with 6 % decline for the samples kept in the dark. For POC, the loss in the ambient treatment was 13 %. The average initial rate of loss of DOC in the ambient treatment during the first day of the experiment was 3.36 mg C/l/h, and the average rate of photo-induced loss over the whole 70 h was 1.25 mg C/l/h. Scaling up these losses, the estimate of total organic carbon loss from UK rivers to the atmosphere is 9.4 Tg CO2/year which would be 0.94 % of the global estimate of CO2 emissions from streams and rivers from the 2013 IPCC report. Initial rate kinetics in the light were as high as 3rd order, but the study showed that no single rate law could describe the whole diurnal degradation cycle and that separate rate laws were required for night and day processes. The comparison of dark and ambient treatment processes showed no evidence of photo-stimulated bacterial degradation."
"In this paper, the removal of the anionic surfactant sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) by coagulation using aluminum sulfate as a coagulant is reported. The effects of factors including pH, SDS concentration, and coagulant dosage on the SDS removal performance were investigated through batch experiments. The dried flocs were characterized by scanning electron microscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, and X-ray diffraction. The results indicate that the redissolution of SDS occurred as the aluminum salt concentration increased and the SDS concentration exceeded the critical micelle concentration. At pH values of 3.0, 4.5, and 6.5, the least effective dosages of coagulant were found to be at CAI/CsDs ratios of 0.33, 1, and 2, respectively. The lowest amount of residual SDS was observed in a pH range of 4.0 to 5.0, and the SDS removal was due to neutralization, complexation, and absorption bridging effects. The SDS removal rate increased with an increase in initial SDS concentration, and the highest removal rate of 99% was obtained with an initial SDS concentration of 0.05 mol L-1 at pH 4.5. These findings reveal that better coagulation performance for SDS with aluminum sulfate can be achieved in a wide pH range by optimizing the reaction stoichiometry."
"To improve the computational accuracy and efficiency of long-time wavefield simulations, we have developed a so-called symplectic interior penalty discontinuous Galerkin (IPDG) method for 2D acoustic equation. For the symplectic IPDG method, the scalar wave equation is first transformed into a Hamiltonian system. Then, the high-order IPDG formulations are introduced for spatial discretization because of their high accuracy and ease of dealing with computational domains with complex boundaries. The time integration is performed using an explicit third-order symplectic partitioned Runge-Kutta scheme so that it preserves the Hamiltonian structure of the wave equation in long-term simulations. Consequently, the symplectic IPDG method combines the advantages of discontinuous Galerkin method and the symplectic time integration. We investigate the properties of the method in detail for high-order spatial basis functions, including the stability criteria, numerical dispersion and dissipation relationships, and numerical errors. The analyses indicate that the symplectic SIPG method is nondissipative and retains low numerical dispersion. We also find that different symplectic IPDG methods have different convergence behaviors. It is indicated that using coarse meshes with a high-order method produces smaller errors and retains high accuracy. We have applied our method to simulate the scalar wavefields for different models, including layered models, a rough topography model, and the Marmousi model. The numerical results show that the symplectic IPDG method can suppress numerical dispersion effectively and provide accurate information on the wavefields. We also conduct a long-term experiment that verifies the capability of symplectic IPDG method for long-time simulations."
"We analyze the persistence of quasi-periodic invariant 2- and 3-tori for the double Hopf (Hopf Hopf) bifurcation by using the KAM method. We prove that in a sufficiently small neighborhood of the bifurcation point, the full system has quasi-periodic 2-tori for most of the parameter sets where its truncated normal form possesses 2-tori. Under appropriate conditions we obtain that the full system also has quasi-periodic 3-tori for most parameters near the Hopf bifurcation curve of its truncated normal form and along the direction of the bifurcation, and these 3-tori bifurcate from invariant 2-tori. We also give concrete formulas on the existence of quasi-periodic invariant 2- and 3-tori, which are based on coefficients of the truncated normal form. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved."
"A detailed XPS analysis has been performed to observe the effect of carbon ion fluences in the formation of beta-SiC by ion implantation. Carbon ion fluences of 1 x 10(17), 2 x 10(17), 5 x 10(17), and 8 x 10(17) atoms/cm(2) at an ion energy of 65 key have been used to implant Si at room temperature. The implanted samples were annealed at 1100 degrees C for 1 h in a mixture of Ar 96% and H-2 4%. The compositional depth profile along with the change in the chemical state of the implanted carbon and silicon in the annealed samples has been measured. The effect of ion fluences in the formation of SiC has been discussed in reference to binding energy shifts and integrated peak intensities of C 1s and Si 2p signals. It has been observed that the implanted carbon is totally consumed to make Si-C bonds for samples implanted at fluences of 1 x 10(17), 2 x 10(17), and 5 x 10(17) atoms/cm(2). However, for the sample at a fluence of 8 x 10(17) atoms/cm(2), a portion of the implanted carbon is found to be in the form of C-C bonds in the compositional depth profile peak position.

"In the frame of the EFDA task HCD-08-03-01, a 5 GHz Lower Hybrid system which should be able to deliver 20 MW CW on ITER and sustain the expected high heat fluxes has been reviewed. The design and overall dimensions of the key RF elements of the launcher and its subsystem has been updated from the 2001 design in collaboration with ITER organization. Modeling of the LH wave propagation and absorption into the plasma shows that the optimal parallel index must be chosen between 1.9 and 2.0 for the ITER steady-state scenario. The present study has been made with n(parallel to) = 2.0 but can be adapted for n(parallel to) = 1.9. Individual components have been studied separately giving confidence on the global RF design of the whole antenna. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."
"The Glock company's newest generation of pistols (G42/43, Gen5) is equipped with so-called ""Glock Marksman Barrels"" (GMB). These barrels feature an enhanced polygonal profile with right-hand twist and a small rifled profile on either side of the main polygonal field impression (Hernandez et al., 2016). Up until now, using the usual methods of comparison (automatic ballistic identification systems, ABIS and comparison microscope) it was difficult to assign bullets fired from a polygonal barrel to their origin with a high evidentiary value (Murdock et al., 1990) [5] (Northcutt, 2010). In this study, test shots from 18 Glock Gen5 pistols (9 Glock 17 pistols and 9 Glock 19 pistols) were compared to examine their differentiability. In addition, a Gen5 Glock 17 pistol was used to shoot 500 cartridges to determine to what degree the first projectile could be matched with the 500th (Zhang and Luo, 2018) [10]. This study was able to demonstrate that the new ""Glock Marksman Barrel"" (GMB) leaves marks of sufficient quality on projectiles to make high evidentiary value assignments of those projectiles to an individual firearm, both by using the comparison microscope as well as with an ABIS (Evofinder (R)). Further, it was possible to assign the cartridge casings to an individual pristine firearm. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."
"Despite the importance of the seniors market, little is known about international senior tourists' post-purchasing behaviors in the airport-shopping industry. The aims of this study were to attain a better comprehension of these customers' repurchase decision formation by employing a Theory of Repurchase Decision-making (TRD) and identify differences in the proposed theoretical framework between senior and non-senior travelers. A field survey was conducted to collect data at international airports. Results of a structural model showed that the TRD has an excellent ability to predict seniors' repurchase intentions; some variables in the model were found to have a significant mediating impact. Additionally, satisfaction was determined to play a prominent role in these decisions. Finally, findings from the test for metric invariance revealed that the proposed theoretical framework significantly differed across senior and non-senior tourist groups, verifying the moderating impact of age. Implications for both researchers and practitioners are discussed."
"Traditional fuzzy clustering algorithms based on objective function is unable to determine the optimum number of clusters, sensitive to the initial cluster centers, and easily sunk into the issue of local optimum. A Fuzzy similarity-based clustering (FSBC) algorithm is proposed in this paper. This method consists three phases: first, the objective function is modified by integrating Fuzzy C-means (FCM) and Possibilistic C-means (PCM) method; second, using the density function from data for similarity-based clustering to automatically generate initial prototype without requesting users to specify; finally, the iteration process optimized by Particle swarm optimization (PSO) to obtain appropriate adjustment parameters that can provide better results, which avoids the local minimum problems of traditional methods. The experimental results on the synthetic data and UCI standard data sets show that the proposed algorithm has greater searching capability, less computational complexity, higher clustering precision."
"ZnO has attracted considerable attention for optical device applications because of several potential advantages over GaN, such as commercial availability of bulk single crystals and a larger exciton binding energy (similar to 60 meV compared with similar to 25 meV for GaN). Recent improvements in the control of background conductivity of ZnO and demonstrations of p-type doping have intensified interest in this material for applications in light-emitting diodes (LEDs). In this paper, we summarize recent progress in ZnO-based LEDs. Physical and electrical properties, bandgap engineering, and growth of n- and p-type ZnO thin films are also reviewed."
"Pemphigus foliaceus (PF) is one of the autoimmune blistering diseases (ABDs) characterised by autoantibodies (Abs) binding to desmoglein (Dsg) 1, resulting in acantholysis and intraepidermal blistering. Several other autoimmune diseases have been reported to occur in patients with ABDs, such as rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, and Grave's disease (1). However, ABD associated with dermatomyositis (DM) is rare. We report here the first case in which the Ab of DM is identified."
"Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is the primary cause of maternal and fetal morbidity and mortality. Insulin resistance (IR) is pivotal to GDM pathogenesis, and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) is a critical regulator of GDM. An increasing amount of evidence indicates that vitamin D deficiency is a risk factor for GDM. However, there are few reports on the effect of IR on GDM placentas. The present study aims to verify that 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1,25(OH)(2)D-3) can ameliorate trophoblast IR by suppressing mTOR signaling. An IR BeWo cell model was established in the presence of high insulin and glucose medium. The IR level and mTOR activation with or without 1,25(OH)(2)D-3 treatment were evaluated. The IR cells exhibited excessive mTOR signaling activation, upregulated inflammatory factor levels, and extensive lipid infiltration. However, 1,25(OH)(2)D-3 reversed mTOR activation and reduced the IR level and lipid infiltration. In addition, 1,25(OH)(2)D-3 treatment in GDM placental explants blocked the aberrant, increased levels of leptin, TNF-, and IL-6. Therefore, 1,25(OH)(2)D-3 treatment protects trophoblasts against high IR mainly through suppressing mTOR signaling, and this mechanism may serve as a potential therapy for patients with GDM."
"The mechanisms and chemoselectivities on the Au(I)-catalyzed intermolecular condensation between homopropargyl alcohols and terminal alkynes were investigated by performing DFT calculations. The reaction was indicated to involve three stages: transformation of the homopropargyl alcohol (R-1) via intramolecular cyclization to the cyclic vinyl ether (R-1'), formation of the C-2-arylalkynyl cyclic ether (P-1) via hydroalkynylation of R-1' with phenylacetylene (R-2), and conversion from P-1 to 2,3-dihydro-oxepine (P-2). The results revealed the origin of the reaction divergence and rationalized the experimental observations that a 1:3 reactant stoichiometric ratio affords P-1 as the major product, whereas the 1:1.1 ratio results in P-2 in high yield. The reactant stoichiometric ratio-controlled divergent reactivity is attributed to different catalytic activities of the gold catalyst toward different reaction stages. In the 1:3 situation, the excess R-2 induces the Au catalyst toward its dimerization and/or hydration, inhibiting the conversion of P-1 to P-2 and resulting in product P-1. Without excess R-2, the Au catalysis follows a general cascade reaction, leading to product P-2. Theoretical results described a general strategy controlling the reaction divergence by a different reactant stoichiometric ratio. This strategy may be enlightening for chemists who are exploring various synthesis methods with high chemo-, regio-, and enantioselectivities."
"This study was designed to verify the factorial structure of a French version of the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory for Children (STAI-C). This inventory being one of the most widely utilised to measure children's anxiety levels, it was believed necessary to obtain statistical clarification concerning this translation and its construction in order to extend its use. The present French version of the STAI-C was administered to 242 eight- to ten-year-old children. The results showed excellent internal consistency for both state anxiety and trait anxiety scales of the inventory. Furthermore, the three-factor model obtained in the original version of the test was confirmed, demonstrating good psychometric properties of this French version. It is hoped that the present translation, here supported by preliminary statistical results, will allow, once further tested, a greater use of the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory for Children in French-speaking environments.

"The industrial production of flax fibers yields two fibrous products: scutched fibers are valuable for their length, fineness and cleanness, while tows are entangled, impure and are low-priced. There is a need for technical data to compare these two kinds of fibers beyond the difference of appearance, and to assess their potential as composite material reinforcements. In this work, we have compared the properties of scutched flax and flax tows from the same batch. The morphology was first assessed by measuring the length, cleanness and fineness of fiber bundles. The tensile properties of single fibers and of unidirectionally reinforced epoxy composites were then measured. The results show that the morphology of flax tows is different from but close to the morphology of scutched flax. Tow bundles were 15% shorter than scutched flax bundles and tow bundles were 25% thicker than scutched flax bundles. The tensile properties of single fibers were in the same range. Tensile properties of the unidirectional composites show a similar evolution of properties versus fiber volume fraction. The use of scutched flax allowed volume fractions of 0.7 to be achieved while tow volume fraction was limited to 0.6. Despite the visual and morphological difference between tows and scutched flax both can be good candidates for composite reinforcement in high performance applications. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

"Cooling is one of the major energy consuming processes in industry; thus the design of efficient and reliable cold energy storage system based on phase change material is an important requirement in many fields. However, the performance of such system is limited by the poor thermal conductivity of most phase change material. This paper provides a novel graphite-phase change material composite sphere, having high thermal conductivity. In this study, two different types of phase change material were used, organic (PureTemp4) and inorganic (water) phase change materials. The measured thermal conductivity of graphite-water and graphite-PureTemp4 composite spheres were 12 and 30 times higher than those of pure water and PureTemp4, respectively. The microstructure of the compressed expanded graphite and graphite-phase change material composites were examined using a scanning electron microscope. The result shows that the phase change material was completely filled the pores and adhered as a thin layer on the graphite surfaces. Differential scanning calorimeter and thermal cycling tests showed no significant changes in thermal properties of the graphite-phase change material composite spheres after 200 thermal cycles. The measured average freezing rates for graphite-phase change material composite and hollow plastic spheres containing the same amount of PCM are 14.42 W and 4.58 W respectively, while for melting are 31.34 and 10.28 W respectively. The super-cooling of water was reduced 2 degrees C by the effect of graphite, however it was totally eliminated in the presence of small amount of silver iodide as a nucleating agent. The use of compressed graphite matrix decreases little the energy density of the phase change material spheres, however the significant heat transfer enhancement override such small decrease in energy density."
"Background: HIV counselling and testing (HCT) is an essential element in the response to the HIV epidemic. There are still major research gaps about the best ways to provide HCT, especially to the youth, and school-based HCT is a model that has been suggested. To make HCT youth friendly and to enhance access to the service, the particular needs of the youth need to be addressed. Aim: To explore the expressed needs of students about school-based HCT service provision. Method: The study was conducted in 6 secondary schools in Cape Town where a mobile HCT service is provided by a non-governmental organisation. In each school, two mixed gender focus groups were held, one with grades 8 and 9 students and one with grades 10 and 11. A total of 91 students aged 13-21 were involved. The focus groups were conducted in the students' home language. All groups were audio-recorded, transcribed verbatim and translated into English. Results: Content data analysis was done and the following themes emerged: (1) Where the students want HCT to be done, (2) How they want HCT to be done and (3) Who should do the counselling. Most students want HCT to be provided in schools on condition that their fears and expressed needs are taken into account. They raised concerns regarding privacy and confidentiality, and expressed the need to be given information regarding HCT before testing is done. They wanted staff providing the service to be experienced and trained to work with youth, and they wanted students who tested positive to be followed up and supported. Conclusion: To increase youth utilisation of the HCT service, their expressed needs should be taken into account when developing a model for school-based HCT."
"Infections with high-risk human papillomaviruses (HPVs) are causally involved in the development of anogenital cancer. HPVs apparently evade the innate immune response of their host cells by dysregulating immunomodulatory factors such as cytokines and chemokines, thereby creating a microenvironment that favors malignancy. One central key player in the immune surveillance interactome is interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta) which not only mediates inflammation, but also links innate and adaptive immunity. Because of its pleiotropic physiological effects, IL-1 beta production is tightly controlled on transcriptional, post-translational and secretory levels. Here, we describe a novel mechanism how the high-risk HPV16 E6 oncoprotein abrogates IL-1 beta processing and secretion in a NALP3 inflammasome-independent manner. We analyzed IL-1 beta regulation in immortalized keratinocytes that harbor the HPV16 E6 and/or E7 oncogenes as well as HPV-positive cervical tumor cells. While in primary and in E7-immortalized human keratinocytes the secretion of IL-1 beta was highly inducible upon inflammasome activation, E6-positive cells did not respond. Western blot analyses revealed a strong reduction of basal intracellular levels of pro-IL-1 beta that was independent of dysregulation of the NALP3 inflammasome, autophagy or lysosomal activity. Instead, we demonstrate that pro-IL-1 beta is degraded in a proteasome-dependent manner in E6-positive cells which is mediated via the ubiquitin ligase E6-AP and p53. Conversely, in E6-and E6/E7-immortalized cells pro-IL-1 beta levels were restored by siRNA knock-down of E6-AP and simultaneous recovery of functional p53. In the context of HPV-induced carcinogenesis, these data suggest a novel post-translational mechanism of pro-IL-1 beta regulation which ultimately inhibits the secretion of IL-1 beta in virus-infected keratinocytes. The clinical relevance of our results was further confirmed in HPV-positive tissue samples, where a gradual decrease of IL-1 beta towards cervical cancer could be discerned. Hence, attenuation of IL-1 beta by the HPV16 E6 oncoprotein in immortalized cells is apparently a crucial step in viral immune evasion and initiation of malignancy."
"The core of the digital transition is the representation of all kinds of real-world entities and processes and an increasing number of cognitive processes by digital information and algorithms on computers. These allow for seemingly unlimited storage, operation, retrieval, and transmission capacities that make digital tools economically available for all domains of society and empower human action, particularly combined with real-world interfaces such as displays, robots, sensors, 3D printers, etc. Digital technologies are general-purpose technologies providing unprecedented potential benefits for sustainability. However, they will bring about a multitude of potential unintended side effects, and this demands a transdisciplinary discussion on unwanted societal changes as well as a shift in science from analog to digital modeling and structure. Although social discourse has begun, the topical scope and regional coverage have been limited. Here, we report on an expert roundtable on digital transition held in February 2017 in Tokyo, Japan. Drawing on a variety of disciplinary backgrounds, our discussions highlight the importance of cultural contexts and the need to bridge local and global conversations. Although Japanese experts did mention side effects, their focus was on how to ensure that AI and robots could coexist with humans. Such a perspective is not well appreciated everywhere outside Japan. Stakeholder dialogues have already begun in Japan, but greater efforts are needed to engage a broader collection of experts in addition to stakeholders to broaden the social debate."
"The most commonly adopted method to test the strength of single sand particles is based on platen experiments. This setup tends to align the loading direction towards the particle minimum axis and provide an upper limit for the breakage stress. This paper numerically bypasses such limitation by using a combined finite and discrete element method (FDEM). FDEM was first validated via a mesh size analysis of a spherical particle and calibrated by in-situ experimental compressions of the single quartz sand particle, where the particle shape was obtained by X-ray micro-computed tomography (XCT) and then imported into the numerical model. Systematic point loading tests were recreated to explore the role of the curvature at contacting points on the breakage behaviour. The simulations allow to probe the same non-spherical particles, i.e., realistic quartz sand and ellipsoid particles, with multiple measurements highlighting the importance of the loading direction, which was inaccessible experimentally. Results show that FDEM can capture not only the crack initiation but also fracture patterns, while taking into account realistic shapes. It is found that the distance between two contact points and their combined curvedness reflecting the particle morphology are the two major factors governing fracture patterns and stresses. When loading is roughly parallel to the minimum principal dimension of particles, the obtained breakage stress and the number of fragments approach the upper limits."
"We present a new approach for synthesis of GaN nanowires and microwires by metal organic chemical vapor deposition via a thin titanium film evaporated onto sapphire substrate prior to growth. Titanium etches a two-dimensional GaN layer deposited at the initial stage and GaN nanowires subsequently emerge at the boundaries of the etched grains. These wires grow at an exceptional elongation rate of 18 mu m/min and extend radially at a rate of 0.14 mu m/min. The GaN layer between the wires grows at a rate of 0.1 mu m/min. High material quality of these structures is confirmed by micro-photoluminescence spectroscopy. We investigate the initial nucleation stage, the time evolution of the wire length and diameter, the length and diameter distributions and speculate about a mechanism that yields the observed growth behavior.

"Objective: Investigated the use of a combined scale (Worry/Depressed and Avoidant scales) from the Autism Spectrum Disorders-Comorbidity for Children (ASD-CC) as a measure of anxiety. Alternative methods of measuring anxiety were examined using the ASD-CC in an ASD population. Methods: Participants included 147 children, age 2-16 years, evincing a mixture of behavior problems. Comparisons between scores on the ASD-CC and Behavior Assessment System for Children, Second Edition (BASC-2) were examined to determine the most efficacious method of measuring anxiety and to establish convergent and discriminant validity. Results: The worry/depressed subscale was the most effective subscale of the ASD-CC to measure anxiety with proven incremental validity over the combined scale. Conclusion: The worry/depressed subscale is the best measure of anxiety utilizing the ASD-CC in children with an ASD. Additionally, convergent and discriminant validity was demonstrated by comparing the scale with similar and dissimilar scales of the BASC-2."
"Thermodynamic models are frequently used for modeling the thermal behavior of building spaces. However, the occurrence of events such as, for example, doors, windows and blinds being opened or closed, can drastically affect the underlying processes that govern the dynamics of temperature evolution of building spaces, rendering current thermodynamic models less effective for control and prediction. This article presents a framework for appropriate model structure and parameter selection that accounts for such discrete disturbances based on the notion of context. Contexts are modeled as discrete configurations, capable of representing different thermodynamic behavior models for a building space. Depending on how context changes, our thermodynamic model transitions through a set of different linear time invariant sub-models. Each sub-model is effective in representing the thermal behavior of the space under a given context and the result is a hybrid automaton that effectively adjusts to the discrete and continuous dynamics of the building environment. We present an application example and use the outputs of EnergyPlus as reference for model performance evaluation. We show, through different context changes, how a context-based model can be used to represent, with reasonable accuracy, the evolution of temperatures in a simulated thermal zone.

"Background/Aims: Acotiamide, a prokinetic drug, is used to treat functional dyspepsia (FD), especially postprandial distress syndrome (PDS). However, a treatment for FD patients with PDS and/or epigastric pain syndrome (EPS) has not been established. We investigated the efficacy of famotidine in combination with acotiamide for FD. Methods: Fifty blindly randomized FD patients received placebo with acotiamide, or famotidine with acotiamide, for 4 weeks. Treatment efficacy was assessed by overall treatment effects (OTE), total, PDS and EPS symptom scores, and impairment of quality of life (QOL). Results: After OTE assessment, patients who felt affected by treatment comprised 40.9 and 57.9% of famotidine and placebo groups, respectively, after 4 weeks' treatment, with no significant difference between groups. A significant decrease was seen in total, PDS, and EPS symptom scores, and in QOL impairment, after 4 weeks' treatment compared with pretreatment scores for famotidine and placebo groups, but was not observed between groups. The proportion of patients showing a >= 50% decrease in EPS symptom scores was greater in the famotidine than that in the placebo group for every observation point, with the greatest difference observed after 2 weeks' treatment. Conclusion: The effectiveness of famotidine and acotiamide combination therapy in FD was similar to the effectiveness of acotiamide therapy alone. (C) 2017 The Author(s) Published by S.

"Aims: Microbial community associated with hydrogen production and volatile fatty acids (VFAs) accumulation was characterized in acidogenic hydrogenesis using molasses wastewater as a feedstock. Methods and Results: Hydrogen and VFAs production were measured under an organic loading rate (OLR) from 19 to 35 g-COD l(-1) day(-1). The active microbial community was analysed using RNA-based massively parallel sequencing technique, and their correlation patterns were analysed using networking analysis. The continuous stirred tank reactor achieved stable hydrogen production at different OLR conditions, and the maximum hydrogen production rate (HPR) was 1.02 L-H-2 l(-1) day(-1) at 31.0 g-COD l(-1) day(-1). Butyrate (50%) and acetate (38%) positively increased with increase in OLR. Total VFA production stayed around 7135 mg l(-1) during the operation period. Although Clostridiales and Lactobacillales were relatively abundant, the HPR was positively associated with Pseudomonadaceae and Micrococcineae. Total VFA and acetate, butyrate and propionate concentrations were positively correlated with lactic acid bacteria (LAB) such as Bacillales, Sporolactobacillus and Lactobacillus. Conclusions: The close relationship between Pseudomonadaceae and Micrococcineae, and LAB play important roles for stable hydrogen and VFA production from molasses wastewater. Significance and Impact of the Study: Microbial information on hydrogen and VFA production can be useful to design and operate for acidogenic hydrogenesis using high strength molasses wastewater."
"We present a detailed investigation on positive-bias temperature stress (PBTS) induced degradation of nitrided hafnium silicate (HfSiON)/SiO2 gate stack in n(+)-poly crystalline silicon (polySi) gate p-type metal-oxide-semiconductor (pMOS) devices. The measurement results indicate that gate dielectric degradation is a composite effect of electron trapping in as-fabricated as well as newly generated neutral traps, resulting a significant amount of stress-induced leakage current and generation of surface states at the Si/SiO2 interface. Although, a significant amount of interface states are created during PBTS, the threshold voltage (V-T) instability of the HfSiON based pMOS devices is primarily caused by electron trapping and detrapping. It is also shown that PBTS creates both acceptor-and donor-like interface traps via different depassivation mechanisms of the Si-3  SiH bonds at the Si/SiO2 interface in pMOS devices. However, the number of donor-like interface traps Delta N-it(D) it is significantly greater than that of acceptor-like interface traps Delta N-it(A), resulting the PBTS induced net interface traps as donor-like.

"This work aims at identifying a set of humoral immunologic parameters that improve prediction of the activation process in HIV patients. Starting from the well-known impact of humoral immunity in HIV infection, there is still a lack of knowledge in defining the role of the modulation of functional activity and titers of serum antibodies from early stage of infection to the development of AIDS. We propose an integrated approach that combines humoral and clinical parameters in defining the host immunity, implementing algorithms associated with virus control. A number of humoral parameters were simultaneously evaluated in a whole range of serum samples from HIV-positive patients. This issue has been afforded accounting for estimation problems typically related to ""feasibility"" studies where small sample size in each group and large number of parameters are jointly estimated. We used nonparametric statistical procedures to identify biomarkers in our study which included 42 subjects stratified on five different stages of HIV infection, i.e., Elite Controllers (EC), Long Term Non Progressors (LTNP), HAART, AIDS and Acute Infection (AI). The main goal of the paper is to illustrate a novel profiling method for helping to design a further confirmatory study. A set of seventeen different HIV-specific blood humoral factors were analyzed in all subjects, i.e. IgG and IgA to gp120IIIB, to gp120Bal, to whole gp41, to P1 and T20 gp41 epitopes of the MPER-HR2 region, to QARILAV gp41 epitope of the HR1 region and to CCR5; neutralization activity against five different virus strains and ADCC were also evaluated. Patients were selected on the basis of CD4 cell counts, HIV/RNA and clinical status. The Classification and Regression Trees (CART) approach has been used to uncover specific patterns of humoral parameters in different stages of HIV disease. Virus neutralization of primary virus strains and antibodies to gp41 were required to classify patients, suggesting that clinical profiles strongly rely on functional activity against HIV."
"Histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACIs) represent a class of promising agents that can improve radiotherapy in cancer treatment. However, the full therapeutic potential of HDACIs as radiosensitizers has been restricted by limited efficacy in solid malignancies. In this study, we report the development of nanoparticle (NP) formulations of HDACIs that overcome these limitations, illustrating their utility to improve the therapeutic ratio of the clinically established first generation HDACI vorinostat and a novel second generation HDACI quisinostat. We demonstrate that NP HDACIs are potent radiosensitizers in vitro and are more effective as radiosensitizers than small molecule HDACIs in vivo using mouse xenograft models of colorectal and prostate carcinomas. We found that NP HDACIs enhance the response of tumor cells to radiation through the prolongation of gamma-H2AX foci. Our work illustrates an effective method for improving cancer radiotherapy treatment. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."
"Hypobicarbonatemia, or a reduced bicarbonate concentration in plasma, is a finding seen in 3 acid-base disorders: metabolic acidosis, chronic respiratory alkalosis and mixed metabolic acidosis and chronic respiratory alkalosis. Hypobicarbonatemia due to chronic respiratory alkalosis is often misdiagnosed as a metabolic acidosis and mistreated with the administration of alkali therapy. Proper diagnosis of the cause of hypobicarbonatemia requires integration of the laboratory values, arterial blood gas, and clinical history. The information derived from the urinary response to the prevailing acid-base disorder is useful to arrive at the correct diagnosis. We discuss the use of urine anion gap, as a surrogate marker of urine ammonium excretion, in the evaluation of a patient with low plasma bicarbonate concentration to differentiate between metabolic acidosis and chronic respiratory alkalosis. The interpretation and limitations of urine acid-base indexes at bedside (urine pH, urine bicarbonate, and urine anion gap) to evaluate urine acidification are discussed.

"The globalization of the palm oil trade poses a menace to the ecosystem integrity of Southeast Asia. In this short communication, we briefly discuss why palm oil certifications may have failed as an effective means to halt forest degradation and biodiversity loss. From a comparison of multiple new datasets, we analysed recent tree loss in Indonesia, Malaysia, and Papua New Guinea, and discovered that, from 2001 to 2016, about 40% of the area located in certified concessions suffered from habitat degradation, deforestation, fires, or other tree damages. Certified concessions have been subject to more tree removals than non-certified ones. We also detect significant tree loss before and after the start of certification schemes. Beyond non-governmental organisations' concern that Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO) and Palm Oil Innovation Group (POIG) certifications allow ongoing clearance of any forest not identified as of high conservation values (HCV) or high carbon stock (HCS), we suggest an alarming and previously overlooked situation, such as that current ""sustainable palm oil"" is often associated with recent habitat degradation and forest loss. In other words, certified palm oil production may not be so sustainable. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."
"Today, there are centralized and decentralized energy supply areas world-wide. Centralized energy supply is provided by united energy grids which cover most habitable areas; they incorporate several types of power sources with centralized control system. Decentralized energy supply areas cover territories disconnected from power grid, and they incorporate only one type of power source. Autonomous diesel power plants (DPP) are nowadays used mainly to power decentralized consumers and consumer groups. DPP basic disadvantages are power production high cost, diesel fuel nonregenerability, greenhouse gas emission and environmental pollution. The possibility of power supply by autonomous power systems combining wind power plants (WPP) and hydro power plants (HPP) as alternative to diesel generation due to hydraulic energy storage advantages has been considered. Autonomous WPP/HPP power system is a combination of WPP, HPP with water-storage reservoir, automatic control system and switchgear, combined by power, infrastructural and data connections. Hydrogen energy storage is considered to be the second energy storage. HPP water-storage reservoir parametrization procedure considering operating specificity of HPP and WPP as a part of power system with hydraulic and hydrogen energy storage has been suggested. Mathematical models for operating modes of WPP, HPP and storage reservoir have been developed, which consider resources, technical and technological features of their performance in decentralized power supply system. Technique for determining storage reservoir backup volume with allowance for wind conditions parameters, WPP features and storage reservoir configuration have been suggested. Method of day-ahead WPP power calculation in solving problem of operational planning of power system operating modes has been suggested. Simulation of WPP/HPP power system operating modes with seasonal-storage reservoir and hydrogen energy storage have been carried out. The suggested techniques could be used for solving design problems to substantiate decentralized power supply system parameters in remote and isolated areas, as well as for evaluating energy efficiency of replacing the existent decentralized power supply systems on the basis of DPP using imported diesel fuel by environmentally safe systems on the basis of local energy resource wind energy and hydraulic energy. The suggested techniques are also focused on solving problem of power system operating modes for operational planning. (c) 2016 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

"The silver maple-American elm floodplain forest spans throughout the floodplains of the Upper Mississippi River System (UMRS). These forests of the UMRS today are less diverse than those of pre-European expansion (ca. early 1800s). Scientists and land managers are concerned about loss of species diversity including mast species such as pin oak (Quercus palustris Muenchh.), swamp white oak (Quercus bicolor Willd.), bur oak (Quercus macrocarpa Michx. Q), pecan (Carya illinoinensis (Wangenh.) K. Koch), and other hickories. The Great Midwest Flood of 1993 maintained species diversity in the lower, unimpounded region of the Upper Mississippi River, providing an opportunity for eastern cottonwood and black willow to regenerate in this portion of the Mississippi River. However, throughout the entire region, floodplain forests of the Upper Mississippi River have become less diverse, and have become dominated by the flood-tolerant and shade-tolerant silver maple (Acer saccharinum L.). The imminent loss of green ash (Fraxinus pennsylvanica Marsh.) to the Emerald Ash Borer (Agrilus planipennis Fairmaire) follows an already changing forest structure due to a disease-related shift of American elm (Ulmus americana L.) from the overstory to the midstory strata. Another invasive, reed canary grass (Phalaris arundinaceae L.), interferes with evolved mechanisms for establishment as it outcompetes trees of the early successional floodplain forest. Further research is needed to create and maintain diverse floodplain forest communities that have been lost under current conditions. Returning flood-prone agricultural lands within the floodplain to the floodplain forest will improve the health and connectivity of the river system, increase the diversity of habitats, and provide flood relief for communities of the Upper Mississippi River."
"The fluctuation conductivity under magnetic fields is studied in RFeAsO (R = Nd, Pr, Sm) superconductors reported in literatures within the lowest Landau level (LLL) scaling approach. The mean filed critical temperature T-c(H) is determined by the crossing point technique. With the determined values of Tc(H). the fluctuation conductivity is scaled within both three-dimensional (3D) and two-dimensional (20) LLL approach. For all the samples studied, the 3D-LLL scaling is found but in a relatively small temperature interval around T-c(H), while 2D-LLL scaling is observed in all other temperature region. These results suggest a 3D-2D crossover of the fluctuation conductivity in RFeAsO superconductors. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."
"This paper sets out a novel challenge to consequentialism as a theory in normative ethics. The challenge is rooted in the ontological claim that consequences of actions do not exist at the time required to be that in virtue of which actions are right or wrong, and so consequences cannot play the role attributed to them by consequentialists. The challenge takes the form of a dilemma. The consequentialist is confronted with a set of propositions she will find individually plausible but incompossible if taken in conjunction with consequentialism. The task is to restore consistency. There are ways of maintaining the view that consequences are right-makers, but they come at the cost of endorsing highly implausible and unattractive theses. Versions of what might be called quasi-consequentialism can be rendered metaphysically coherent, but these are consequentialisms in name only, and they are best seen as components of an account of practical rationality that has strong echoes of traditional Natural Law theory. Since this is unlikely to appeal to contemporary consequentialists, their best bet is to reject consequentialism altogether."
"A field experiment was done at the Research Station of Islamic Azad University, Tabriz, Iran, during 2008 for investigation of responses of seed yield and essential oil constituents of fennel (Foeniculum vulgare) on seed biofertilization with Azospirillum strains and priming with microelements. Fennel seed priming with mieroelements and biofertilization influenced number of umbels per plant, significantly, and maximum increase of 31% was obtained in both A. lipoferum inoculated and primed seeds as compared the control. In biofertilized plants, thousand seed weight ranged between 5.61 g in A. irakense and 5.97 g in A. brasilense. Seed treatment with microelements increased thousand seed weight of fennel up to 7.5%, compared with the control. Mean seed yield of fennel among treatments ranged from 441 to 583 kg ha(-1). In primed and non-primed seeds, response of A. lipoferum and A. brasilense were better than other strains in seed yield. Essential oil yield responded positively with seed biofertilization and priming, and ranged from 16.35 1 ha(-1) in control to 24.78 1 ha(-1) in seeds inoculated with A. lipoferum and primed with mieroelements. Seed priming in the absence of biofertilizer could improve essence yield up to 27.2% as compared to non-treated plants. Content of anethole ranged from 69% in the control to 73.5%, 74%, 75% and 78% in strains of lipoferum, strain 21, brasilense and irakense, respectively. Seed inoculation with A. lipoferum and priming with mieroelements could be successfully manipulated in growth and production of fennel resulting in beneficial changes in quantity and quality of essential oil."
"Owing to the convenient and visual advantages, dye mapping agents are the most popular lymph tracing agents in the current clinic practices. However, limit tissue penetration always leads to hardly detect deeper lymph nodes (LNs), such as regional lymph nodes (RLNs). Therefore, exploring multimodal nanotheranostic agents for diagnosis and treatment of metastatic LNs are desired. In this study, polydopamine-encapsulated gadolinium-loaded multi-walled carbon nanotube (MWCNT-Gd@PDA) were strategically designed for dual-modality mapping guided photothermal therapy (PTT) by positive signal of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) as well as deep black of the nanomaterials providing visual information. PDA, with excellent biocompatibility and biodegradability, can be easily deposited on many kinds of inorganic and organic materials to prepare functional materials. In order to prevent gadolinium ion escaping from the MWCNT, PDA shell was coated on the surface of MWCNT-Gd. Thus, the prepared MWCNT-Gd@PDA nanomaterials were lack of inherent biological toxicity. More importantly, under the guidance of dual-modality mapping, we demonstrated that primary tumors and RLNs could be simultaneously and effectively ablated by near-infrared irradiation to acquire the radical photothermal dissection. The results showed that our nanosystem possessed the precise spatial-temporal selectivity in comparison with conventional surgery and T-2-MRI guided FIT. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."
"The personality high-order concept of core self-evaluations (CSE), which refers to a basic evaluation of one's worth, capability, and effectiveness, has attracted a lot of research interest. Yet little is known about the construct validity of the core self-evaluation scale (CSES) while information on its longitudinal factorial validity is wholly lacking. This study investigated the factor structure of the CSES using both confirmatory and exploratory factor analysis implemented in Mplus program. In addition, the factor loading invariance over time was investigated using exploratory structural equation modeling. Longitudinal data with three follow-ups over 2 years, gathered among university employees (n = 926 (T3)-2,137 (T1)), were used. The results showed that a two-factor solution comprising the sub-dimensions Internal and External self-evaluations fitted to the data better than the alternative factor models. The two-factor solution was also invariant across the three measurements. It is concluded that the CSES could be used as a two-dimensional instead of a one-dimensional scale. Splitting the scale into the two sub-dimensions of Internal and External self-evaluations revealed that the concept has a finer-grained structure than hitherto thought."
"Determination of the sensitivity of a transducer is essential in evaluating its central frequency and effective bandwidth, its electroacoustic conversion capability, or the measurement ability of an ultrasonic test system. In this work, a calibration method based on self-reciprocity is proposed for the determination of transducer sensitivity, which can be applied to both planar and focused transducers. The two-port electrical network of the experimental setup is analyzed, and a simplified measurement procedure is described in which the ""impedance mismatch"" problem is solved, and only input and output currents are needed. An acoustic transfer function is introduced, both to reduce the effects of wave energy loss on the determination of transducer sensitivity and to help extract the effective geometrical parameters of the transducer through these measured output current signals. The effects of diffraction, attenuation, and effective geometrical parameters on sensitivity determination are discussed in this work; the experimental results show that when all these factors are taken into account, accurate sensitivities for both planar and focused transducers can be obtained at various experimental distances."
"Fascinating N-terminal C-alpha-C bond cleavages in a series of nonbasic tyrosine-containing peptide radical cations have been observed under low-energy collision-induced dissociation (CID), leading to the generation of rarely observed x-type radical fragments, with significant abundances. CID experiments of the radical cations of the alanyltyrosylglycine tripeptide and its analogues suggested that the Nterminal C alpha-C bond cleavage, yielding its [x(2) + H](center dot+) radical cation, does not involve an N-terminal alpha-carbon-centered radical. Theoretical examination of a prototypical radical cation of the alanyltyrosine dipeptide, using density functional theory calculations, suggested that direct N-terminal C-alpha-C bond cleavage could produce an ion-molecule complex formed 'between the incipient a(1)(+) and x(1)(center dot) fragments. Subsequent proton transfer from the iminium nitrogen atom in a(1)(+) to the acyl carbon atom in x(1)(center dot) results in the observable [x(1) + H](center dot+). The barriers against this novel C-alpha-C bond cleavage and the competitive N-C-alpha bond cleavage, forming the complementary [c(1) + 2H](+)/[z(1) - H](center dot+) ion pair, are similar (ca. 16 kcal mol(-1)). Rice-Ramsperger-Kassel-Marcus modeling revealed that [x(1) + H](center dot+) and [c(1) + 2H](+) species are formed with comparable rates, in agreement with energy-resolved CID experiments for [AY](center dot+)."
"Aim: To investigate and analyze the anti-inflammatory and antioxidant efficacy of curcumin in experimentally induced middle ear infection. Method: Twenty-four Wistar albino rats with otomicroscopic examination findings within normal limits were included in the study. Study groups were established after Streptococcus pneumoniae was inoculated into the middle ear cavity of all rats. No medication was administered to Group 1, the control group. Group 2 was administered 50 mg/kg/day amoxicillin intraperitoneally. Group 3 was administered 50 mg/kg/day amoxicillin together with 30 mg/kg/day curcumin intraperitoneally. Blood specimens and temporal bones were collected on the 10th day of medication from the 22 rats in which acute otitismedia developed. Serum glutathione peroxidase and superoxide dismutase activities and malondialdehyde levels were measured. Inflammatory cell infiltration, vascular proliferation, and epithelial proliferation were assessed histopathologically in middle ear mucosa specimens, and the results were compared among the groups. Results: Malondialdehyde levels in the group given curcumin were significantly lower than those of the control group, while serum glutathione peroxidase activity was also lower compared to that of the control group. No significant difference was observed among the groups in terms of superoxide dismutase activity. Although there were no significant findings in terms of histopathological data, epithelial proliferation in the groups receiving antibiotherapy was suppressed compared to the control group. Similarly, curcumin was observed to have a positive effect on inflammatory cell infiltration. No significant changes were observed in terms of vascular proliferation. Conclusion: With its wide and safe dose range, curcumin represents grounds for optimism in terms of anti-inflammatory treatment in acute otitis media."
"In a Malthusian environment, per-capita incomes are stagnant, meaning they cannot exhibit sustained growth. However, they can still display volatility and persistence when hit by shocks. This article simulates a Malthusian model with realistic life-cycle structure and stochastic and accelerating growth in land productivity. We find that differences across simulated economies are quantitatively similar to those found in recently compiled data over GDP per capita for several European countries before 1800. This speaks to the relevance of the Malthusian model for understanding preindustrial development in Europe, contrasting with contentions to the contrary in some of the existing literature."
"Among grain legumes, peas (Pisum sativum L.) are highly sensitive to salt stress. Acclimatization of plants to such conditions is mandatory. We provide improved salt stress tolerance response of transgenic pea plants overexpressing the Na+/H+ gene from Arabidopsis thaliana and a positive association with salt-tolerant plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR). In addition to salt stress tolerance and phosphate solubilization, the selected rhizobacterial isolates were identified for indole acetic acid and proline production ability. Seed germination percentage in transgenic pea plants was significantly higher under NaCl challenge. The wild-type (WT) pea plants inoculated with known numbers of viable cells of salt-tolerant PGPR and transgenic pea plants without any inoculation showed better growth performance under salt stress. However, the PGPR-inoculated transgenic plants showed significant increase in growth and biomass compared to the WT counterpart. An increase in antioxidant enzymes, i.e. superoxide dismutase and peroxidases, was observed in PGPR-inoculated transgenic plants under salt stress. We could not see any negative effect of the transgene in pea plants on the growth of associated PGPR. The overall impact of microbe-mediated elicitation responses in transgenic plants, whether at the biochemical or molecular level, may lead to protection against salt stress."
"This study focuses on the structure-property relationship of interfacially polymerized thin-film composite (TFC) membranes. The impact of the polysulfone support layer on the polymerization of the polyamide active layer is investigated systematically and the resulting membrane surface morphology is related to RO separation performance under seawater desalination conditions. Six different TFC membranes with support layers having average pore sizes ranging from 18 nm to 120 nm were fabricated. Cross-flow RO tests showed that salt rejection systematically increased from 80.5% to 99.0% with decreasing support layer pore size. Scanning electron microscopy at high resolution revealed that the ridge-and-valley structure was more pronounced for active layers of TFC membranes prepared with support layers having larger pores. Convective monomer transport during interfacial polymerization is discussed as a possible reason behind the formation of ear- and ridge-like protuberances, of which the latter can apparently be damaging to the inner active layer."
"Satellite-based hyperspectral Earth observation data combined with physically based radiative transfer models have the strong potential to support sustainable agriculture by providing accurate spatial and temporal information of important vegetation biophysical and biochemical variables such as leaf chlorophyll content. To meet this goal, possible error sources in the modelling should be minimized. Thus, the capability of a model to reproduce the measured spectral signals has to be tested before applying any retrieval algorithm. For an exemplary demonstration, the PROSAIL model was employed to emulate the setup of the future EnMAP hyperspectral sensor in the visible and near-infrared (VNIR) spectral region with a 6.5nm spectral sampling distance. Model uncertainties were determined to subsequently exclude those wavelengths with highest mean absolute error (MAE) between model simulation and spectral measurement. For this purpose data from two campaigns were exploited (1) from Nebraska-Lincoln (maize and soybean) and (2) from Munich-North-Isar (maize and winter wheat). A significant increase of accuracy for leaf chlorophyll content (LCC, mu gcm(-2)) estimations could be obtained, with relative RMSE decreasing from 26% (full VNIR range) to 15% (optimized VNIR) for maize and from 77% to 29% for soybean, respectively. We therefore recommend applying a specific model-error threshold (MAE0.01) to stabilize the retrieval of crop biochemical variables."
This study had three objectives: to explore the psychological and physical self-management behaviours of people with mental illness; to identify their motivations for their self-management behaviours; and to develop a framework to understand the generative processes of healthy vs. unhealthy conditions. The participants were eight persons with schizophrenia who were attending psychiatric rehabilitation centres. We conducted semi-structured interviews with the participants on their observations regarding public health nurses' counselling with them. The data were analysed qualitatively. Six categories of health self-management behaviours were identified. The primary motivations that led to the participants' behaviours were getting a job in the near future' or maintaining my current level of living'. The use of their own methods caused unhealthy conditions when health management was excessively strict or there was a discrepancy between their and care providers' recognition of the appropriate level of self-management.
"Building on the notion that people respond to media as if they were real, switching off a robot which exhibits lifelike behavior implies an interesting situation. In an experimental lab study with a 2x2 between-subjects-design (N= 85), people were given the choice to switch off a robot with which they had just interacted. The style of the interaction was either social (mimicking human behavior) or functional (displaying machinelike behavior). Additionally, the robot either voiced an objection against being switched off or it remained silent. Results show that participants rather let the robot stay switched on when the robot objected. After the functional interaction, people evaluated the robot as less likeable, which in turn led to a reduced stress experience after the switching off situation. Furthermore, individuals hesitated longest when they had experienced a functional interaction in combination with an objecting robot. This unexpected result might be due to the fact that the impression people had formed based on the task-focused behavior of the robot conflicted with the emotional nature of the objection."
"Land management agencies commonly use rapid assessments to evaluate the impairment of gravel-bed streams by sediment inputs from anthropogenic sources. We question whether rapid assessment can be used to reliably judge sediment impairment at a site or in a region. Beyond the challenges of repeatable and accurate sampling, we argue that a single metric or protocol is unlikely to reveal causative relations because channel condition can result from multiple pathways, processes, and background controls. To address these concerns, a contextual analysis is needed to link affected resources, causal factors, and site history to reliably identify human influences. Contextual analysis is equivalent in principle to cumulative effects and watershed analyses and has a rich history, but has gradually been replaced by rapid assessment methods. Although the approaches differ, rapid assessment and contextual analysis are complementary and can be implemented in a two-tiered approach in which rapid assessment provides a coarse (first-tier) analysis to identify sites that deserve deeper contextual assessment (second-tier). Contextual analysis is particularly appropriate for site-specific studies that should be tailored to local conditions. A balance between rapid assessment and contextual analysis is needed to provide the most effective information for management decisions."
"This paper studies the generalization of fuzzy closure operators and fuzzy closure systems, introduced by Belohlavek in 2001, and introduces the concepts of strong L-fuzzy closure systems and strong L-fuzzy closure operators. It is shown that a strong L-fuzzy closure system is precisely the fuzzy system in opposition to the crisp system, and a strong L-fuzzy closure operator is a suitable closure operator that has a close relation to a strong L-fuzzy closure system. It is also shown that there is a Galois correspondence between the category of (strong) L-fuzzy closure system spaces and that of (strong) L-fuzzy closure spaces. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

"The rod Outer Segment (OS) disc, an organelle devoid of mitochondria, is specialized in phototransduction, a process requiring a continual chemical energy supply. We have shown that OS discs express functional mitochondrial electron transport chains, FoF1-ATP synthase and the tricarboxylic acid cycle enzymes, all mitochondrial features. Here, we focus on oxygen consumption and adenosine triphosphate (ATP) synthesis by OS discs analysing electron transport chain I-III-IV and II-II-IV pathways, supported by reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide and succinate, respectively. Interestingly, respiratory capacity of discs was measurable also in the presence of 3-hydroxy-butyrrate, a typical metabolic substrate for the brain. Data were supported by a two-dimensional electrophoresis analyses conducted as our previous one, but focused to those mitochondrial proteins that are involved in oxidative phosphorylation. Carbonic anhydrase was also found active in OS discs. Moreover, colocalization of Rhodopsin with respiratory complex I and ATP synthase seems a further step in the characterization of some proteins typical of the mitochondrial inner membranes that are expressed in the rod discs. The existence of oxygen utilization in the outer retina, likely supplying ATP for phototransduction, may shed light on some retinal pathologies related to oxidative stress of the outer retina.

"In this paper we introduce certain new subclasses of multivalent spiral-like functions by means of the concept of k-uniformly star-likness and k -uniformly convexity. We prove the inclusion relations, sufficient condition and Fekete-Szego inequality for these classes of functions. The behaviour of these classes under a certain integral operator is also discussed."
"Decreased cognitive control over prepotent responses has been hypothesized to contribute to ethanol-induced behavioral disinhibition. However, the effects of ethanol on specific cognitive domains associated with decision making have not been extensively studied. We examined the impact of acute ethanol administration on cognitive performance of nonhuman primates. Studies were conducted using 0.2, 0.5, and 1 g/kg intravenous ethanol in rhesus macaques performing touch screen-based tasks examining stimulus discrimination, stimulus reversal, and stimulus response performance. The impact on attentional processing was also evaluated. Ethanol reduced the accuracy of reversal performance marginally at 0.2 g/kg and significantly at 0.5 g/kg. This effect was selective given an absence of impairment on the stimulus discrimination and stimulus response tasks at these doses. Performance on stimulus discrimination was impaired at 1.0 g/kg, which prevented determination of reversal performance. Analysis of post-error response times demonstrated that error processing was impaired at both 0.2 and 0.5 g/kg. Ethanol also increased the number of omissions and delayed responses on an attentional task, suggesting more frequent attentional lapses. These data demonstrate that cognitive function mediated by specific prefrontal cortical brain regions is particularly sensitive to ethanol and suggest specific cognitive mechanisms that may underlie harmful decisions made at low doses of ethanol."
"The CB1 cannabinoid receptor is the most abundant G-protein coupled receptor in the brain and a key regulator of neuronal excitability. There is strong evidence that CB1 receptor on glutamatergic hippocampal neurons is beneficial to alleviate epileptiform seizures in mouse and man. Therefore, we hypothesized that experimentally increased CB1 gene dosage in principal neurons would have therapeutic effects in kainic acid (KA)-induced hippocampal pathogenesis. Here, we show that virus-mediated conditional overexpression of CB1 receptor in pyramidal and mossy cells of the hippocampus is neuroprotective and moderates convulsions in the acute KA seizure model in mice. We introduce a recombinant adeno-associated virus (AAV) genome with a short stop element flanked by loxP sites, for highly efficient attenuation of transgene expression on the transcriptional level. The presence of Cre-recombinase is strictly necessary for expression of reporter proteins or CB1 receptor in vitro and in vivo. Transgenic CB1 receptor immunoreactivity is targeted to glutamatergic neurons after stereotaxic delivery of AAV to the dorsal hippocampus of the driver mice NEX-cre. Increased CB1 receptor protein levels in hippocampal lysates of AAV-treated Cre-mice is paralleled by enhanced cannabinoid-induced G-protein activation. KA-induced seizure severity and mortality is reduced in CB1 receptor overexpressors compared with AAV-treated control animals. Neuronal damage in the hippocampal CA3 field is specifically absent from AAV-treated Cre-transgenics, but evident throughout cortical areas of both treatment groups. Our data provide further evidence for a role of increased CB1 signaling in pyramidal hippocampal neurons as a safeguard against the adverse effects of excessive excitatory network activity."
"Seven biosimilar products have been approved in Japan since the March 2009 publication of the 'Guideline for quality, safety and efficacy assurance of biosimilar products' by the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare (MHLW). Four years previously, the 'Guideline on similar biological medicinal products' was issued in the European Union (EU), and 13 products as of February 2016 have been approved as biosimilar. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved the first biosimilar product in the US in March 2015 and final Guidance was issued at the end of April 2015. Over the past decade, the challenges regarding the development of biosimilar products have been discussed extensively. In this article, the data packages of biosimilar products in Japan are compared with those overseas in order to clarify the concepts used by the Japanese regulatory authority, i.e., the Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Agency (PMDA). The challenges in the development of biosimilar products in Japan are also addressed."
"Background: Mayer-Rokitansky-Kuster-Hauser (MRKH) syndrome, or the congenital absence of uterus and vagina, is the most severe anomaly of the female reproductive tract. It affects 1 in 5,000 females, and is the second most common cause of primary amenorrhea. The etiology remains unknown in most patients, although four single gene defects and some repetitive copy number variants (CNVs) have been identified. Translocations in MRKH patients are very rare, and reported only in three patients previously without breakpoint mapping. We have identified the fourth MRKH translocation patient and are the first to characterize the breakpoints mapped by molecular methods. Results: The proband is a 17-year old white female with agenesis of the uterus and vagina who had a peripheral blood karyotype revealing a de novo balanced translocation 46,XX,t(3;16)(p22.3;p13.3)dn. There were no known related anomalies present in the proband or her family. No CNVs were found by chromosomal microarray analysis, and no genes were directly disrupted by the translocation. DNA sequencing of six nearby candidate genes-TRIM71, CNOT10, ZNF200, OR1F1, ZNF205, and ZNF213-did not reveal any mutations. RT-qPCR of proband lymphoblast RNA for 20 genes near the breakpoints of 3p22.3 and 16p13.3 showed significantly altered expression levels for four genes in the proband compared to three white female controls, after correction for multiple comparisons. Reduced expression was seen for CMTM7 and CCR4 on 3p22.3, while increased expression was observed for IL32 and MEFV on 16p13.3. Conclusion: We have mapped the breakpoints of our t( 3; 16)( p22.3; p13.3) translocation patient using molecular methods to within 13.6 kb at 3p22.3 and within 1.9 kb for 16p13.3 and have suggested 10 nearby genes that become plausible candidate genes for future study."
"Major advancements in the directed self-assembly (DSA) of block copolymers have shown the technique's strong potential for via layer patterning in advanced technology nodes. Molecular scale pattern precision along with low cost processing promotes DSA technology as a great candidate for complementing conventional photolithography. Our studies show that decomposition of via layers with 193-nm immersion lithography in realistic circuits below the 7-nm node would require a prohibitive number of multiple patterning steps. The grouping of vias through templated DSA can resolve local conflicts in high density areas, limiting the number of required masks, and thus cutting a great deal of the associated costs. A design method for DSA via patterning in sub-7-nm nodes is discussed. We present options to expand the list of usable DSA templates and we formulate cost functions and algorithms for the optimal DSA-aware via layout decomposition. The proposed method works a posteriori, after place-and-route, allowing for fast practical implementation. We tested this method on a fully routed 32-bit processor designed for sub-7 nm technology nodes. Our results demonstrate a reduction of up to four lithography masks when compared to conventional non-DSA-aware decomposition. (C) 2016 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE)"
"Nowadays, there is increasing interest in using calcium hydroxide (Ca(OH)(2)) nanoparticles rather than normal-sized Ca(OH) (2) because of its higher antimicrobial activities. However, the genotoxicity of Ca(OH) (2) nanoparticles has not been well investigated. Therefore, this study was performed to estimate the possible genomic instability and mitochondrial DNA damage induction by normal and nano-sized Ca(OH) (2) particles in mice. Oral administration of normal or nano-sized Ca(OH) (2) particles induced DNA breakages and apoptosis causing genomic instability as a result of increased Calcium content, ROS and MDA levels and decreased SOD and Gpx activities reversely proportional to Ca(OH) (2) particles size in the liver, brain and bone marrow tissues. However, decreases in mitochondrial membrane potential concurrently with downregulated expression of POLG, POLG1 and TFAM genes were only observed in the brain and bone marrow tissues confirmed mitochondrial DNA damage. In contrast, the expressions of POLG, POLG1 and TFAM genes have been improved and mitochondrial membrane potential has not unchanged in liver tissues. Conclusion: single oral administration of normal or nano-sized Ca (OH) (2) particles induced genomic instability through ROS generation that exhausted the antioxidant defense system in the liver, brain and bone marrow tissues but impaired the mitochondrial DNA only in the brain and bone marrow tissues."
"Since at least the middle of the 19th century clinicians have been interested in the symptoms expressed by individuals following exposure to situations inducing severe and chronic stress (trauma). The symptom cluster has been labelled differently over the years. The current diagnosis of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) refers to these symptoms. Although not formally noted in the diagnostic categories, the literature has included much discussion of complex of PTSD (C-PTSD), also often referred to as disorders extreme stress not otherwise specific (DESNOS). The linking of PTSD and C-PTSD to early developmental environments represents an important step in understanding the individual's susceptibility to subsequent stress. The focus of clinical assistance has generally settled on the symptomatic individual. Various treatment approaches and techniques have been applied with varying results. The notion that the individual symptoms might be addressed with therapeutic processes applied beyond the individual to the relationship systems, particularly the family, in which the symptomatic individual lives and functions, has received less attention. The idea of chronic anxiety, included in Bowen's discussion of the relationship between anxiety and family relational activity (Bowen, ), provides a conceptual framework fromwhich specific therapeutic processes directed to the relationship system itself can be hypothesised and implemented."
"The identification of early markers that predict the development of specific social trajectories is critical to understand the developmental and neurobiological underpinnings of healthy social development. We investigated, in infant rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta), whether newborns' capacity to imitate facial gestures is a valid predictive marker for the emergence of social competencies later in development, at one year of age. Here we first assessed whether infant macaques (N = 126) imitate lipsmacking gestures (a macaque affiliative expression) performed by a human experimenter in their first week of life. We then collected data on infants' social interactions (aggression, grooming, and play) and self-scratching (a proxy indicator of anxiety) at 11-14 months when infants were transferred into a new enclosure with a large social group. Our results show that neonatal imitators exhibit more dominant behaviours, are less anxious, and, for males only, spend more time in play at one year old. These findings suggest that neonatal imitation may be an early predictor of infant sociality and may help identify infants at risk of neurodevelopmental social deficits."
"The influence of sperm morphology and chromatin integrity on bull fertility suggests a strong but undefined biological relationship between these two parameters. In this study we explore this relationship, making use of the Sperm Chromatin Dispersion test, which allows simultaneous observation of sperm abnormalities and DNA fragmentation. Based on spermatozoa from 17 Holstein-Friesian bulls, we determined a relationship between DNA fragmentation and the presence of the ""so called"" major-type sperm defects. Values for DNA fragmentation index (mean +/- SEM) calculated from cells with major-type abnormalities were significantly (P < 0.05) higher (85.05 +/- 5.00%) than those from abnormal forms classified as minor-type (17.89 +/- 5.55%). Some of the sperm abnormalities, such as double forms, narrow base heads, small heads, shortened tails and proximal cytoplasmic droplets, were only associated with sperm showing fragmented DNA. The simultaneous assessment of sperm morphology and DNA fragmentation has the potential to improve the efficacy of sperm quality assessment in this species. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

"Intralesional use of cidofovir (Vistide(A (R))) has been one of the mainstays of adjuvant therapy in patients with recurrent respiratory papillomatosis (RRP) since 1998. In 2011, a communication provided by the producer of cidofovir addressed very serious side effects concerning its off-label use. As this was a general warning, it was inconclusive whether this would account for its use in RRP. The aim of this study is to determine whether nephrotoxic, neutropenic, or oncogenic side effects have occurred after intralesional use of cidofovir in patients with RRP. Update of recent developments in RRP, a multicentre questionnaire and a multicentre retrospective chart review. Sixteen hospitals from eleven countries worldwide submitted records of 635 RRP patients, of whom 275 were treated with cidofovir. RRP patients received a median of three intralesional injections (interquartile range 2-6). There were no statistical differences in occurrence of neutropenia or renal dysfunction before and after cidofovir. There was no statistical difference in occurrence of upper airway and tracheal malignancies between the cidofovir and the non-cidofovir group. In this retrospective patient chart review, no clinical evidence was found for more long-term nephrotoxicity, neutropenia or laryngeal malignancies after the administration of intralesional cidofovir in RRP patients."
"The predator-prey space game and the costs associated with risk effects are affected by prey 1) proactive adjustments (when prey modify their behaviour in response to an a priori assessment of the risk level) and 2) reactive adjustments (when prey have detected an immediate threat). Proactive adjustments are generally well-studied, whereas the frequency, strength and duration of reactive adjustments remain largely unknown. We studied the space use and habitat selection of GPS-collared zebras Equus quagga from 2 to 48 h after an encounter with lions Panthera leo. Lion-zebra encounters generally occurred close to artificial waterholes (<1 km). Two hours after an encounter, zebras were more likely to have fled than stay when the encounter occurred in more risky bushy areas. During their flight, zebras selected grasslands more than usual, getting great visibility. Regardless of their initial response, zebras finally fled at the end of the night and reached areas located far from waterholes where encounters with lions are less frequent. The large-scale flights (similar to 4-5 km) of zebras led to a local zebra depression for lions. Zebras that had fled immediately after the encounter resumed their behaviour of coming close to waterholes on the following day. However, zebras that had initially stayed remained far from waterholes for an extra 24 h, remaining an elusive prey for longer. The delay in the flight decision had different short-term consequences on the lion-zebra game. We reveal that the spatial context of the encounter shapes the immediate response of prey, and that encountering predators induces strong behavioural responses: prey flee towards distant, safer, areas and have a constrained use of key resource areas which are at the heart of the predator-prey game at larger spatio-temporal scales. Nighttime encounters were infrequent (once every 35 days on average), zebra responses were short-lived (<36 h) but occurred over a large spatial scale (several km)."
"In this Note, we present an efficient method to approximate the expectation of the response of a one-dimensional elliptic problem with stochastic inputs. In conventional methods, the computational effort and cost of the approximation of the response can be dramatic. Our method presented here is based on the Karhunen-Loeve (K-L) expansion of the inverse of the diffusion parameter, allowing us to build a base of random variables in reduced numbers, from which we construct a projected solution. We show that the expectation of this projected solution is a good approximation, and give an a priori error estimate. A numerical example is presented to show the efficiency of this approach.

"Voltage-gated sodium channels (VGSCs) play a key role in the initiation and propagation of action potentials in neurons. Na(V)1.8 is a tetrodotoxin (TTX) resistant VGSC expressed in nociceptors, peripheral small-diameter neurons able to detect noxious stimuli. Na(V)1.8 underlies the vast majority of sodium currents during action potentials. Many studies have highlighted a key role for Na(V)1.8 in inflammatory and chronic pain models. Lipid rafts are microdomains of the plasma membrane highly enriched in cholesterol and sphingolipids. Lipid rafts tune the spatial and temporal organisation of proteins and lipids on the plasma membrane. They are thought to act as platforms on the membrane where proteins and lipids can be trafficked, compartmentalised and functionally clustered. In the present study we investigated Na(V)1.8 sub-cellular localisation and explored the idea that it is associated with lipid rafts in nociceptors. We found that Na(V)1.8 is distributed in clusters along the axons of DRG neurons in vitro and ex vivo. We also demonstrated, by biochemical and imaging studies, that Na(V)1.8 is associated with lipid rafts along the sciatic nerve ex vivo and in DRG neurons in vitro. Moreover, treatments with methyl-beta-cyclodextrin (M beta CD) and 7-ketocholesterol (7KC) led to the dissociation between rafts and Na(V)1.8. By calcium imaging we demonstrated that the lack of association between rafts and Na(V)1.8 correlated with impaired neuronal excitability, highlighted by a reduction in the number of neurons able to conduct mechanically- and chemically-evoked depolarisations. These findings reveal the sub-cellular localisation of Na(V)1.8 in nociceptors and highlight the importance of the association between Na(V)1.8 and lipid rafts in the control of nociceptor excitability."
"Objectives: To compare the maximum change in numeric rating scale (NRS) pain scores, in patients receiving low-dose ketamine (LDK) or morphine (MOR) for acute pain in the emergency department. Methods: We performed an institutional review board-approved, randomized, prospective, double-blinded trial at a tertiary, level 1 trauma center. A convenience sample of patients aged 18 to 59 years with acute abdominal, flank, low back, or extremity pain were enrolled. Subjects were consented and randomized to intravenous LDK (0.3 mg/kg) or intravenous MOR (0.1 mg/kg). Our primary outcome was the maximum change in NRS scores. A sample size of 20 subjects per group was calculated based on an 80% power to detect a 2-point change in NRS scores between treatment groups with estimated SDs of 2 and an alpha of .05, using a repeated-measures linear model. Results: Forty-five subjects were enrolled (MOR 21, LDK 24). Demographic variables and baseline NRS scores (7.1 vs 7.1) were similar. Ketamine was not superior to MOR in the maximum change of NRS pain scores, MOR = 5 (confidence interval, 6.6-3.5) and LDK = 4.9 (confidence interval, 5.8-4). The time to achieve maximum reduction in NRS pain scores was at 5 minutes for LDK and 100 minutes for MOR. Vital signs, adverse events, provider, and nurse satisfaction scores were similar between groups. Conclusion: Low-dose ketamine did not produce a greater reduction in NRS pain scores compared with MOR for acute pain in the emergency department. However, LDK induced a significant analgesic effect within 5 minutes and provided a moderate reduction in pain for 2 hours. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved."
"Purpose: To characterize refractive errors in Paraguayan children aged 5-16 years and investigate effect of age, gender, and ethnicity. Methods: The study was conducted at 3 schools that catered to Mennonite, indigenous, and mixed race children. Children were examined for presenting visual acuity, autorefraction with and without cycloplegia, and retinoscopy. Data were analyzed for myopia and hyperopia (SE <= -1 D or -0.5 D and >= 2 D or >= 3 D) and astigmatism (cylinder >= 1 D). Spherical equivalent (SE) values were calculated from right eye cycloplegic autorefraction data and analyzed using general linear modelling. Results: There were 190, 118, and 168 children of Mennonite, indigenous and mixed race ethnicity, respectively. SE values between right/left eyes were nonsignificant. Mean visual acuity (VA) without correction was better for Mennonites compared to indigenous or mixed race children (right eyes: 0.031, 0.090, and 0.102 logMAR units, respectively; P<0.000001). There were 2 cases of myopia in the Mennonite group (1.2%) and 2 cases in the mixed race group (1.4%) (SE < -0.5 D). The prevalence of hyperopia (SE >= 2 D) was 40.6%, 34.2%, and 46.3% for Mennonite, indigenous and mixed race children. Corresponding astigmatism rates were 3.2%, 9.5%, and 12.7%. Females were slightly more hyperopic than males, and the 9-11 years age group was the most hyperopic. Mennonite and mixed race children were more hyperopic than indigenous children. Conclusions: Paraguayan children were remarkably hyperopic and relatively free of myopia. Differences with regard to gender, age, and ethnicity were small."
"Ab initio molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of the solvation of LiI3 in four different solvents (water, methanol, ethanol, and acetonitrile) are employed to investigate the molecular and electronic structure of the I-3(-) ion in relation to X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). Simulations show that hydrogen-bond rearrangement in the solvation shell is coupled to intramolecular bond-length asymmetry in the I-3(-) ion. By a combination of charge analysis and I 4d core-level XPS measurements, the mechanism of the solvent-induced distortions has been studied, and it has been concluded that charge localization mediates intermolecular interactions and intramolecular distortion. The approach involving a synergistic combination of theory and experiment probes the solvent-dependent structure of the I-3(-) ion, and the geometric structure has been correlated with the electronic structure."
"Carotenoid content in durian (Durio zibethinus) fruit is an important aspect of fruit quality. We analyzed fruit size, color, carotenoid composition and expression of genes involved in carotenogenesis of two durian cultivars 'Chanee' and `Monthong' with differences in pigmentation during growth and ripening. The ripe fruit of 'Monthong' has a greater diameter and fruit weight than that of 'Chanee', while total carotenoid concentration was approximately 6-fold higher in 'Chanee' than in 'Monthong'. The major carotenoids in the fruit pulp were beta-carotene and alpha-carotene, with minor carotenoids being lutein and zeaxanthin. Significant differences in a-carotene and beta-carotene levels were seen between the two cultivars. We cloned fragments of PSY, PDS, ZDS, CRTTSO, LCYB, LCYE, CYCB, BCH, ECH and Or genes from durian. Expression analysis of the carotenoid biosynthetic genes using qPCR showed that ZDS expression positively correlated with increases in total carotenoids, beta-carotene, alpha-carotene, and lutein content and LCYE expression correlated with total carotenoids and beta-carotene content. In contrast, LCYB showed a negative correlation with total carotenoids, beta-carotene, alpha-carotene and lutein. It can be concluded that carotenoid accumulation during durian fruit growth is regulated by the balanced expression of the ZDS, LCYE and LCYB genes. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."
"In present study, kinetics and reaction mechanism of diazomethane and sumanene in gas phase were studied using quantum calculations at B3LYP/6-311+G(d,p) level of theory. Functionalization of the sumanene by this reaction was investigated in proposed fourteen pathways for different kinds of C-C bond. Vibrational frequencies analysis and intrinsic reaction coordinate (IRC) calculations were carried out and the rate constants for all paths were calculated by using canonical transition state theory (CTST). The best and the worst paths and dominant products for this reaction were determined. Stability of the intermediates, transition sates and products was discussed. Results showed that in the first step of CH2N2 addition to sumanene and formation of corresponding transition state, hub position has the least and rim position has the most barrier energy. Also, for all types of C-C bond, sumanene with a-CH2-group as a bridge was formed and conversion of a sumanene hexagon to heptagon happened for all positions except spoke. Generally, diazomethane can add a -CH2- group in the carbon chain, insert -CH2- group as a bridge or add a -CH3 group to the structure. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."
"Several mosquito-transmitted viruses are causative agents for zoonotic encephalomyelitis. Rapid identification of these viruses in mosquito populations is an effective method for surveying these diseases. To detect multiple mosquito-transmitted viral agents, including West Nile virus, Saint Louis encephalitis virus, Venezuelan equine encephalomyelitis virus, Western equine encephalomyelitis virus, Eastern equine encephalomyelitis virus, Highlands J virus and Japanese encephalitis virus, an assay using multiplex reverse-transcription PCR combined with microfluidic electrophoresis was developed and evaluated. Tailed nested primers were used in the assay to amplify specific viral genomic segments, and products with specific length were further analyzed by using a microfluidic electrophoresis chip. The assay exhibited good specificity and analytical sensitivity (10(2) copies/mu L). This technology can be helpful in the quarantine and surveillance of exotic encephalomyelitis viruses which are transmitted by mosquitoes. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."
"A general theoretical investigation on the reaction of primary amine with aldehyde was carried out by density functional theory. The calculation systems involve three kinds of primary amines (methylamine, vinylamine, and phenylamine) and three kinds of aldehydes (formaldehyde, acetaldehyde, and acrylaldehyde). The steric and electronic inductive effects on the reaction mechanism were studied. Results reveal that the nucleophilic attack of primary amine on aldehyde under neutral conditions leads to carbinolamines, rather than Schiff bases. The nucleophilic attack on the protonated aldehyde produces the protonated Schiff base. The steric hindrance of the aldehyde slows down the nucleophilic attack but allows enough time to abstract a H; consequently, the formation of the protonated Schiff base is preferred. During the carbinolamine protonation, the H+ preferably locates on the amine nitrogen and then is abstracted by the hydroxyl oxygen over an energy barrier, leaving protonated Schiff base after timely water liberation. The formation of a prereaction potential energy well obviously softens the steric and electronic inductive effects on the active barrier for different reactants."
"Background and aims: The relationship between anti-epileptic usage and oxidative damage has not yet been clearly understood. In our study, we investigated oxidative stress parameters, carnitine levels, liver function tests (LFT) and their relationship in epileptic children treated with valproic acid or levetiracetam. Method. LFTs, serum free carnitine and oxidative damage markers and their relations with each other were determined in patients who are on valproic acid or levetiracetam treatment at least for 6 months. 25 patients on therapeutic doses of valproic acid, 26 patients on therapeutic doses of levetiracetam and 26 healthy volunteers as controls were included. LFTs, ammonia, carnitine, lipid peroxidation biomarker malondialdehyde (MDA) and a sensitive marker of DNA damage, 8-hydroxy-2-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) levels were measured. Results of patients are compared to healthy controls. The data is evaluated with IBM SPSS Statistics 22.0. Results: Ammonia and MDA levels were elevated in patients using levetiracetam; 8-OHdG levels were elevated in both patient groups. Carnitine levels were significantly low in patients under valproic acid therapy, however they were not found to be correlated with MDA, 8-OHdG or LFTs. MDA showed positive correlation with ammonia and 8-OHdG in the levetiracetam group. Conclusion: We did not observe hepatotoxicity in patients under therapeutic doses of valproic acid. However, epileptic children under therapeutic doses of levetiracetam showed significantly elevated levels of MDA and 8-OHdG, which is supportive for oxidative damage under levetiracetam therapy. This result was observed for the first time in childhood epilepsies and further studies are needed to understand its mechanism."
"Nonlinearities in arrays of discrete oscillators can cause energy localizations called intrinsic localized modes (ILMs). Two spatial physical manifestations of localization within the array are the ST-mode ILM (a symmetric mode) and the P-mode ILM (an asymmetric mode). The free response and forced response of the asymmetric vibratory P-mode are discussed within this paper, with particular attention given to the linear coupling between the oscillators. The free, undamped response is studied by means of the restricted normal mode approach, which gives the amplitude profile of the P-mode ILM. The initial P-mode ILM amplitude profile, as calculated from the restricted normal mode approach, is capable of creating both forced and unforced persistent ILMs. For the unforced and undamped free response, the P-mode ILM is stable with and without linear coupling, and its response frequency is incommensurate with the response of the surrounding oscillators. It was found that the frequency of oscillation of this mode has a strong relationship to the amplitude of vibration. Moreover, the amplitude profiles generated by the restricted normal mode approach are used to generate initial conditions for the forced, damped case. The existence of the damped and forced P-mode ILM is strongly dependent upon the linear coupling term. It is shown that if linear coupling does not exist, then this mode is persistent but chaotic. To the author's knowledge, this is the first pinned and persistent chaotic ILM to be observed, which is not predicted from local analysis."
"Enantioselective iridium-catalyzed allylic substitutions were used to prepare N-allyl hydroxamic acid derivatives that were suitable for ring-closing metathesis, giving N-methoxylactams. Reactions of these derivatives with Grignard or organolithium compounds gave hemiaminals, which could be reduced diastereoselectively via acyliminium intermediates to give cis-piperidines or cis-pyrrolidines with substituents in the 2,6- or 2,5-positions, respectively. In addition, compounds with a quaternary carbon center could be synthesized by corresponding reactions with potassium cyanide/AcOH. The procedures were applied in the syntheses of alkaloids (-)-209D and (+)-prosophylline."
"Background: The peroneus longus tendon has been used as a graft in orthopaedic reconstruction surgery because of its comparable biomechanical strength with the native anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) and hamstring tendon. However, one of the considerations in choosing an autograft is donor site morbidity. Purpose/Hypothesis: This study aimed to compare ankle eversion and first ray plantarflexion strength between the donor site and its contralateral site after ACL reconstruction. The study hypothesis was that strength measurements will be different between the harvest site and contralateral healthy site. Study Design: Case series; Level of evidence, 4. Methods: Patients who underwent ACL reconstruction using a peroneus longus tendon autograft between March 2017 and December 2018 were included in this study. Patients followed a rehabilitation protocol from the first day after surgery. Ankle eversion and first ray plantarflexion strength were measured using a modified dynamometer 6 months after surgery. Donor site morbidity was assessed 6 months after surgery using the Foot & Ankle Disability Index (FADI) and American Orthopaedic Foot & Ankle Society (AOFAS) scoring system for the ankle and hindfoot. Results: A total of 31 patients (22 male, 9 female; mean age, 27.58 +/- 8.69 years [range, 18.00-45.00 years]) fulfilled the inclusion criteria. There was no significant difference in ankle eversion strength at the donor site compared with the contralateral site (P = .55), with means of 65.87 +/- 7.63 N and 66.96 +/- 8.38 N, respectively. Also, there was no significant difference in ankle first ray plantarflexion strength at the donor site compared with the contralateral site (P = .68), with means of 150.64 +/- 11.67 N and 152.10 +/- 12.16 N, respectively. The mean FADI score of 99.71 +/- 0.57 and mean AOFAS score of 98.71 +/- 3.03 at the donor site were considered excellent results. Conclusion: Ankle eversion and first ray plantarflexion strength at the donor site were similar to those at the contralateral healthy site, with no donor site morbidity. This suggests that the peroneus longus tendon is a promising graft in ACL reconstruction."
"For 7 years, development of submerged vegetation was monitored after fish stock removal during the final phase of a restoration program in the shallow, 2.1 km(2) Lake Loenderveen (The Netherlands). The lake shifted from a turbid, phytoplankton-dominated state, to a clear, macrophyte-dominated state. Vegetation development was very dynamic during years 1-5. Dominance of Elodea nuttallii (Planchon) St. John and Najas marina L. alternated in the initial few years and separate development of Chara species was recorded locally. Elodea nuttallii achieved the highest coverage in the 5th year, but part of the vegetation collapsed in the 6th year. In year 7, the system had recovered and became more stable. The dynamic developments, and spatial differences, are possibly explained by waterfowl interactions, soil nutrient status, and differences in growth form strategies of the species. It was concluded that the trophic level of the lake water was low enough for lake vegetation to recover following removal of most of the fish stock, but stability of the clear water state has increased considerably only after 6 years of development."
"A one-pot, two-step reductive amination of araldehydes or acetophenones with anilines using NaBH4 as a cheap hydride source and catalysed by CeCl3 center dot 7H(2)O has been achieved in EtOH at room temperature in good yields."
"Gastric acid measurement is useful in assessing the effectiveness of antisecretory drugs, however, the conventional tests involve invasive nasogastric intubation. Orally administered C-13-labeled calcium carbonate ((CaCO3)-C-13) reacts with gastric acid to produce C-13-labeled carbon dioxide ((CO2)-C-13), which is then excreted in the breath. The objective of this study was to evaluate the suitability of (CaCO3)-C-13 breath test for estimating gastric acid secretion in human noninvasively. First, the (CaCO3)-C-13 breath test and the measurement of pooled gastric acid under a fasting condition were performed in 6 healthy volunteers to evaluate the correlation between the two parameters. Next, endoscopic gastric acid collection and the (CaCO3)-C-13 breath test were performed on different days after pentagastrin injection in 20 subjects to evaluate the correlation between the tests and the reproducibility. Finally, the same studies were repeated in 4 subjects before and after 1-week rabeprazole, a proton pump inhibitor, administration. The maximum (CO2)-C-13 concentration (Cmax) correlated very well with the amount of pooled gastric acid (r = 0.95), suggesting that (CaCO3)-C-13 breath test values well reflected the fasting intragastric acidity. The (CO2)-C-13 concentration after pentagastrin injection correlated well with pentagastrin-stimulated maximal acid output (r = 0.79 at 20 min). The reproducibility of the (CaCO3)-C-13 breath test under pentagastrin-stimulation was good (coefficient of variation = 0.11). Rabeprazole administration markedly reduced the values of the (CaCO3)-C-13 breath test, suggesting that it can sensitively assess the efficacy of rabeprazole. The (CaCO3)-C-13 breath test can potentially be a useful method for non-invasive estimation for gastric acid secretion in human."
"We propose a new diagrammatic notation system for Goals, Operators, Methods, Selection rules (GOMS), called Codein, with extensions to support the evaluation of Reality Based Interaction Styles. The proposed notation gives added power to GOMS to model and evaluate the task completion time of parallel actions during the performance of a task, something that was previously only possible using CPM-GOMS, which is far more complicated to use. Codein's evaluative power is verified through an experiment. The first condition of the experiment compares the completion time predicted by a GOMSL model, a Codein model, and the actual completion time of participants in a direct manipulation task. The second compares the completion time of participants in a Tangible User Interface task with predictions by a GOMSL model and a Codein model. Predicted task times by Codein in both conditions come close to the actual experimental results."
"Abnormalities in clinical parameters and routine laboratory tests are frequently detected at late stages of many diseases (too late to cure or to prevent life-threatening complications). Hence earlier diagnostic and prognostic markers are needed for decision making and improving therapeutic outcome. In the present issue of Clinical Science, Rudiger and co-workers report findings from a transcriptomic study, which revealed that changes in transcripts involved in amino-sugar metabolism, p53-dependent cell-cycle arrest, beta-adrenergic signalling and intracellular calcium cycling in cardiac tissue of rats with early sepsis could discriminate survivors from non-survivors. These findings underscore the great potential of systems biology in translational medicine. However, further investigations should be done to make the benchside results more feasible for routine clinical practice."
"Here we demonstrate the material's synthetic feasibility for semiconducting alloyed silicon-tin nanocrystals (SiSn-NCs) with quantum confinement effects. An environmentally friendly synthesis is achieved by ns laser ablation of amorphous SiSn in water at ambient conditions. Plasmas generated in the liquid by laser pulses are characterized by spatial confinement with very high pressure (GPa), which allowed the growth of the SiSn-NCs via kinetic pathways. We further illustrate that surface engineering by a direct-current atmospheric pressure microplasma is capable of tailoring the SiSn-NCs surface properties without the need for lengthy surfactants, resulting in room temperature photoluminescence (PL); the PL peak wavelength is red-shifted by more than 250 nm with respect to the PL peak wavelengths observed for comparable elemental silicon nanocrystals."
In this article a brief review of recent progress on preparation and crystal chemistry of rare-earth phosphates have been presented. The article begins with a brief note on the rare-earths and then a description on preparation methods of nano and crystalline samples of binary and complex phosphates. The merits and demerits of the typical procedures are explained in brief. Subsequently the crystal chemistry of various rare-earth phosphates is explained. The diversified crystal chemistry of rare-earth phosphates with compositions as well as with external parameters like pressure and temperature are explained. Typical crystal chemistry of hydrated and anhydrous orthophosphates is also covered. A brief note on phosphates of tetravalent cerium is presented. The high temperature behaviors of complex and metastable phosphates are also discussed. Finally the prospects of rare-earth phosphates for optical and nuclear applications are mentioned in brief.

"Atg4B is a cysteine hydrolase that plays a key role in autophagy. Although it has been proposed as an attractive drug target, inhibitor discovery has proven highly challenging. The absence of a standardized, easily implementable enzyme activity/inhibition assay for Atg4B most likely contributes to this situation. Therefore, three different assay types for Atg4B activity/inhibition quantification were first compared: (1) an approach using fluorogenic Atg4B-substrates, (2) an in-gel densitometric quantification assay and (3) a thermal shift protocol. The gel-based approach showed the most promising results and was validated for screening of potential Atg4B inhibitors. A set of 8 literature inhibitors was included. Remarkably, in our hands only 2 literature references were found to have measurable Atg4B affinity. Furthermore, a fragment library (n = 182) was tested for Atg4B inhibition. One library member showed inhibition at high micromolar concentration and was found fit for further, fragment-based inhibitor design. (C) 2016 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved."
"In terms of tons per day SO3 is one of the most important chemicals in the world. It is produced via the contact process in a gas phase catalytic oxidation reaction. The contact process consists of multiple catalyst beds, inter-stage cooling and an absorption step in the case of sulphuric acid production. Transferring this process to a microstructured reactor with its unique heat and mass transport properties should make it possible to develop a small scale one pass synthesis well suited for on-site SO3 production, e.g., for surfactant making. In a test reactor experiments were performed with different molar ratios of sulphur dioxide to oxygen, hydrodynamic residence time and reaction temperature. Numerical simulations with ANSYS FLUENT 12.0 were performed for a single channel configuration. For this purpose a detailed model of the flow, the heat distribution and the surface chemistry was used. For the surface chemistry a detailed kinetic model based on elementary steps occurring on the catalyst surface was used. The assumed multi-step mechanism involves coordination of SO2 on two surface sites. The simulations are compared to the experimental results. Good agreement between the model predictions and the experimental results is achieved. A sensitivity analysis was performed to get an idea of the rate determining steps. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

"Light scattering is a well-established experimental technique, which gains more and more popularity in the biological field because it offers the means for non-invasive imaging and detection. However, the interpretation of light-scattering signals remains challenging due to the complexity of most biological systems. Here, we investigate static and dynamic scattering properties of red blood cells (RBCs) using two mesoscopic hydrodynamics simulation methods-multi-particle collision dynamics and dissipative particle dynamics. Light scattering is studied for various membrane shear elasticities, bending rigidities, and RBC shapes (e.g., biconcave and stomatocyte). Simulation results from the two simulation methods show good agreement, and demonstrate that the static light scattering of a diffusing RBC is not very sensitive to the changes in membrane properties and moderate alterations in cell shapes. We also compute dynamic light scattering of a diffusing RBC, from which dynamic properties of RBCs such as diffusion coefficients can be accessed. In contrast to static light scattering, the dynamic measurements can be employed to differentiate between the biconcave and stomatocytic RBC shapes and generally allow the differentiation based on the membrane properties. Our simulation results can be used for better understanding of light scattering by RBCs and the development of new non-invasive methods for blood-flow monitoring."
"Counterilluminating animals produce a ventral light to hide their silhouette in the water column. This midwater camouflage technique requires a fine and dynamic control of the wavelength, angular distribution, and intensity of their luminescence, which needs to continuously match ambient downwelling light. Recently, extraocular opsins have been suggested to play a role in the bioluminescence control of several organisms, such as squids, comb jellies, or brittle stars, providing a way for photogenic structures to perceive their own light output. By analysing a growing embryonic series of the velvet belly lanternshark, Etmopterus spinax, we show that the development of lanternshark luminescence competence is associated with the expression of encephalopsin within epidermal cells and in the light-regulating structure of the photogenic organs. Such an intra-uterine expression of encephalopsin strongly supports this blue-sensitive extraocular opsin to allow bioluminescence perception in lanternshark photophores and suggests a clear physiological interaction between photoemission and photoperception."
Focusing properties of high-numerical-aperture micro-Fresnel zone plates (FZP) have been rigorously investigated at the wavelength from deep ultraviolet to visible based on the combination of the vectorial angular spectrum theory and three-dimensional finite-difference time-domain method. New insights are found. The axial spot size evaluated by full-width-at-half-maximum is in direct proportion to the inverse of the total annulus number. Linearly negative focal shift phenomenon can be observed due to the wavelength dispersion over a finite range of tens of nanometers. A proper wavelength deviation can lead to the maximum focal intensity. A simple method has been demonstrated to probe either mull-focus or a light needle using a composite microstructure based on high-NA FZPs. The findings of this study expand the common understandings of the classic widely-used FZPs.
"The ultrastructural transformation of wood cellulose crystals by hydrothermal treatment was followed by synchrotron and standard X-ray scattering experiments. When treated at 200 degrees C for 2 h in the presence of an excess of water, a significant sharpening of the equatorial reflections of crystalline cellulose was observed, and the average crystallite size, estimated from the X-ray line broadening, was twice as large as that of untreated wood cellulose. During the treatment, the cellulose structure was converted from the native monoclinic form of cellulose I into a pseudo-orthorhombic system, coined as cellulose I', a transformation occurring only with an excess of water, above 180 degrees C and after more than half an hour. In situ experiments indicated that the increase of crystallite size was likely due to cocrystallization of individual crystallites rather than to the crystallization of the amorphous domains of cellulose."
"Background Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the major cause of mortality world wide. Coronary artery disease (CAD) contributes to half of mortalities caused by CVD. The mainstay of management of CAD is medical therapy and revascularisation. Revascularisation can be achieved via coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) or percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). Peripheral arteries, such as the femoral or radial artery, provide the access to the coronary arteries to perform diagnostic or therapeutic (or both) procedures. Objectives To assess the benefits and harms of the transradial compared to the transfemoral approach in people with CAD undergoing diagnostic coronary angiography (CA) or PCI (or both). Search methods We searched the following databases for randomised controlled trials on 10 October 2017: Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, and Web of Science Core Collection. We also searched ClinicalTrials.gov and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform in August 2017. There were no language restrictions. Reference lists were also checked and we contacted authors of included studies for further information. Selection criteria We included randomised controlled trials that compared transradial and transfemoral approaches in adults (18 years of age or older) undergoing diagnostic CA or PCI (or both) for CAD. Data collection and analysis We used the standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. At least two authors independently screened trials, extracted data, and assessed the risk of bias in the included studies. We contacted trial authors for missing information. We used risk ratio (RR) for dichotomous outcomes and mean difference (MD) or standardised mean difference (SMD) for continuous data, with their 95% confidence intervals (CIs). All analyses were checked by another author. Main results We identified 31 studies (44 reports) including 27,071 participants and two ongoing studies. The risk of bias in the studies was low or unclear for several domains. Compared to the transfemoral approach, the transradial approach reduced short-term net adverse clinical events (NACE) (i.e. assessed during hospitalisation and up to 30 days of follow-up) (RR 0.76, 95% CI 0.61 to 0.94; 17,133 participants; 4 studies; moderate quality evidence), cardiac death (RR 0.69, 95% CI 0.54 to 0.88; 11,170 participants; 11 studies; moderate quality evidence). However, short-term myocardial infarction was similar between both groups (RR 0.91, 95% CI 0.81 to 1.02; 19,430 participants; 11 studies; high quality evidence). The transradial approach had a lower procedural success rate (RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.96 to 0.98; 25,920 participants; 28 studies; moderate quality evidence), but was associated with a lower risk of all-cause mortality (RR 0.77, 95% CI 0.62 to 0.95; 18,955 participants; 10 studies; high quality evidence), bleeding (RR 0.54, 95% CI 0.40 to 0.74; 23,043 participants; 20 studies; low quality evidence), and access site complications (RR 0.36, 95% CI 0.22 to 0.59; 16,112 participants; 24 studies; low quality evidence). Authors' conclusions Transradial approach for diagnostic CA or PCI (or both) in CAD may reduce short-term NACE, cardiac death, all-cause mortality, bleeding, and access site complications. There is insufficient evidence regarding the long-term clinical outcomes (i.e. beyond 30 days of follow-up)."
"In this article, a new mode of droplets manipulation is presented and applied for simultaneous multiplexed DNA detection. We call this droplets manipulation, ""assembly-line manipulation of droplets (ALMD)"". Firstly, multiple droplets containing the same target mixtures are generated in the microchannel, and then fused with later generated different droplets containing corresponding probes, respectively. Finally, all the fused droplets were fluorescence imaged on-line and real-time. The successful implementation of droplets fluorescence encoding based on ALMD shows the reproducibility and accuracy of this manipulation mode. As a proof-of-concept application, the simultaneous multiplexed DNA detection was carried out through the model of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) gene sequence and variola virus (small pox, VV) gene sequence based on ALMD in the microfluidic system. It is proved that this method achieves simultaneous multiplexed DNA measurements with a significantly time-saving way and without different dye-labelled probes or complex operation procedures. In addition, it reveals the possibility of high-throughput biosensing with simple chip design and detection equipment. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."
"The group refractive index is important in length calibration of Fourier domain interferometers by transparent transfer standards. We demonstrate accurate group refractive index quantification using a Fourier domain short coherence Sagnac interferometer. Because of a justified linear length calibration function, the calibration constants cancel out in the evaluation of the group refractive index, which is then obtained accurately from two uncalibrated lengths. Measurements of two standard thickness coverslips revealed group indices of 1.5426 +/- 0.0042 and 1.5434 +/- 0.0046, with accuracies quoted at the 95% confidence level. This agreed with the dispersion data of the coverslip manufacturer and therefore validates our method. Our method provides a sample specific and accurate group refractive index quantification using the same Fourier domain interferometer that is to be calibrated for the length. This reduces significantly the requirements of the calibration transfer standard. (C) 2018 Optical Society of America"
"The aim of this study was to develop an analytical procedure based on liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) for analysis of monomeric organic N compounds in soil extracts. To benchmark the developed LC-MS method it was compared with a capillary electrophoresis-mass spectrometry (CE-MS) method recently used for analysis of small organic N monomers in soil. The separation was optimized and analytical performance assessed with 69 purified standards, then the LC-MS method was used to analyse soil extracts. Sixty-two out of 69 standards were analysable by LC-MS with separation on a hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography column. The seven compounds that could not be analysed were strongly cationic polyamines. Limits of detection for a 5 mu L injection ranged between 0.002 and 0.38 mu mol L-1, with the majority (49 out of 62) having limits of detection better than 0.05 mu mol L-1 The overall profile and concentration of small organic N monomers in soil extracts was broadly similar between LC-MS and CE-MS, with the notable exception of four ureides that were detected by LC-MS only. In soil extracts that had been concentrated ten-fold the detection and quantification of (some) organic N compounds was compromised by the presence of large amounts of inorganic salts. The developed LC-MS method offered advantages and disadvantages relative to CE-MS, and a combination of the two methods would achieve the broadest possible coverage of organic N in soil extracts.

"Adiposity and adipokines are implicated in the loss of skeletal muscle mass with age and in several chronic disease states. The aim of this study was to determine the effects of human obese and lean subcutaneous adipose tissue secretome on myogenesis and metabolism in skeletal muscle cells derived from both young (18-30 yr) and elderly (>65 yr) individuals. Obese subcutaneous adipose tissue secretome impaired the myogenesis of old myoblasts but not young myoblasts. Resistin was prolifically secreted by obese subcutaneous adipose tissue and impaired myotube thickness and nuclear fusion by activation of the classical NFKB pathway. Depletion of resistin from obese adipose tissue secretome restored myogenesis. Inhibition of the classical NFKB pathway protected myoblasts from the detrimental effect of resistin on myogenesis. Resistin also promoted intramyocellular lipid accumulation in myotubes and altered myotube metabolism by enhancing fatty acid oxidation and increasing myotube respiration and ATP production. In conclusion, resistin derived from human obese subcutaneous adipose tissue impairs myogenesis of human skeletal muscle, particularly older muscle, and alters muscle metabolism in developing myotubes. These findings may have important implications for the maintenance of muscle mass in older people with chronic inflammatory conditions, or older people who are obese or overweight."
"We establish the relation between two language recognition models that use counters and operate in real-time: Greibach's partially blind machines operating in real time (RT-PBLIND), which recognize Petri Net languages, and the consensually regular (CREG) language model of the authors. The latter is based on synchronized computational threads of a finite automaton, where at each step one thread acts as the leader and all other threads as followers. We introduce two new normal forms of RT-PBLIND machines (and Petri Nets), such that counter operations are scheduled and rarefied, and transitions are quasi-deterministic, i.e., the finite automaton obtained by eliminating counter moves is deterministic. We prove that the CREG family can simulate any normalized RT-PBLIND machine, but it also contains the non-RT-PBLIND language {a(n)b(n) n > 1}*. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."
"Purpose of review We review the current available evidence on the metabolic fate of human milk proteins and their potential clinical implications for growth and body composition development vs. those of formula proteins in preterm infants. Recent findings The decreased content of human milk protein in preterm mothers throughout lactation might contribute to the reduced growth reported in exclusively human milk-fed infants compared with that of formula-fed infants. Recent studies have demonstrated that preterm infants are capable of degrading human milk proteins regardless of their degree of prematurity or postnatal age, with limited contribution from milk proteases to protein digestion. The nitrogen balance of fortified human milk-fed preterm infants is higher than that of formula-fed preterm infants. Moreover, the growth of human milk-fed preterm infants appears to be accompanied by fat-free mass deposition. Summary Provided that adequate protein and energy intakes are delivered, human milk enhances protein use rather than oxidation as well as promotes tissue growth, leading to preferential fat-free mass deposition and contributing to the recovery of the body composition in preterm infants. Human milk feeding should be supported and promoted for all preterm mother-infant pairs."
"Anomalous small-angle X-ray scattering (ASAXS) is a technique developed in the 1980s giving access to chemical information of nano-objects besides characteristic features like size and volume fraction given by classical SAXS. ASAXS is an element-selective technique based on the anomalous variation of the scattering factor near the absorption edge of one chosen element. A simple approach is proposed to extract chemical information from anomalous SAXS data. To illustrate the procedure, data treatment is applied to discriminate between different possible phases that may form nano-oxides in oxide-dispersion-strengthened (ODS) steels.

"Perivascular adipose tissue (PVAT), surrounding arteries is metabolically active. Obesity and antiretroviral therapy (ART) may cause pathophysiological conditions in the aortic wall and surrounding PVAT. The aim of the study was to determine the histological effects on the aortic wall, aortic PVAT adipocyte morphology and leptin staining intensity in obese rats treated with ART. Wistar rats (N = 36) were divided into four groups; a lean control (C/ART-), ART control (C/ART+), high-calorie diet (HCD) untreated (HCD/ART-) and HCD and ART experimental (HCD/ART+). The aorta and surrounding PVAT were stained with haematoxylin and eosin (H&E) and anti-leptin antibodies for immunohistochemistry (IHC). The C/ART+ group had a thinner tunica media compared to the HCD/ART- group. The tunica adventitia was thicker in the ART groups (C/ART+ and HCD/ART+) compared to the lean control group. White adipocytes in the HCD/ART- group was larger in size compared to the other three groups. The high-calorie diet groups (HCD/ART- and HCD/ART+) had increased adipocyte sizes, for both brown and differentiating adipocytes, compared to the control groups (C/ART- and C/ART+). The unilocular and differentiating adipocytes in the C/ART+ group showed intense leptin staining. Unilocular and differentiating adipocytes in the HCD/ART- and HCD/ART+ groups showed weak to no leptin staining intensity. The present study indicated that ART and a HCD, separately and combined, altered both the tunica media and adventitia of the aortic wall, whereas the HCD alone caused adipocytes to increase in size. The leptin staining intensity suggested that ART alone may lead to increased leptin expression, whereas ART combined with a HCD may cause leptin deficiency. Changes seen with ART in a rat model suggest that aortic wall thickness and PVAT adipocyte morphology alterations should be considered by clinicians in obese individuals receiving ART."
"Analyzing, visualizing and communicating uncertainties are important issues as geological models can never be fully determined. To date, there exists no general approach to quantify uncertainties in geological modeling. We propose here to use information entropy as an objective measure to compare and evaluate model and observational results. Information entropy was introduced in the 50s and defines a scalar value at every location in the model for predictability. We show that this method not only provides a quantitative insight into model uncertainties but, due to the underlying concept of information entropy, can be related to questions of data integration (i.e. how is the model quality interconnected with the used input data) and model evolution (i.e. does new data - or a changed geological hypothesis - optimize the model). In other words information entropy is a powerful measure to be used for data assimilation and inversion. As a first test of feasibility, we present the application of the new method to the visualization of uncertainties in geological models, here understood as structural representations of the subsurface. Applying the concept of information entropy on a suite of simulated models, we can clearly identify (a) uncertain regions within the model, even for complex geometries; (b) the overall uncertainty of a geological unit, which is, for example, of great relevance in any type of resource estimation; (c) a mean entropy for the whole model, important to track model changes with one overall measure. These results cannot easily be obtained with existing standard methods. The results suggest that information entropy is a powerful method to visualize uncertainties in geological models, and to classify the indefiniteness of single units and the mean entropy of a model quantitatively. Due to the relationship of this measure to the missing information, we expect the method to have a great potential in many types of geoscientific data assimilation problems - beyond pure visualization.

"Caprifig has a particular interest in plant conservation due to their important role in fig pollination. In this work, 53 morphological traits and four pollen descriptors were studied in order to select the most discriminating traits. Significant difference among ecotypes was revealed for almost quantitative traits except for anther number/flower and pollen viability. Qualitative data showed morphological variation within ecotypes (Blastophaga richness, external color, internal color, leaf color, central shape lobe, number lobe, tree growth habit, density branch, aspect branch and size tree). The results of the principal component analyses (PCA) for the morphological traits and pollen descriptors indicated that the first three PCs explained 54.23% of the total variation. Unweighted pair group method with arithmetic mean (UPGMA) cluster analysis based on the similarity matrix grouped studied ecotypes in five clusters. It was possible to discriminate seven distinct ecotypes (Magouli1, Magouli2, Dhokkar1, Dholdcar4, Bouharrag1, Bouharrag2, and Bithri1). Similarly, some ecotypes sharing some fruit and shoots traits (Dhokkar2 and Dhokkar3) or some leaves and shoots characteristics (Bouharrag1, Assafri and Jrani) were grouped together. Some homonyms were detected between ecotypes such as Magouli, Bithri, Bouharrag and Dhokkar. Our study suggests among the 53 morphological traits and the four pollen descriptors 40 characters showed a good discriminating power and can be used for the discrimination of Tunisian caprifig trees.

"Endometriosis is a prevalent gynecological disorder that eventually gives rise to painful invasive lesions. Increased levels of transforming growth factor-beta 1 (TGF-B1) have been reported in endometriosis. However, details of the effects of high TGF-B1 on downstream signaling in ectopic endometrial tissue remain obscure. We induced endometriotic lesions in mice by surgical auto-transplantation of endometrial tissues to the peritoneal regions. We then treated endometriotic (ectopic and eutopic endometrial tissues) and nonendometriotic (only eutopic endometrial tissues) animal groups with either active TGF-B1 or PBS. Our results demonstrate that externally supplemented TGF-B1 increases the growth of ectopically implanted endometrial tissues in mice, possibly via SMAD2/3 activation and PTEN suppression. Adhesion molecules integrins (beta3 and beta8) and FAK were upregulated in the ectopic endometrial tissue when TGF-B1 was administered. Phosphorylated E-cadherin, N-cadherin, and vimentin were enhanced in the ectopic endometrial tissue in the presence of TGF-B1 in the mouse model, and correlated with epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in ovarian endometriotic cells of human origin. Furthermore, in response to TGF-B1, the expression of RHOGTPases (RAC1, RHOC, and RHOG) was increased in the human endometriotic cells (ovarian cyst derived cells from endometriosis patient) and tissues from the mouse model of endometriosis (ectopic endometrial tissue). TGF-B1 enhanced the migratory, invasive, and colonizing potential of human endometriotic cells. Therefore, we conclude that TGF-B1 potentiates the adhesion of ectopic endometrial cells/tissues in the peritoneal region by enhancing the integrin and FAK signaling axis, and also migration via cadherin-mediated EMT and RHOGTPase signaling cascades. TGF-B1 regulates the pathophysiology of endometriosis by specifically enhancing the migration, attachment, proliferation, colonization, and invasiveness of floating endometriotic cells or tissues, via the integrin-FAK, cadherin, and RHOGTPase signaling cascades."
"The design, realization and characterization of dual-stage X-band high-power and highly-efficient monolithic microwave integrated circuit (MMIC) power amplifiers (PAs) with AlGaN/GaN high electronic mobility transistors (HEMTs) is presented. These high power amplifiers (HPAs) are based on a precise investigation of circuit-relevant HEMT behavior using two different field-plate variants and its effects on PA performance as well as optimization of HPA driver stage size which also has a deep impact on the entire HPA. Two broadband (3 GHz) MMICs with different field-plate variants and two narrowband (1 GHz) PAs with different driver- to final-stage gate-width ratio are realized with a maximum output power of 19-23 W, a maximum power-added efficiency (PAE) of a parts per thousand yen40%, and an associated power gain of 17 dB at X-band. Furthermore, two 1 mm test transistors of the same technology with the mentioned field-plate variants and a 1 mm test MMIC support VSWR-ratio tests of 6:1 and 4:1, respectively."
"Objective: To investigate whether radial artery pressure is a reliable surrogate measure of central arterial pressure as approximated by femoral artery pressure in minimally invasive cardiac surgery with retrograde perfusion via femoral cannulation. Method: Fifty-two consecutive patients undergoing minimally invasive cardiac surgery were prospectively included in this study. Cardiopulmonary bypass was established via a femoral artery cannulation and femoral vein. Radial and femoral arterial pressures were recorded continuously, and the pressure differential between them was calculated for both systolic and mean arterial pressures. The agreement between measurements from the two arteries was compared using Bland-Altman plots. An interval of 95% limits of agreement of less than 20 mm Hg was set as satisfactory agreement. Results: Average age was 65 +/- 14 years. With respect to systolic arterial pressure, 28 patients (54%) had a peak pressure differential between radial and femoral arteries >= 20mm Hg. With respect to mean arterial pressure, only five patients (9%) had a peak pressure differential >= 20 mm Hg. The pressure differential changed with time. Pressure differential in systolic arterial pressure was 5 +/- 8 nnnn Hg until aortic declamping, then increased to a peak of 23 +/- 16 nnnn Hg when cardiopulmonary bypass was turned off. The femoral systolic arterial pressures were significantly greater than radial systolic arterial pressures from time of aortic declamping to 20 min after cardiopulmonary bypass. The Bland-Altman plots revealed large biases and poor agreement in this period. Conclusion: Radial and femoral systolic artery pressure readings can differ significantly in minimally invasive cardiac surgery with retrograde perfusion. Intraoperative arterial pressure management based solely on radial systolic arterial pressure readings should be avoided."

"BackgroundAfter achalasia treatment, a subset of patients has poor esophageal emptying without having symptoms. There is no consensus on whether to pre-emptively treat these patients. We hypothesized that, if left untreated, these patients will experience earlier symptom recurrence than patients without stasis. Methods99 treated achalasia patients who were in clinical remission (Eckardt 3) at 3months after treatment were divided into two groups, based on presence or absence of esophageal stasis on a timed barium esophagogram performed after 3months. Key ResultsTwo years after initial treatment, patients with stasis after treatment still had a wider esophagus (3cm; IQR: 2.2-3.8) and more stasis (3.5cm; IQR: 1.9-5.6) than patients without stasis (1.8cm wide and 0cm stasis; both P<.001). In patients with stasis, the esophageal diameter had increased from 2.5 to 3.0cm within 2years of follow-up. The symptoms, need for and time to retreatment were comparable between the two groups. Quality of life and reflux symptoms were also comparable between the two groups. Conclusions & InferencesAlthough patients with stasis initially had a wider esophagus and 2years after treatment also had a higher degree of stasis and a more dilated esophagus, compared to patients without stasis, they did not have a higher chance of requiring retreatment. We conclude that stasis in symptom-free achalasia patients after treatment does not predict treatment failure within 2years and can therefore not serve as a sole reason for retreatment."
"There is evidence that many individuals are on higher doses of antipsychotic drugthan is required for optimal functioning yet there are limited guidelines on how to reduce them. This paper reports on 5year outcomes for sixty-seven individuals who received treatment at a community mental health center and were offered the opportunity to gradually reduce their doses of antipsychotic drug in collaboration with the treating psychiatrist. Over a period of 6months, the author invited patients who were clinically stable and able to participate in discussions of potential risks and benefits to begin gradual dose reductions. Initially, 40 expressed interest in tapering and 27 declined. The groups did not differ in age, sex, race, or diagnosis. The group who chose to taper began on significantly lower doses. Most patients succeeded at making modest dose reductions. At 5years, there were no significant differences in the two outcomes measures, rate of hospitalization and employment status. Many patients were able to engage in these discussions which did not result in widespread discontinuation of drug. This is a naturalistic, small study of a topic that warrants further research."
"Methods: A continuously updated population-based RA register was established in the city of Malmo, southern Sweden, in 1997. Self-completed postal questionnaires issued in 1997, 2002, and 2005 were used to collect information on demographics, medication, and health status. Cross-sectional comparisons were made between data from 1997, 2002, and 2005. Results: Between 1997 and 2005, the proportion of patients treated with any disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drug (DMARD) including biologics increased substantially (from 52% to 87%), as well as the proportion treated with methotrexate (from 23% to 52%) and biologics (almost exclusively tumour necrosis factor inhibitors) (from 0% to 20%). Twelve per cent of RA patients received biologics 5 years from disease onset in 2005. In parallel with changes in treatment, mean Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ) scores (1.19 vs. 0.89) and all Short Form 36 (SF-36) subscales improved from 1997 to 2005 (non-overlapping confidence intervals). Conclusion: Between 1997 and 2005, there was a substantial increase in the use of DMARDs, which was accompanied by improved mean HAQ and SF-36 scores in cross-sectional comparisons. These results support the concept that more intensive treatment with DMARDs and biologics can have profound effects on the overall health status in RA patients at the population level."
"A finite element formulation is developed to predict the lateral torsional buckling resistance of plane frames with moment connections. The solution focuses on the simple characterization the elastic warping behavior of moment connections in a manner that allows them to interface seamlessly with existing beam buckling finite elements, thus providing means for realistically modelling the lateral torsional buckling of plane frames. Special attention is devoted to the joint rotation effects. The technique successfully captures the interaction between beams and columns of frames, an effect that is neglected in present design methodologies based on individual member checks. The solution is shown to provide lateral torsional buckling resistance predictions in very good agreement with shell based finite element solutions at a fraction of the modelling and computational effort. For typical frames that are laterally supported at the joints, the study suggests that present design methodologies that isolate the member from the rest of the structure provide conservative buckling resistance predictions. Conversely, for frames with no lateral restraints at some of the joints, the present solution predicts lateral torsional buckling resistances that are significantly different from those based on design standard equations, suggesting the need to account for interaction effects in such situations."
"A new third-order WENO scheme is proposed to achieve the desired order of convergence at the critical points for scalar hyperbolic equations. A new reference smoothness indicator is introduced, which satisfies the sufficient condition on the weights for the third-order convergence. Following the truncation error analysis, we have shown that the proposed scheme achieves the desired order accurate for smooth solutions with arbitrary number of vanishing derivatives if the parameter epsilon satisfies certain conditions. We have made a comparative study of the proposed scheme with the existing schemes such as WENO-JS, WENO-Z, and WENO-N3 through different numerical examples. The result shows that the proposed scheme (WENO-MN3) achieves better performance than these schemes."
"Salmonella spp. is acknowledged as a significant zoonotic foodborne pathogen throughout the world. Contaminated pork consumption is considered as a main cause of human salmonellosis. In the later stage of the pig, production chain, poor hygiene and unsuitable storage conditions in retail outlets are considered to be key factors linked to the risk of Salmonella infection. The purpose of current study, which was conducted throughout April 2014 to September 2014, was to determine the prevalence and characteristics of Salmonella spp. in pork sold at the retail stage in wet markets and supermarkets in the Chiang Mai urban area of Thailand. Additionally, clonal relations between Salmonella strains described in this study and those identified in earlier study from the same geographical area were considered. It is provided as a means of contributing to current knowledge regarding Salmonella epidemiology with an ultimate aim of improved food security and consumer protection in this region. From a total of 82 pork samples analyzed in this study, 41% were positive for Salmonella, with prevalence of 73.2% from wet markets (n = 30/41) and 9.8% from supermarkets (n = 4/41). Twelve Salmonella serovars were identified, S. Rissen being the most commonly encountered. Antibiotic resistance of the isolates was highest for ampicillin and tetracycline (53%), followed by streptomycin (44%). Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) and subsequent geographical distribution analysis indicated that the clonal Salmonella strains originated from multiple sources had been spread over a wide area. The existence of a common pig supply chain ""farm-slaughterhouse-retail"" transmission route is inferred. Continuous monitoring of Salmonella along the entire production chain is needed to reduce contamination loads and to ensure the safety of pork products for end consumers. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

"Lofts are housing forms converted from warehouse-workshop into a ""habitable environment"" in coastal towns of Europe and the USA after the Industrial Revolution. Particularly positioned in coastal towns of New York, Loft life made an impact in the world Over time. It became a new form of living when artists converted structures like factories into habitable environment. From past to today, all national and international developments during the process affected and accelerated development of the constant evolution of housing concept. In that sense, in this study, the meaning of Lofts in Istanbul and the effect and change of socio-cultural stratification on spatial conversion of housing consumerism has been examined in the context of Istanbul. Especially, process of gentrification, shaped by effects of urban transformation post 1980, and cultural development affected by this process, attendant Loft life has become an accelerating way of life. In this context, historical and stylistic value and especially usage of Loft living has been examined. In the first chapter; past, present and the post-7980 development of housing sector in Istanbul, in the second chapter, with a thriving cultural life, and Loft formation, has been examined in the context of structural criteria, resulting three different Lofts have been discussed in detail. In the third section, three different types of Loft have been analyzed in the context of space depending on examples. As a result of researches, three different types of Lofts, ""Original"", ""Semi"" and ""Imitation"" concepts have become clear and it has been concluded that ""Imitation Loft"" formation gives direction to life in Istanbul."
"Free Trade Agreements (FTAs) are increasingly employed by the European Union (EU) as a tool of its internal market and external relations policy. This article addresses the evolution of FTAs through the jurisprudential lens of the Court of Justice of the EU. To this end, and after clarifying key constitutional issues (competence, substance and hierarchy), it discusses the Court's case-law on the direct effect of certain measures, and addresses a selection of cross-functional questions regarding the interpretation of material law founded in the Court's case-law. As a matter of general tendency, the jurisprudence takes a rather liberal stance in recognising direct effects of FTAs concerning analogical interpretation of economic freedom. By contrast, a more restrictive approach appears to have been applied to the interpretation of provisions having an impact on the possibility of third states' citizens to reside in the EU."
"The dramatically increasing prevalence of elderly persons disabled by conditions associated with aging could motivate reexamination of service delivery and financing for this population, seeking quality, reliability, and efficiency. Research and innovation have established many components of effective reforms, such as patient-directed care planning, encouragement of volunteer networks and family caregiving, mobilizing services to the home, adhering to patient goals and priorities, limiting poly pharmacy, reducing the risk of falls, and providing adequate support services for people with disabilities. However, none have become widespread and rarely, if ever, are all of the evidence-based improvements available to a particular disabled elder. This essay argues that reform for disabled elders should be anchored in geographic communities, with a new organizational entity having responsibility for measuring performance and implementing improvements. This entity would use data and public input to set priorities, test improvement strategies, and take steps to assure adequate workforce and service supply. In this MediCaring Community, sustaining finances could come from local taxes or capturing the savings in Medicare that arise with optimal comprehensive services. Generating a new structure to monitor and manage eldercare services for a geographic community would be readily accomplished in some communities and would be worth testing."
"Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is a global problem. To better understand HCV infection researchers employ in vitro HCV cell-culture (HCVcc) systems that use Huh-7 derived hepatoma cells that are particularly permissive to HCV infection. A variety of hyper-permissive cells have been subcloned for this purpose. In addition, subclones of Huh-7 which have evolved resistance to HCV are available. However, the mechanisms of susceptibility or resistance to infection among these cells have not been fully determined. In order to elucidate mechanisms by which hepatoma cells are susceptible or resistant to HCV infection we performed genome-wide expression analyses of six Huh-7 derived cell cultures that have different levels of permissiveness to infection. A great number of genes, representing a wide spectrum of functions are differentially expressed between cells. To focus our investigation, we identify host proteins from HCV replicase complexes, perform gene expression analysis of three HCV infected cells and conduct a detailed analysis of differentially expressed host factors by integrating a variety of data sources. Our results demonstrate that changes relating to susceptibility to HCV infection in hepatoma cells are linked to the innate immune response, secreted signal peptides and host factors that have a role in virus entry and replication. This work identifies both known and novel host factors that may influence HCV infection. Our findings build upon current knowledge of the complex interplay between HCV and the host cell, which could aid development of new antiviral strategies."
"Spanish Pyrenean reservoirs are under pressure from high sediment yields in their contributing catchments. Sediment fingerprinting approaches offer the potential to quantify the contribution of different sediment sources, evaluate catchment erosion dynamics and develop management plans to tackle, among other problems, reservoir siltation. Within this context, the objective of this study was to assess catchment source contribution changes both over a longitudinal river reach and to a reservoir delta deposit to improve our understanding of sediment supply dynamics. The catchment of the Isabena River (445 km(2)), located in the central Spanish Pyrenees, is an agroforest catchment supplying sediments, together with the A parts per thousand sera River, to the Barasona reservoir at an annual rate of 350 t km(2) with implications for reservoir longevity. The ability to discriminate between agricultural, forest, subsoil and scrubland sources based on geochemical, radionuclide and magnetic susceptibility fingerprint properties analysed in the < 63-mu m sediment fraction was investigated by conducting statistical tests to select an optimum composite fingerprint. The contributions of sediment sources for channel bed and delta sediments were assessed by applying a new data processing methodology which was written in the C programming language and designed to test the entire parameter space, providing a detailed description of the optimal solution by a Monte Carlo method. The solution for each sample was characterised by the mean value of the user-defined solutions (n = 100) and the lower goodness of fit value was applied. The solutions from the mixing model had goodness of fit values > 82 %. The channel bed sediments in the upper reach were dominated by subsoil sources (> 80 %), and the lower reaches had a higher proportion of sediment coming from the agricultural source (> 55 %). Contributions for delta sediments were dominated by agricultural, forest and subsoil sources but in varying proportions within the deposit. The switch in the sources of sediment between the headwaters and the catchment outlet was due to differences in the distribution of the land uses/land covers in the contributing areas. Differences between channel bed sediment and delta sediment source contributions were related to local sediment deposition conditions. The new unmixing approach is able to provide the optimal solution by a robust and integral Monte Carlo method guaranteeing a broader interpretation of the optimal solution including its dispersion in all unmixing cases. The results support the use of sediment fingerprinting approaches in this Spanish Pyrenees mountain catchment, which will enable us to better understand catchment sediment delivery to an important water supply reservoir."
"Despite numerous studies about Marangoni instabilities, there are very few of them conducted for the menisci in microscale channels or tubes. In this paper, the onset of Marangoni flow on an initially isothermal meniscus in a capillary channel is studied. The temperature gradient perpendicular to the meniscus is found arousing a Benard-Marangoni instability when the channel size or the temperature gradient beyond certain values. The threshold Marangoni Number for the instability is obtained, which turns out to be dependent on the Biot Number. The evolution of the meniscus flow patterns with increasing Marangoni Number is studied. The influences of gravity are discussed. The present work it a preliminary step to a comprehensive understanding of Marangoni instability in capillary structures. The temperature gradient that is perpendicular to the meniscus should be paid attention to in the related applications. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."
"This study attempted to determine certain characteristics of the species caught in the boat seine fishery in the Istanbul Strait during the 2009-2010 fishing season, including catch composition, commercial and nontarget catch ratios, catch per unit effort (CPUE), and the length distributions of commercial species. A survey of 20 boat seine operations detected species belonging to the following 3 different taxonomic groups: 26 Osteichthyes, 2 Crustacea, and 1 Mollusca. Of all of the nontarget species, 13 were commercial, 14 were noncommercial, and only 1 was under threat. Of the total catch, the proportion of the commercial species in the nontarget catch was 31.3%, and that of the discarded catch, which the fishermen did not take into account, was 2.8%. According to the Spearman rank correlation test, there was a significant correlation between the total catch and the discarded catch (r = 0.759); the size of discarded catch increased as the catch increased (P = 0.000). It was clear from the data that overfishing was seen in the commercial species."
"The development of versatile functionalization concepts for graphene is currently in the focus of research. Upon oxo-functionalization of graphite, the full surface of graphene becomes accessible for C-C bond formation to introduce out-of-plane functionality. Herein, we present the arylation of graphene with arylazocarboxylic tert-butyl esters, which generates aryl radicals after activation with an acid. Surprisingly, the degree of functionalization is related to the concentration of lattice vacancy defects in the graphene material. Consequently, graphene materials that are free from lattice defects are not reactive. The reaction can be applied to graphene dispersed in solvents and leads to bitopic functionalization as well as monotopic functionalization when the graphene is deposited on surfaces. As the arylazocarboxylic tert-butyl ester moiety can be attached to various molecules, the presented method paves the way to functional graphene derivatives, with the density of defects determining the degree of functionalization."
"Pifithrin-alpha (PFT-alpha) blocks p53-dependent transcription and is an example of the many drugs being developed to target the p53 pathway in humans that could be released into the environment with potential impacts on aquatic animals if they were to become successful pharmaceuticals. In order to understand how p53 drugs might act on fish, the effects of PFT-alpha on rainbow trout gill epithelial cell line, RTgill-W1, were studied. PFT-alpha was not cytotoxic to RTgill-W1 in cultures with or without fetal bovine serum (FBS), but at 5.25 mu g/ml, PFT-alpha completely arrested proliferation. When FBS was present, PFT-alpha increased the number of polyploid cells over 12 days. Those results suggest that like in mammals, p53 appears to regulate ploidy in fish. However, several effects were seen that have not been observed with mammalian cells. PFT-alpha caused a transient rise in the mitotic index and a disruption in cytoskeletal microtubules. These results suggest that in fish cells PFT-alpha affects microtubules either directly through an off-target action on tubulin or indirectly through an on-target action on p53-regulated transcription.

"Background: Today, the most serious complication for patients with hemophilia A undergoing factor VIII (FVIII) replacement therapy is the development of neutralizing antibodies (inhibitors). Although inhibitors can be eradicated by application of high doses of FVIII, the immune tolerance induction therapy fails in up to 30% of patients. Hence, there is still an urgent need for novel therapeutic approaches for patients with persisting inhibitors. Objectives: In the present study, the potential use of immunotoxins containing exotoxin A (ETA) from Pseudomonas aeruginosa for selective elimination of FVIII-specific B cells was explored. Methods: The immunodominant C2 domain of human FVIII was used as a targeting moiety instead of the full-length FVIII protein and the resulting human C2 domain-ETA fusion protein (hC2-ETA) was produced in Escherichia coli. Results: Binding studies with monoclonal C2 domain-specific antibodies confirmed the conformational integrity of the C2 domain in hC2-ETA. The functionality of hC2-ETA was tested ex vivo by incubation of splenocytes from inhibitor-positive FVIII knockout mice with hC2-ETA and controls. FVIII-specific memory B cells from splenocytes were differentiated by FVIII stimulation in antibody-secreting cells (ASC) and detected by an enzyme-linked immunospot assay. Although the controls showed no effect, incubation of splenocytes with hC2-ETA reduced the number of C2-specific ASC in a dose-dependent fashion, indicating specific and efficient elimination of C2-specific memory B cells. Conclusions: Overall, the results of the study support the fact that FVIII domain immunotoxins might be a potential new tool for the elimination of FVIII-specific B cells in patients with hemophilia A and persisting inhibitors."

"Using the atomic density function theory (ADFT), we examine the point defect absorption at [110] symmetrical tilt grain boundaries in body-centered cubic iron. It is found that the sink strength strongly depends on misorientation angle. We also show that the ADFT is able to reproduce reasonably well the elastic properties and the point defect formation volume in alpha-iron."
"We have developed an Electron-Tracking Compton Camera (ETCC) for medical imaging and MeV gamma-ray astronomy. The ETCC consists of a gaseous Time Projection Chamber (mu-TPC) and pixel scintillator arrays. To improve the detection efficiency, we have optimized the gas mixture in the mu-TPC and operated the ETCC at high pressure. Basic characteristics such as the gas gain, drift velocity, energy resolution, and position resolution of the mu-TPC were examined, and using this optimization, both the efficiency and the angular resolution of the ETCC were measured. We achieved a steady gas gain of similar to 20,000 in Ar/CF4/isoC(4)H(10) (54:40:6) at 1.4 atm. The diffusion constant in Ar/CF4/isoC(4)H(10) (54:40:6) at 1.4 atm was similar to 2 times better than in Ar/C2H6 (90:10) at 1 atm. The efficiency in Ar/CF4/isoC(4)H(10) (54:40:6) at 1.4 atm was also similar to 2 times higher than in Ar/C2H6 (90:10) at 1 atm. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."
"In this paper, we study the linear separability problem for stochastic geometric objects under the well-known unipoint and multipoint uncertainty models. Let S = S-R boolean OR S-B be a given set of stochastic bichromatic points, and define n = min{vertical bar S-R vertical bar, vertical bar S-B vertical bar} and N = max{{vertical bar S-R vertical bar, vertical bar S-B vertical bar}. We show that the separable-probability (SP) of S can be computed in O (nN(d-1)) time for d >= 3 and 0 (min{nN log N, N-2}) time for d = 2, while the expected separation-margin (ESM) of S can be computed in O (nN(d)) time for d >= 2. In addition, we give an Omega(nN(d-1)) witness-based lower bound for computing SP, which implies the optimality of our algorithm among all those in this category. Also, a hardness result for computing ESM is given to show the difficulty of further improving our algorithm. As an extension, we generalize the same problems from points to general geometric objects, i.e., polytopes and/or balls, and extend our algorithms to solve the generalized SP and ESM problems in O (nN(d)) and O (nN(d+1)) time, respectively. Finally, we present some applications of our algorithms to stochastic convex hull-related problems. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."
"Background: Malaria endemic countries need to assess efficacy of anti-malarial treatments on a regular basis. Moreover, resistance to artemisinin that is established across mainland South-East Asia represents today a major threat to global health. Monitoring the efficacy of artemisinin-based combination therapies is of paramount importance to detect as early as possible the emergence of resistance in African countries that toll the highest burden of malaria morbidity and mortality. Methods: A WHO standard protocol was used to assess efficacy of the combinations artesunate-amodiaquine (AS-AQ Winthrop (R)), dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine (DHA-PPQ, Eurartesim (R)) and artemether-lumefantrine (AM-LM, Coartem (R)) taken under supervision and respecting pharmaceutical recommendations. The study enrolled for each treatment arm 212 children aged 6-59 months living in Maradi (Niger) and suffering with uncomplicated falciparum malaria. The Kaplan-Meier 42-day PCR-adjusted cure rate was the primary outcome. A standardized parasite clearance estimator was used to assess delayed parasite clearance as surrogate maker of suspected artemisinin resistance. Results: No early treatment failures were found in any of the study treatment arms. The day-42 PCR-adjusted cure rate estimates were 99.5, 98.4 and 99.0% in the AS-AQ, DHA-PPQ and AM-LM arms, respectively. The reinfection rate (expressed also as Kaplan-Meier estimates) was higher in the AM-LM arm (32.4%) than in the AS-AQ (13.8%) and the DHA-PPQ arm (24.9%). The parasite clearance rate constant was 0.27, 0.26 and 0.25 per hour for AS-AQ, DHA-PPQ and AM-LM, respectively. Conclusions: All the three treatments evaluated largely meet WHO criteria (at least 95% efficacy). AS-AQ and AL-LM may continue to be used and DHA-PPQ may be also recommended as first-line treatment for uncomplicated falciparum malaria in Maradi. The parasite clearance rate were consistent with reference values indicating no suspected artemisinin resistance. Nevertheless, the monitoring of anti-malarial drug efficacy should continue."
"The complex interplay between turbulence, magnetic fields, and self-gravity leads to the formation of molecular clouds out of the diffuse interstellar medium (ISM). One avenue of studying this interplay is by analyzing statistical features derived from observations, where the interpretation of these features is greatly facilitated by comparisons with numerical simulations. Here we focus on the statistical anisotropy present in synthetic maps of velocity centroid data, which we derive from three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic simulations of a turbulent, magnetized, self-gravitating patch of ISM. We study how the orientation and magnitude of the velocity anisotropy correlate with the magnetic field and with the structures generated by gravitational collapse. Motivated by recent observational constraints, our simulations focus on the supersonic (sonic Mach number M approximate to 2-17) but sub-to trans-alfvenic (alfvenic Mach number. M-.A approximate to 0.2-1.2) turbulence regime, and we consider clouds that are barely to mildly magnetically supercritical (mass-to-flux ratio equal to once or twice the critical value). Additionally we explore the impact of the turbulence driving mechanism (solenoidal or compressive) on the velocity anisotropy. While we confirm previous findings that the velocity anisotropy generally aligns well with the plane-of-sky magnetic field, our inclusion of the effects of self-gravity reveals that in regions of higher column density, the velocity anisotropy may be destroyed or even reoriented to align with the gravitationally formed structures. We provide evidence that this effect is not necessarily due to the increase of. A inside the high-density regions."
"Background: Several factors determine the choice of medications in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). We aimed to analyze the pattern of prescription of drugs in patients with PD before attending a tertiary-care center. Methods: The study included chart review of 800 PD patients attending the Department of Neurology of the National Institute of Mental Health and Neurosciences in Bangalore, India. Results: The mean age at onset was 51.1 +/- 11.8 years. The mean duration of illness was 41.7 +/- 43.6 months. At first visit, 79.4% (group 1, n = 635) of patients were on medications, 10% (group 2, n = 80) were on medications but later discontinued, and 10.6% (group 3, n = 85) were drug-naive. Overall, levodopa was prescribed in 94.8%, trihexyphenidyl in 40.4%, dopamine agonists in 23.2%, and amantadine in 17.2% either as monotherapy or in combination. In group 1, 37.8% were on monotherapy, with levodopa being the most commonly used agent (33.1%), followed by trihexyphenidyl (2.2%), dopamine agonists (1.6%), and amantadine (0.6%). Among those on polytherapy, levodopa plus trihexyphenidyl was the preferred combination (23.9%). In group 2, levodopa monotherapy was also most common (72.5%), followed by trihexyphenidyl monotherapy (7.5%). Conclusions: Levodopa and trihexyphenidyl were the most commonly prescribed drugs in our patients. A higher use of trihexyphenidyl could be due to its easy availability, low cost, and better tolerability in our patients, who were relatively young at the time of onset of their disease. The choice of antiparkinsonian medications at the primary and secondary care levels in India may be inappropriate, and newer guidelines tailored to the Indian context are warranted."
"Background: Adenoma Detection Rate (ADR) is a validated colonoscopy quality indicator. In addition to overall ADR, Distal and Proximal Adenoma Detection Rates may provide important colonoscopy quality information. The goal of this study is to determine the association between distal and proximal adenoma detection (AD) and to identify factors contributing to overall, distal, and proximal AD. Methods: This is a retrospective cohort study of patients with a noted family history of CRC or positive fecal occult blood test who underwent a screening colonoscopy at a regional colorectal cancer (CRC) screening center between May 2009 and December 2011. Data regarding patient demographics, procedure details, endoscopist characteristics and polyp histology were captured. The main outcomes measured were overall, distal, and proximal AD. Results: 1907 patients were included. The median age was 60 years and 42% were male. Endoscopist median overall ADR was 25% (30% male, 21% female). Endoscopist distal ADR was only modestly associated with their proximal ADR (Spearman Rank: 0.51 p = 0.11). Highest overall ADR (29 to 45%) was found for endoscopists whose distal and proximal ADRs were above the group median. In multivariate analysis, factors associated with overall, distal, and proximal AD included age, sex, and endoscopist practicing experience. Conclusion: Inclusion of distal and proximal ADRs, in addition to overall ADR, in colonoscopy quality assessment provides the more accurate feedback on endoscopist performance."
"We show that a double Lie algebroid, together with a chosen decomposition, is equivalent to a pair of 2-term representations up to homotopy satisfying compatibility conditions which extend the notion of matched pair of Lie algebroids. We discuss in detail the double Lie algebroids arising from the tangent bundle of a Lie algebroid and the cotangent bundle of a Lie bialgebroid."
"In this work, we reported a simple and sensitive electrochemical method for nitrite detection via Griess reaction. Specifically, naphthylethylenediamine (NEA) was immobilized onto the gold electrode to form positively charged self-assembled monolayers (SAMs). The positive charges on electrode facilitated the access of the negatively charged [Fe(CN)(6)](3 /4) probes to the electrode surface. The nitrite-mediated Griess reaction between NEA and sulphanilic acid (SA) on the electrode surface leaded to the formation of negatively charged SAMs, which produced a barrier for the electron transfer between the redox probe and the electrode. The results were demonstrated by cyclic voltammetry and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. The increase in the impedance of NEA-modified electrodes is proportional to the increase of nitrite concentration. A detection limit of 20 nM for nitrite detection was achieved."
"Background: Cereal crops and oilseeds provide diverse pool of fatty acids with characteristic properties. Sorghum (Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench) provides the staple food with serving as main source of energy and protein. Germination of sorghum generally increases the nutritive value of seeds and the effects of germination on lipids composition of seeds vary greatly with processing conditions. Therefore, the current study was conducted to compare the effect of emerging processing techniques such as ultrasound (US) and microwave (MW) on fatty acids composition and oil yield of sorghum seeds before and after germination. Methods: Initially sorghum grains were soaked with 5% NaOCl (sodium hypochlorite) for surface sterilization. Afterwards, grains were soaked in excess water for 22 h at room temperature and were divided into four portions. The first portion (100 g grains) was subjected to germination without applying any microwave and ultrasonic treatment (T-0). Second portion was further divided into four groups (T-1, T-2, T-3, T-4) (100 g of each group) and grains were subjected to ultrasonic treatments using two different ultrasonic intensities (US1: 40%; US2: 60%) within range of 0-100% and with two different time durations (tUS(1): 5 min; tUS(2): 10 min) at constant temperature. Third portion was also divided into four groups (T-1, T-2, T-3, T-4) (100 g of each group) and exposed to microwave treatments at two different power levels (MW1: 450 watt; MW2: 700 watt) within the range of 100-900 W for two different time durations (tMW(1): 15 s; tMW(2): 30s). Similarly, fourth portion was divided into four groups (T-1, T-2, T-3, T-4) (100 g of each group). Each group was exposed to both MW (MW1, MW2) (100-900 watt power) & US (US1, US2) (0-100% intensity) treatments at two different time levels (tUS, tMW). Then, germination was carried out and pre-treated raw and pre-treated germinated sorghum grains were analyzed for total oil yield, fatty acid composition and unsaturated fatty acids (Un-SFA)/saturated fatty acids (SFA) ratio by gas chromatography. Results: The results revealed that oil yield in sorghum before and after germination ranged from 6.55 to 7.84% and 6.28 to 7.57%, respectively. All the microwave and ultrasound processed samples showed significant difference in oil yield than the raw sorghum grains. The highest tested yield was 7.84 +/- 0.31% when combination of microwave power (700 W) and ultrasound intensity (60%) was applied for 30s and 10 min, respectively. The results further demonstrate that the raw sorghum contained palmitic (13.73 +/- 0.10%), palmitoleic (0.43 +/- 0.02%), stearic (1.07 +/- 0.04%), oleic (37.15 +/- 0.10%), linoleic (43.33 +/- 0.21%), linolenic (1.55 +/- 0.04%), arachidic acid (0.13 +/- 0.01%) and eicosenoic acid (0.37 +/- 0.02%), respectively. The highest fatty acid percentage for palmitic, stearic and arachidic acid was 13.75 +/- 0.07%, 1.11 0.09% and 0.15 +/- 0.03% at 60% US intensity for 10 min (T-4), respectively. Maximum amount observed was 1.60 +/- 0.09% of linolenic acid while amount of eicosenoic acid decreased from 0.37 +/- 0.02% to 0.31 +/- 0.01% after processing. In case of applying combination of microwave and sonication treatments, the change in eicosenoic acid increased from 0.35 +/- 0.02% to 0. 40 +/- 0.04% while there was no significant change in other fatty acids. The ungerminated sorghum oil possessed 14.93-15.05% and 82.83-83.12% of SFA and Un-SFA, respectively. After germination, percentage of saturated fatty acids increased (16.4-16.55%) while decreased for unsaturated fatty acids (80.13-80.56%) were noted. Conclusions: The results of the present study conclude that the yield of oil from sorghum grains increased by emerging processing. Fatty acid analysis of sorghum oil suggested that pre-treatment strategies will not affect the quality of the oil with respect to essential fatty acids content. Overall, the composition of saturated fatty acid in germinated grain is improved than ungerminated grains after processing."
"In this article, time-series models are developed to represent three alternative, potential monetary policy regimes as monetary policy returns to normal. The first regime is a return to the high and volatile inflation rate of the 1970s. The second regime, the one expected by most Federal Reserve officials and business economists, is a return to the credible low inflation policy that characterized the U.S. economy from 1983 to 2007, a period known as the Great Moderation. The third regime is one in which policymakers keep policy interest rates at or near zero for the foreseeable future; Japanese data are used to estimate this regime. These time-series models include four variables: per capita gross domestic product growth, consumer price index inflation, the policy rate, and the 10-year government bond rate. These models are used to forecast the U.S. economy from 2008 through 2013 and represent the possible outcomes for interest rates that may follow the return of monetary policy to normal. Here, ""normal"" depends on the policy regime that follows the liftoff of the federal funds rate target expected in mid-2015."
"Controlling spin current and magnetic exchange coupling by applying an electric field and achieving high spin injection efficiency at the same time in a nanostructure coupled to ferromagnetic electrodes have been the outstanding challenges in nanoscale spintronics. A relentless quest is going on to find new low-dimensional materials with tunable spin dependent properties to address these challenges. Herein, we predict, from first-principles, the transverse-electric-field induced switching in the sign of exchange coupling and tunnel magneto-resistance in a boron nitride nanotube quantum dot attached to ferromagnetic nickel contacts. An orbital dependent density functional theory in conjunction with a single particle Green's function approach is used to study the spin dependent current. The origin of switching is attributed to the electric field induced modification of magnetic exchange interaction at the interface caused by the Stark effect. In addition, spin injection efficiency is found to vary from 61% to 89% depending upon the magnetic configurations at the electrodes. These novel findings are expected to open up a new pathway for the application of boron nitride nanotube quantum dots in next generation nanoscale spintronics."
"This study was done to evaluate the effects of lead nitrate and mercury chloride in testis tissues of Wistar rats. Lead nitrate and mercury chloride are widely used heavy metals in industry. Oral lead and mercury administrations to adult male rats at doses 45 mg/kg bw and 0.02 mg/kg bw, respectively for 4 weeks caused a significant increasing in MDA levels and antioxidant enzyme activities (SOD, CAT, GPx and GST). The MDA levels and acivities of antioxidant enzymes was lower in rats that were administrated by lead nitrate than mercury chloride treated group. Light microscopic analyses revealed that lead nitrate and mercury chloride induced numerous histopathological changes in testis tissues of rats. Histopathological observations of the testis tissues showed that mercury chloride caused more harmful effects than lead nitrate, too. The results indicate that lead nitrate and mercury chloride have reproductive toxicity, in male rats at the tested doses. The effect which we observed applying the lead nitrate and mercury chloride together, was more greater than when we used them alone."
"A remarkably simple synthetic method has been described for the access of structurally diverse 3,4-dihydropyrimidin-2(1H)-ones in excellent yields in the presence of 2,4,6-trichloro-1,3,5-triazine (TCT) as an efficient source of hydrochloric acid under ultrasound radiation. In this tandem reaction, a range of aldehydes, -diketo esters and urea were made to condense together via one-pot, solvent-free synthetic strategy. Use of metal-free catalyst, readily accessible substrates, high production rate and ease of work-up are the imperative features of this protocol. [GRAPHICS] ."
"Enthalpies of dissolution of tetrapyridylporphyrin (TPyP) derivatives, in which the pyridine nitrogen is located in para-, meta- or ortho-positions and is modified by nonpolar (-CH3,-C2H5,-C3H7), polar (-CH2COOH, -CH2CH2COOH) and low-polar (-CH2COOC2H5) groups, are determined in water by calorimetric method for the first time. The factors, making considerable impact in enthalpies of dissolution of the studied compounds in water, are revealed."
"Background: Mould exposure has been linked to childhood asthma and bronchial hyper-responsiveness. Few studies have assessed beta-(1,3)-d-glucan (beta-glucan), a significant fungal cell wall constituent, in relation to asthma in adolescence. Objective: To determine whether house dust-derived beta-glucan exposure at age 7-10 is associated with the development and persistence of atopic and non-atopic asthma, and bronchial hyper-responsiveness (BHR) by age 11-14. Methods: Dust samples were collected from the 1995 Study of Asthma, Genes, and Environment (SAGE) birth cohort. This cohort was derived from Manitoba provincial healthcare administrative records of children high and low risk for asthma. Samples were collected from the homes of 422 children at age 7-10 and analyzed using beta-glucan and endotoxin-specific Limulus Amoebocyte Lysate assays. Asthma, atopy, and BHR status of each child were also assessed at ages 7-10 and 11-14. Results: At age 7-10, beta-glucan dust levels in the home were associated with persistent atopic asthma at age 11-14 (OR 1.79 for each unit increase in levels, 95% CI 1.14-2.81), independent of endotoxin exposure, and Alternaria or Cladosporium sensitization. The likelihood of BHR almost doubled with unit increases in dust beta-glucan in asthmatic children. In children without asthma, exposure to high beta-glucan levels at age 7-10 also elevated risk for BHR in adolescence (OR 1.74, 95% CI 1.05-2.89). New-onset atopic asthma was twice more likely following high beta-glucan exposure in children without asthma but the association did not reach statistical significance. No associations were evident with concurrent asthma phenotype at age 7-10 or non-atopic asthma at age 11-14. Conclusion: These findings implicate home beta-glucan exposure at school-age as a risk factor for persistent atopic asthma and new-onset BHR. The higher prevalence of BHR in urban adolescents may be propagated by this home exposure."
"In this paper we present X2R, a system for integrating heterogeneous data sources in an ontological knowledge base. The main goal of the system is to create a unified view of information stored in relational, XML and LDAP data sources within an organization, expressed in RDF using a common ontology and valid according to a prescribed set of integrity constraints. X2R supports a wide range of source schemas and target ontologies by allowing the user to define potentially complex transformations of data between the original data source and the unified knowledge base. A rich set of integrity constraint primitives has been provided to ensure the quality of the unified data set. They are also leveraged in a novel approach towards semantic optimization of SPARQL queries."
"AimsCoronary inflammation and healing influence outcomes of diabetic patients treated with Percutaneous coronary revascularization (PCI). Stents covered with biodegradable polymers (bp) may offer advantages over nonerodible polymer ones, because polymer reabsorption extinguish coronary inflammation and favours healing. Aim of our study was to assess the safety and efficacy of bp-biolimus-eluting stent (bp-BES) in a large series of consecutive diabetic patients.MethodsFrom 2009 to 2013 we retrospectively enrolled consecutive diabetic patients treated with PCI and bp-BES implantation. Primary end points were target lesion revascularization (TLR) and stent thrombosis rates.ResultsStudy cohort counted 747 patients. Multivessel disease was present in 48.2% with a mean stent/patient ratio of 1.860.78. During the hospital stay no stent thrombosis occurred. At 3-year follow-up we observed a 1.5% cumulative incidence of cardiac death, 1.1% of myocardial infarction and 6.3% of TLR. Stent thrombosis occurred in 1.1% of patients, all in the first 2years of follow-up. Kaplan-Meier analysis showed a TLR-free survival at 1 and 3years of 97.2 and 96.1%, respectively.ConclusionPCI with bp-BES seems to be well tolerated and effective in a large unselected population of diabetic patients. The good results observed were maintained at 3years of follow-up."
"In this work, six different series of iron based soft magnetic composites are produced and studied: (1) passive iron powder; (2) passive iron powder-0.7% resin with coupling agent: (3) passive iron powder-0.7% resin without coupling agent; (4) passive iron powder-1.5% resin with coupling agent; (5) passive iron powder-1.5% resin without coupling agent: (6) pure iron-1.5% resin. The specimens were shaped as cylindrical rods and characterized by fourier transform infrared spectrometer (FTIR), energy dispersive analyzer (EDX), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and indutance capacitance resistance (LCR) meter. The results show that the hysteresis loss coefficient is close to each other for all the samples (0.0011 < k(2) < 0.0019), but the eddy current loss coefficient is higher for the passive-0.7% resin sample without coupling agent (k(3) = 0.005) in comparison with the other samples.

"Control of organellar assembly and function is critical to eukaryotic homeostasis and survival. Gle1 is a highly conserved regulator of RNA-dependent DEAD-box ATPase proteins, with critical roles in both mRNA export and translation. In addition to its well-defined interaction with nuclear pore complexes, here we find that Gle1 is enriched at the centrosome and basal body. Gle1 assembles into the toroid-shaped pericentriolar material around the mother centriole. Reduced Gle1 levels are correlated with decreased pericentrin localization at the centrosome and microtubule organization defects. Of importance, these alterations in centrosome integrity do not result from loss of mRNA export. Examination of the Kupffer's vesicle in Gle1-depleted zebrafish revealed compromised ciliary beating and developmental defects. We propose that Gle1 assembly into the pericentriolar material positions the DEAD-box protein regulator to function in localized mRNA metabolism required for proper centrosome function."
"The aim of this study was to investigate variation in biomass allocation and community composition of submerged macrophytes to elucidate the effect of sediment depth on the growth and species diversity of submerged macrophytes. Field investigations were conducted in 36 sampling sites located across Lake Taihu, China; six plant species were found and communities were dominated by Potamogeton malaianus and Vallisneria natans. The results showed that the plant-sediment distribution relationship was supported by a biological trait (biomass index) and a strong predictive power of sediment depth to plant biomass, and the occurrence selectivity of submerged macrophytes toward relatively firm bottoms could be demonstrated along the eastern shore. Root and stem biomass were strongly positively correlated to sediment depth over a range from 0.1 to 0.25 m (p < 0.01), and approximately 0.25 m could be regarded as an upper limit for depth effect on the growth of submerged macrophytes. The results also demonstrated that species varied in their responses to sediment conditions, which influenced the community composition of submerged macrophytes. The observed pattern suggests the effect of sediment on growth and community composition is an important aspect restricting the restoration of submerged macrophytes."
"In order to improve the monitoring performance of the intelligent sea metal pollution in the port, the control system of the intelligent monitoring and warning equipment for the heavy metal pollution in the port is designed. This paper presents an intelligent monitoring and warning equipment control system for sea metal pollution in port based on DSP. The dual 16-bit fixed-point DSP is used as the intelligent information processing chip for the intelligent monitoring of heavy metal pollution in the port, and the real-time sampling of the heavy metal pollution in the port is carried out. The pollution of heavy metal pollutants in port seawater was detected by both visual analysis and chemical analysis. The hardware module of the system is mainly divided into the port seawater heavy metal pollution material sensing information collection module, the pollution substance detection pattern recognition module, the remote terminal communication transmission control module and the man-machine interaction module and so on. The program control module of MUX101 is designed to alarm and control the heavy metal pollution of sea water in port intelligently, and the software development and design of the control system of pollution monitoring and warning equipment is carried out under the embedded kernel. Finally, the experimental results show that the system can be used to monitor the pollution of sea water intelligently and accurately and in real time."
"Current guidelines differ slightly on the recommendations for treatment of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) patients, and although there are some undisputed recommendations, there is still debate regarding the management of COPD. One of the hindrances to deciding which therapeutic approach to choose is late diagnosis or misdiagnosis of COPD. After a proper diagnosis is achieved and severity assessed, the choice between a stepwise or ""hit hard"" approach has to be made. For GOLD A patients the stepwise approach is recommended, whilst for B, C and D patients this remains debatable. Moreover, in patients for whom inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) are recommended, a step-up or ""hit hard"" approach with triple therapy will depend on the patient's characteristics and, for patients who are being over-treated with ICS, ICS withdrawal should be performed, in order to optimize therapy and reduce excessive medications. This paper discusses and proposes stepwise, ""hit hard"", step-up and ICS withdrawal therapeutic approaches for COPD patients based on their GOLD group. We conclude that all approaches have benefits, and only a careful patient selection will determine which approach is better, and which patients will benefit the most from each approach.

"The Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway plays a significant role in the control of osteoblastogenesis and bone formation. CXXC finger protein 5 (CXXC5) has been recently identified as a negative feedback regulator of osteoblast differentiation through a specific interaction with Dishevelled (Dvl) protein. It was reported that targeting the Dvl-CXXC5 interaction could be a novel anabolic therapeutic target for osteoporosis. In this study, complex structure of Dvl PDZ domain and CXXC5 peptide was simulated with molecular dynamics (MD). Based on the structural analysis of binding modes of MD-simulated Dvl PDZ domain with CXXC5 peptide and crystal Dvl PDZ domain with synthetic peptide-ligands, we generated two different pharmacophore models and applied pharmacophore-based virtual screening to discover potent inhibitors of the Dvl-CXXC5 interaction for the anabolic therapy of osteoporosis. Analysis of 16 compounds selected by means of a virtual screening protocol yielded four compounds that effectively disrupted the Dvl-CXXC5 interaction in the fluorescence polarization assay. Potential compounds were validated by fluorescence spectroscopy and nuclear magnetic resonance. We successfully identified a highly potent inhibitor, BMD4722, which directly binds to the Dvl PDZ domain and disrupts the Dvl-CXXC5 interaction. Overall, CXXC5-Dvl PDZ domain complex based pharmacophore combined with various traditional and simple computational methods is a promising approach for the development of modulators targeting the Dvl-CXXC5 interaction, and the potent inhibitor BMD4722 could serve as a starting point to discover or design more potent and specific the Dvl-CXXC5 interaction disruptors."
"In this work, the corrosion mechanism of a Cu-5Zn-5Al-1Sn alloy was examined in a 3.5 wt.% NaCl solution. At the same time, the effect of a cysteine inhibitor was also investigated through a multi-analytical approach. Electrochemical results suggested that inhibition efficiency increased with the increase of cysteine concentration. From potentiodynamic polarization (PD) analysis, a decrease in corrosion current and corrosion potential shift toward a more negative direction was observed. The potential difference between the blank and inhibited surface was found to be 46 mV, which is less than 85 mV, revealing a mixed type inhibition effect of cysteine for the Cu-5Zn-5Al-1Sn alloy. The inhibition mechanism of cysteine (Cys) and the effect of alloying elements were investigated by fitting experimental impedance data according to a projected equivalent circuit for the alloy/electrolyte interface. A Langmuir adsorption isotherm was proposed to explain the inhibition phenomenon of cysteine on the Cu-5Zn-5Al-1Sn alloy surface. Surface morphology observation confirmed that the Cu-5Zn-5Al-1Sn alloy was damaged in 3.5 wt.% NaCl solution and could be inhibited by using the cysteine inhibitor. The impact of alloying elements on the corrosion mechanism was further examined by surface analysis techniques such as X-Ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS)/Auger spectra, the results of which indicated that the corrosion inhibition was realized by the adsorption of the inhibitor molecules at the alloy/solution interface."
"Background and Purpose-Different distributions of cerebral microbleeds (CMBs) are associated with distinct pathological mechanisms. Lobar CMBs are thought to be related to cerebral amyloid angiopathy, whereas deep or infratentorial CMBs are related to hypertensive vasculopathy. The present study aimed to evaluate the effects of CMBs and their locations on a variety of cognitive domains. Methods-Study subjects were selected from the community-based I-Lan Longitudinal Aging Study. We assessed cognitive domains, including verbal memory, language, visuospatial executive function, and verbal executive function. CMBs were evaluated using 3T susceptibility-weighted magnetic resonance imaging. Results-We studied 959 subjects (mean +/- SD, 62.5 +/- 8.6 years; 425 [44.3%] men). CMBs were found in 14.2% of the population. We classified subjects with CMBs into 2 different groups based on the locations of their CMBs: (1) deep or infratentorial (85 subjects, 8.8% of population) and (2) strictly lobar (49, 5.1%). Multivariate linear analysis showed that strictly lobar CMBs were significantly associated with deficits in global cognitive function (Mini-Mental State Examination) and visuospatial executive function, as determined by the copy test of the Taylor complex figure test and the clock drawing test. We adjusted our results for age, sex, years of education, cardiovascular risk factors, and other markers of cerebral small vessel disease, lacunes, and white matter hyperintensity. Deep or infratentorial CMBs were not associated with changes in cognitive function in our population. Conclusions-Strictly lobar, but not deep or infratentorial, CMBs are associated with changes in cognitive function, especially in visuospatial executive functions. Cerebral amyloid angiopathy may be the underlying pathology associated with CMB-related cognitive impairment."
"Natural and anthropogenic sources of nitrous oxide were considered, and their contribution to environmental pollution was determined. The effect of N2O on Earth's ozone layer was described. The commercial method of production of technical and medical nitrous oxide, based on decomposition of a hot solution of ammonia nitrate, was considered. Application areas of nitrous oxide were described, and examples of its use in organic and inorganic synthesis reactions, as well as in medicine, food industry, and technology were given. Methods employed for neutralizing process gases containing nitrogen oxides, in particular absorption and adsorption methods, were reviewed. Particular attention was paid to catalytic tail gas purification in various industries; high- and low-temperature reduction of N2O by natural gas and ammonia were described; analytical review of the literature dedicated to catalytic systems and individual compounds that show activity in the decomposition and reduction of nitrous oxide was provided; and mechanisms of nitrous oxide decomposition over various catalysts were considered."
"In her article ""Vicarious Victimhood as Post-Holocaust Jewish Identity in Erica Fischer's Auto/Biography Aimee and Jaguar"" Anne Rothe reads the Austrian-Jewish journalist's interview-based dual biography in autobiographical terms. Taking recourse to such para-texts as the preface and epilogue, in which Fischer reflects on her own subject position, in addition to the auto/biographical narrative itself, Rothe critiques the notion of constructing secular Jewish identity based on the notion of vicarious or hereditary Holocaust victimhood. This provocative new reading reveals that the biography Fischer wrote constitutes a counter-narrative to the story her main collaborator, Lilly Wust, told the author about her short-lived love affair with Felice Schragenheim, who was killed in the Holocaust and whom Wust mourned for the rest of her life. Rothe furthermore argues that Fischer rewrites Wust's story to the extent of denying her core identity of vicarious Holocaust victimhood, only to claim this epistemologically and ethically untenable but culturally dominant and coveted subject position for herself."
"Purpose: To evaluate the performance of machine learning (ML)-based computed tomography (CT) radiomics analysis for discriminating between low grade (WHO/ISUP I-II) and high grade (WHO/ISUP III-IV) clear cell renal cell carcinomas (ccRCCs). Methods: A total of 164 low grade and 107 high grade ccRCCs were retrospectively analyzed in this study. Radiomic features were extracted from corticomedullary phase (CMP) and nephrographic phase (NP) CT images. Intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) was calculated to quantify the feature's reproducibility. The training and validation cohort consisted of 163 and 108 cases. Least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression method was used for feature selection. The machine learning (ML) classifiers were k-NearestNeighbor (KNN), Logistic Regression (LR), multilayer perceptron (MLP), Random Forest (RF), and support vector machine (SVM). The performance of classifiers was mainly evaluated and compared by certain metrics. Results: Seven CMP features (ICC range, 0.990-0.999) and seven NP features (ICC range, 0.931-0.999) were selected. The accuracy of CMP, NP and the combination of CMP and NP ranged from 82.2%-85.9 %, 82.8%-94.5 % and 86.5%-90.8 % in the training cohort, and 90.7%-95.4%, 77.8%-79.6 % and 91.7%-93.5 % in the validation cohort. The AUC of CMP, NP and the combination of CMP and NP ranged from 0.901 to 0.938, 0.912 to 0.976, 0.948 to 0.968 in the training cohort, and 0.957 to 0.974, 0.856 to 0.875, 0.960 to 0.978 in the validation cohort. Conclusions: ML-based CT radiomics analysis can be used to predict the WHO/ISUP grade of ccRCCs preoperatively."
"Introduction: To evaluate if the volume-corrected renal artery pulsatility index (vcRA-PI) is more closely related to the amniotic fluid level than the uncorrected or the gestational age (GA)-adjusted RA-PI. Methods: RA-PI and kidney volume were measured in low- and high-risk pregnancies at 17-38 weeks. Fetal anomalies associated with nonrenal causes of abnormal amniotic fluid volume were excluded. The vcRA-PI was calculated by dividing the RA-PI by the renal volume. The RA-PI was adjusted for GA, to obtain the GA-adjusted RA-PI. The uncorrected, GA-adjusted, and the vcRA-PI were related to the amniotic fluid level using nonparametric tests and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analyses. Results: 146 examinations from 59 pregnancies were reviewed. Of these, 16 had oligo- and 15 had polyhydramnios. A higher vcRA-PI was associated with oligohydramnios (OR 2.54, 95% CI 1.67-3.86, p < 0.001), while the uncorrected 0.72-0.94). On the other hand, the uncorrected RA-PI and GA-adjusted RA-PI significantly predicted polyhydramnios (p = 0.04 and 0.02, respectively), while the vcRA-PI did not. Conclusion: The vcRA-PI is superior to the uncorrected and ;the GA-adjusted RA-PI in predicting oligohydramnios. (C) 2018 S. Karger AG, Basel"
"In the current study, we examined how student characteristics and cognitive skills, differing levels of text complexity (cohesion, decoding, vocabulary, and syntax), and reading comprehension question types (literal, inferential, critical analysis, and reading strategy) affected different types of reading outcomes (multiple-choice reading comprehension questions, free recall, and oral reading fluency) in a sample of 181 native English-speaking adolescents (9 to 14.83years). Results from item response theory one-parameter models and multilevel models suggested that different cognitive skills predicted performance across the three reading outcomes. After controlling for student characteristics and cognitive skills, text complexity negatively impacted reading outcomes, particularly oral reading fluency and free recall. Critical analysis and inferential questions emerged as the most difficult types of comprehension questions. The implications of these findings are discussed."
"Nurse educators, at every level of pre-licensure nursing education, are charged with developing critical thinking skills within their students. Post-clinical conference is one teaching strategy that nurse educators can employ to help promote the development of critical thinking skills in pre-licensure nursing students. However, traditional face-to-face post-clinical conference is marred with issues and concerns, as identified in the nursing education literature. An alternative to face-to-face post-clinical conference, asynchronous online learning environment, mitigates the issues and concerns associated with traditional post-clinical conference. Adult learning theory supports the use of asynchronous online learning environment because the asynchronous online learning environment promotes student-centered teaching strategy in place of teacher-centered learning, which by its nature traditional face-to-face post-clinical conference tends to support.

"A successful metal hydride application is closely related to an optimized design of the storage hydrogen system. In previous studies, Hardy and Anton developed scoping and numerical models describing phenomena occurring during the loading process in an alanate storage system having the configuration of a cylindrical shell, tube and fin heat exchanger. In this paper, the numerical tool is used to evaluate the influence of varying the fin thickness and the number of heat exchanger tubes on both the loading and discharging processes. The objective is to evaluate the influence of the geometric parameters of these heat exchangers on the management of heat to be removed/supplied during the sorption process and thus optimize the loading/discharging times; while having the maximum possible volume for containing the hydride and the lightest weight of the storage system. Results showed that equipping the storage system with fins fitted to the heat exchanger tubes is the best design for efficient use of the hydride bed. In the absence of fins, a number of optimal tubes is determined, however, the hydrogen uptake rate is still lower than one obtained for the finned case and there is a reduction of volumetric and gravimetric storage capacities by comparison to the finned system.

"The positive effects of root-colonizing bacteria cooperating with plants lead to improved growth and/or health of their eukaryotic hosts. Some of these Plant Growth-Promoting Rhizobacteria (PGPR) display several plant-beneficial properties, suggesting that the accumulation of the corresponding genes could have been selected in these bacteria. Here, this issue was targeted using 23 genes contributing directly or indirectly to established PGPR effects, based on genome sequence analysis of 304 contrasted Alpha-Beta- and Gammaproteobacteria. Most of the 23 genes studied were also found in non-PGPR Proteobacteria and none of them were common to all 25 PGPR genomes studied. However, ancestral character reconstruction indicated that gene transfers -predominantly ancient-resulted in characteristic gene combinations according to taxonomic subgroups of PGPR strains. This suggests that the PGPR-plant cooperation could have established separately in various taxa, yielding PGPR strains that use different gene assortments. The number of genes contributing to plant-beneficial functions increased along the continuum - animal pathogens, phytopathogens, saprophytes, endophytes/symbionts, PGPR- indicating that the accumulation of these genes (and possibly of different plant-beneficial traits) might be an intrinsic PGPR feature. This work uncovered preferential associations occurring between certain genes contributing to phytobeneficial traits and provides new insights into the emergence of PGPR bacteria."
"Two types of ternary composites were fabricated by reversing the deposition sequence of polyaniline (PANI) and MnO2 layers on plasma treated carbon cloth (m-CC), i.e., PANI@MnO2@m-CC and MnO2@PANI@m-CC. By comparison, PANI@MnO2@m-CC displayed a unique porous structure and possessed a better electrochemical performance than that of MnO2@PANI@m-CC. The morphological transformation of MnO2 petals into nanoparticles while anchoring PANI nanorods increases the interactions between the two pseudoactive materials. An asymmetric supercapacitor was fabricated by using PANI@MnO2@m-CC as the positive electrode and activated microwave exfoliated graphite oxide ('a-MEGO')@m-CC as the negative electrode. The asymmetric supercapacitor showed a maximum energy density of 33.9 W h kg(-1) (at a power density of 319.0 W kg(-1)) and power density of 17.2 kW kg(-1) (at an energy density of 14.3 W h kg(-1)) at an operating voltage of 2.0 V, suggesting PANI@MnO2@m-CC is a promising electrode candidate for supercapacitors."
"During the terminal stages of Wilson cycles, remnants of magma-poor margins may be incorporated into the orogens, whereas the magma-rich margins often are lost in subduction due to low buoyancy. The understanding of magma-rich margins is therefore mostly based on drill holes and geophysical observations. In this contribution, we explore the temporal evolution and the ambient conditions of a magma-rich rifted margin preserved within the Scandinavian Caledonides. The Scandinavian Dike Complex was emplaced into a sedimentary basin during the initial breakup and opening of the Iapetus Ocean 615 to 590 million years ago. The dike complex constitutes 70-90% of the magma-rich, syn-rift basins and is locally well preserved despite the complex Caledonian history. This contribution provides new observations about the geometry, relative timing, and development of the margin. Jadeite-in-clinopyroxene geothermobarometry, titanium-in-biotite geothermometry, and garnet isopleth modeling show that the ambient pressure and temperature conditions were similar for the entire dike complex at 0.25 to 0.45GPa, with contact metamorphic temperatures up to approximately 700 degrees C. In the northernmost part of the study area, U-Pb dating of magmatic zircon shows that partial melting of the sedimentary host rock, at relatively shallow levels, occurred at 612Ma. This shows that the crust was molten already 6 million years before the northernmost dike swarm was emplaced at 605.71.8Ma. We propose that the locally pervasive partial melting occurred due to high geothermal gradients and introduction of mafic melt in the lower crust. These processes significantly reduced the strength of the crust, eventually facilitating continental breakup. Plain Language Summary This project investigates what the crust looks like and how it behaves when continents are rifting and finally break apart to form a new ocean. Sometimes the breakup is associated with magmatism. When this is the case the structure and behavior of the crust change dramatically from their state when no magma is involved. One important implication is that the heat brought by the magma presumably makes the crust very hot and weak and thus easier to break. Direct observations of magma-rich rifted margins are sparse, but in an area of Scandinavia, the deep parts of a rift in the Earth's crust have been preserved and exposed through complex geological processes. The study of these rocks reveals the processes that were active at depth when the continents broke apart. We have used mineral chemistry and age dating to show that the studied areas formed at approximately 9- to 16-km depth more than 600 million years ago. Our observations indicate that the stretching started when the crust was relatively cold, possibly causing earthquakes. Later, the crust was heated by magma intrusions to such a degree that it started to melt and became very weak, which made it easier to stretch and break the continent apart."
"Pathological image analysis plays a significant role in effective disease diagnostics. In this article, a tool for diagnosis assistance by automatic segmentation of bone marrow images is introduced. The aim of our segmentation is to demarcate cell's component: nucleus, cytoplasm, red cells, and background. Different color spaces were used to extract color's features to profit of their complementarity. We introduce several dimensionality reduction techniques. These techniques are exemplified on a support vector machine pixel-based bone marrow image segmentation problem in which it is shown that it may give significant improvement in segmentation accuracy and time consuming.

"Purpose of reviewCrowdsourcing involves the use of the collective intelligence of online communities to produce solutions and outcomes for defined objectives. The use of crowdsourcing is growing in many scientific areas. Crowdsourcing in ophthalmology has been used in basic science and clinical research; however, it also shows promise as a method with wide-ranging applications. This review presents current findings on the use of crowdsourcing in ophthalmology and potential applications in the future.Recent findingsCrowdsourcing has been used to distinguish normal retinal images from images with diabetic retinopathy; the collective intelligence of the crowd was able to correctly classify 81% of 230 images (19 unique) for US$1.10/eye in 20min. Crowdsourcing has also been used to distinguish normal optic discs from abnormal ones with reasonable sensitivity (83-88%), but low specificity (35-43%). Another study used crowdsourcing for quick and reliable manual segmentation of optical coherence tomography images. Outside of ophthalmology, crowdsourcing has been used for text and image interpretation, language translation, and data analysis.SummaryCrowdsourcing has the potential for rapid and economical data processing. Among other applications, it could be used in research settings to provide the ground-truth' data, and in the clinical settings to relieve the burden of image processing on experts."
"An experimental-computational method is used to investigate the spectroscopic behavior of naphthalene on the surface of ice grains. UV vis diffuse reflectance and fluorescence spectroscopies of naphthalene combined with DFT and ADC(2) calculations provide evidence for the occurrence of excited-state associates. The measured and calculated bathochromic shifts of the So S, electronic transitions related to naphthalene dimers or naphthalene ice interactions do not exceed 3 nm. The bands observed in the emission spectrum of frozen naphthalene solutions are assigned to excited dimers of different mutual orientations, naphthalene phosphorescence, and fluorescence of anthracene present as a trace impurity and populated by the energy transfer from excited naphthalene. Photochemical reactivity in/on ice and snow is dependent on the absorption properties and speciation of the compounds present in these media. Hence, within this study, we exploit frozen solutions of naphthalene to demonstrate both the absence of considerable bathochromic shift and a strong tendency to aggregate."
"This study provides a general review of Kuwait current treatment and reuse practices of domestic wastewater and focuses on effluent types, quantities of treated and reused water, future plans, challenges, costs, and tariffs, as well as proposing recommendations for better utilization of treated effluent. The study shows that 1Mm(3)/d is generated daily with annual per capita production of 154.6 m(3), which is increasing by 3.6% annually. 75% of all wastewater is treated to mostly RO quality, of which 58% is reused. The chemical and microbiological characteristics of tertiary treated effluent (TTE) and RO permeate (ROP) abide by both Kuwait Environmental public authority (KEPA) and WHO standards. 19% of all water consumed in the agricultural sector is recycled water. 270 K m(3 )of TTE is used for landscape and fodder irrigation but not for edible produce. RO treated effluents of 318 K m(3)/d are utilized for irrigation of crops and natural reserves. Comparisons to water standards indicate that TTE is a better option than ROP for crop irrigation, including vegetables and fruits consumed raw, as it contains essential nutrients that are necessary for plant growth. ROP is best for amities use, injecting depleted aquifers and creating subsurface water reservoirs to provide a strategic reserve for water security requirements. We also recommend that the national standards for treated reclaimed water uses in agriculture need to be adjusted to allow wider reuse of TTE and ROP without harming public health. In addition, more discriminating tests are further needed for WWTP inflow to ensure it adheres to chemical and biological standards to protect bioactivity in aeration tanks and the quality of the effluents."
"Objective: High rates of substance-use disorders (SUD) have been found in samples of adolescents and adults with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Predictors of SUD in children with ADHD who are at risk for the development of SUDs remain understudied. The main aims of this study were to identify clinically meaningful characteristics of children that predicted the future development of SUDs and to see whether the role of these characteristics varied by sex. Method: Subjects were children and adolescents with (n = 268; mean age +/- standard deviation = 10.9 +/- 3.2 years) and without (n = 229; mean age 11.9 +/- 3.3 years) DSM-III-R ADHD followed prospectively and blindly over a 10-year follow-up period onto young adult years. Subjects were assessed with structured diagnostic interviews for psychopathology and SUDs. Results: Over the 10-year follow-up period, ADHD was found to be a significant predictor of any SUD (hazards ratio 1.47; 95% confidence interval 1.07-2.02; p = .01) and cigarette smoking (2.38; 1.61-3.53; p < .01). Within ADHD, comorbid conduct disorder (2.74; 1.66-4.52; p < .01) and oppositional defiant disorder (2.21; 1.40-3.51; p < .01) at baseline were also found to be significant predictors of SUDs. Similar results were found for cigarette-, alcohol-, and drug-use disorders. There were few meaningful sex interaction effects. No clinically significant associations were found for any social or family environment factors or for cognitive functioning factors (p > .05 for all comparisons). Conclusions: These results indicate that ADHD is a significant risk factor for the development of SUDs and cigarette smoking in both sexes. J. Am. Acad. Child Adolesc. Psychiatry, 2011;50(6):543-553."
"Cryopreservation using aluminium cryo-plates was successfully applied to in vitro-grown shoot tips of two Prunus genotypes, cherry plum (Prunus cerasifera Ehrh.) and the plum cultivar 'Pozegaca' (Prunus domestica L.). Shoot tips were dissected from the shoots and precultured for 1 day at 23 degrees C in the dark on Murashige and Skoog medium containing 0.3 M sucrose. The precultured shoot tips were placed on aluminium cryo-plates containing 10 or 12 wells and embedded in alginate gel. Osmoprotection was performed by immersing the cryo-plates in two types of loading solution (LS1 - 2 M glycerol + 0.4 M sucrose or C4 - 1.9 M glycerol + 0.5 M sucrose) for 30 min at room temperature. In the V cryo-plate protocol, dehydration was performed for 30 min at room temperature in a plant vitrification solution containing 37.5% (w/v) glycerol, 15% (w/v) dimethylsulfoxide, 15% (w/v) ethylene glycol and 22.5% (w/v) sucrose. In the D cryo-plate protocol, dehydration was performed by placing the cryo-plates for 2, 2.5 or 3 h under the air current of the laminar flow cabinet or in closed glass containers over silica gel. In both protocols, cooling was performed by placing the cryo-plates in uncapped 2 mL cryotubes, which were immersed in liquid nitrogen. Rewarming was done by direct plunging of cryo-plates in liquid MS medium containing 0.8 M sucrose at room temperature for 30 min (plum cultivar) or 60 min (cherry plum). All experiments were conducted twice in two different laboratories (IRD Montpellier, France and FRI Cgak, Serbia). In the V cryo-plate procedure regrowth (calculated as average values for two laboratories) of cryopreserved shoot tips loaded with C4 solution was 41.7% (cherry plum) and 34.2% (plum cultivar 'Pogegga'), while in those loaded with LS1 solution regrowth was 56.1% and 44.6%, respectively. As for the D cryo-plate procedure, the average regrowth of cryopreserved explants ranged between 57.7% and 77.5% in cherry plum and between 28.5% and 47.5% in plum cultivar 'Pozegaca'. Although during the first subculture after regrowth, the multiplication capacity of cryopreserved explants was lower compared with those originating from dissection controls, by the third subculture they regained and even exceeded the multiplication capacity of shoots regenerated from explants placed on regrowth directly after dissection. The results obtained clearly indicate that both cryopreservation procedures using aluminium cryo-plates can facilitate efficient cryostorage of Prunus germplasm. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

"Jacek Leociak opposes the views whereby representation of the Holocaust is impossible. He takes up certain themes that usually tend to be displaced from humanistic considerations as they are considered to be instances of intellectual necrophilia, if not pathology: these include suffering, horror and dead body. For this author, cognition is a sort of unrestrained propensity exceeding the taboo limits. The reviewer considers whether Leociak's argument is that our contemporary culture proves insensitive to representation of boundary experiences or perhaps it inoculates in the recipient an ethical instinct and triggers a sense of shared responsibility for the past and for the future?"
"GLUT2 is a facilitative glucose transporter, expressed in polarized epithelial cells of the liver, intestine, kidney and pancreas, where it plays a critical role in glucose homeostasis. Together with SGLT1/2, it mediates glucose absorption in metabolic epithelial tissues, where it can be translocated apically upon high glucose exposure. To track the subcellular localization and dynamics of GLUT2, we created an mCherry-hGLUT2 fusion protein and expressed it in multicellular kidney cysts, a major site of glucose reabsorption. Live imaging of GLUT2 enabled us to avoid the artefactual localization of GLUT2 in fixed cells and to confirm the apical GLUT2 model. Live cell imaging showed a rapid 15 +/- 3 min PKC-dependent basal-to-apical translocation of GLUT2 in response to glucose stimulation and a fourfold slower basolateral translocation under starvation. These results mark the physiological importance of responding quickly to rising glucose levels. Importantly, we show that phloretin, an apple polyphenol, inhibits GLUT2 translocation in both directions, suggesting that it exerts its effect by PKC inhibition. Subcellular localization studies demonstrated that GLUT2 is endocytosed through a caveolae-dependent mechanism, and that it is at least partly recovered in Rab11A-positive recycling endosome. Our work illuminates GLUT2 dynamics, providing a platform for drug development for diabetes and hyperglycaemia."
"Commercial hybrids are viable to generate base populations for obtaining new superior lines. Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate the performance and stability of maize topcross hybrids and select superior partly inbred lines. We evaluated 155 topcross hybrids of partly inbred lines crossed with an elite inbred line (tester) together with 14 commercial hybrids (2B688, AG7088, AS1575, DKB390, GNZ2005, GNZ8132, GNZ9501, GNZ9505, GNZ9548, GNZ9623, P30F35, P30F53, P30R50, and Penta) in Guarapuava-PR, Candoi-PR, Guarda-Mor-MG, and Paracatu-MG (Brazil). The assessed variable was grain yield (GY), in kg ha(-1), at 13% moisture, being the plant stand corrected by covariance method. A variance analysis was carried out, testing both stability and adaptability. There were significant differences for all sources of variation. By considering the GY means of the genotypes in each environment, Candoi (10,985 kg ha(-1)) and Paracatu (10,917 kg ha(-1)) were in the first group, while Guarda-Mor (10,448 kg ha(-1)) was allocated in the intermediate group, and Guarapuava (10,159 kg ha(-1)) formed the group of lower GY means. None of the topcrosses stood out in any of the four environments, which may be related to the differences in climate and altitude between environments. Despite of this fact, lines 9, 13, 39, 40, 60, 93, 108, 179, 184, 189, 194, 211, 212, 213, 216, 217, 235, 243, 245, and 253 excelled as promising and should follow the process of inbreeding, in addition to the topcrosses 87, 144, 179, and 211, which also stood out for stability and adaptability in these environments."
"In this paper, a novel low leakage saddle junctionless field effect transistor with assistant gate is proposed. Its electrical properties have been extensively investigated by studying the influence resulting from variation of design parameters, such as the thickness of assistant gate, oxide layer thickness between the main and assistant gate, extension height of S/D contact, and the voltage of assistant gate. Compared with conventional structure, the proposed saddle junctionless field effect transistor with assistant gate shows much better performance at off state. The leakage current is effectively restrained, and the I-on-I-off ratio is largely improved. Design parameter optimization has also been performed."
"The production of enstrophy is strongly coupled to the vortex stretching process that is of inherent importance to the cascading process, one of the driving processes of turbulence in a flow. In this work the enstrophy production mechanism is investigated to identify its variation in the wall-normal direction for the case of a turbulent boundary layer. Production is decomposed into its core quantities including the ratio of the principal strains and the alignment of vorticity with the eigenvectors of the strain rate tensor. The strong variations of these quantities with the wall distance are presented and explained. A self-similar shape of the probability distribution of the enstrophy production is found for regions above the buffer layer. Based on these findings we propose a modification to an existing vortex stretch model that accounts for the wall-normal variation in enstrophy production in a boundary layer. A characteristic decomposition is applied on the turbulence field that allows for the study of the individual production mechanisms of the separate structure types. This analysis reveals a potential backscatter mechanism that transfers kinetic energy from smaller scales towards larger ones, for a structure type described as unstable vortices."
"Water scarcity and economic incentives favor the introduction of upland crops into permanent paddy rice systems during dry seasons. However, introducing upland crops into permanently flooded cropping systems temporarily changes soil conditions from anaerobic to aerobic, affecting nitrogen (N) dynamics profoundly. We hypothesized that under maize and dry rice, total fertilizer N-15 recovery in soil as well as the immobilization of fertilizer N-15 in microbial residues is reduced compared with continuous paddy lice cropping. Furthermore, we expected enhanced emissions of fertilizer N-15 in form of nitrous oxide (N2O) under maize and dry rice. To test these hypotheses, we traced the fate of a N-15-urea pulse in a field experiment in the Philippines with three different crop rotations: continuous paddy rice, paddy rice - dry rice, and paddy rice - maize for two years. Indeed, the N-15 recovery in the first 5 cm of bulk soil was lowest in the paddy rice - maize rotation (arithmetic mean with standard error: 19.2 +/- 1.8% of applied N-15), while twice as much was recovered in the first 5 cm of bulk soil of the continuous paddy rice cropping systems (37.8 +/- 2.2% of applied N-15) during the first dry season. The N-15 recovery in the plant biomass (shoots and roots) in the continuous paddy rice cropping was 13% larger than in the dry rice plant biomass and 5% larger than in the maize plant biomass during the first dry season. Fertilizer N-15 remained longest in paddy rice - maize (mean residence time = 90 +/- 25 days) and in continuous paddy rice (mean residence time = 77 +/- 30 days), compared with thy rice - paddy rice rotation (mean residence time = 16 +/- 5 days). After 2 years, 10% (paddy rice - dry rice, paddy rice - maize) to 23% (continuous paddy rice) of the applied fertilizer N-15 were still stored in soil. The largest fraction of this N-15 was immobilized by soil microbes, which stored 3-4% of applied N-15 in the form of amino sugars as specific cell wall constituents, in all cropping systems. Nevertheless, introducing upland crops into continuous paddy rice systems likely increased N leaching losses and resulted in initial losses of urea- N-15 to N2O, which thus has to be considered in climate smart mitigation strategies."

"Reactive oxygen and nitrogen species have been implicated in diverse pathophysiological conditions, including inflammation, neurodegenerative diseases and cancer. Accumulating evidence indicates that oxidative damage to biomolecules including lipids, proteins and DNA, contributes to these diseases. Previous studies suggest roles of lipid peroxidation and oxysterols in the development of neurodegenerative diseases and inflammation-related cancer. Our recent studies identifying and characterizing carbonylated proteins reveal oxidative damage to heat shock proteins in neurodegenerative disease models and inflammation-related cancer, suggesting dysfunction in their antioxidative properties. In neurodegenerative diseases, DNA damage may not only play a role in the induction of apoptosis, but also may inhibit cellular division via telomere shortening. Immunohistochemical analyses showed co-localization of oxidative/ nitrative DNA lesions and stemness markers in the cells of inflammation-related cancers. Here, we review oxidative stress and its significant roles in neurodegenerative diseases and cancer."
"Leaching and oxidation of high arsenic (As) host rocks tend to be induced by circulation of deep geothermal waters, which increase As concentration in shallow groundwater. The purpose of this study is to identify the mechanism of groundwater As contamination in relation to leaching and oxidation along the border between the South Minahasa and Bolaang Mongondow districts, North Sulawesi, Indonesia. This region contains Miocene sedimentary rock-hosted disseminated gold deposits associated with hydrothermal alteration in a fault zone. Abnormally high As concentrations were observed in hot and cold springs and in surrounding shallow groundwater for a total mineralization area of 8 x 10 km(2). Two methods were adopted in this study: (1) microscopic and spectroscopic analyses of rock samples for mineral identification and (2) geostatistics for spatial modeling of As concentrations in groundwater. Jarosite was identified as the chief fill mineral in rock defects (cracks and pores). The presence of this mineral may indicate release of As into the environment, as can occur as an alteration product derived from oxidation and leaching of pyrite, As-rich pyrite or sulfide minerals by geothermal waters. Moreover, As concentrations in groundwater were estimated using geostatistics for spatial modeling. The co-kriging map identified local anomalies in groundwater As concentrations over the permissible limit (10 ppb). Such anomalies did not appear through ordinary kriging. Integration of the results indicates that As contamination in shallow groundwater probably is controlled by heterogeneous distributions of jarosite and variations in intensity and extent of hydrothermal activities."
"Prokaryota in natural environments form biofilms, which are benthic assemblages of a variety of microorganisms embedded within their extracellular mucilage. Biofilms are firmly attached to surfaces such as aquatic sediments. Quorum sensing by the many microbes in a biofilm is collective decision making and cooperation for responding to internal and external parameters affecting the community. This communication is based on chemical signaling affecting gene expression of the microorganisms. Microorganisms situated in a biofilm change behaviors and metabolic activities to comply with the requirements of the entire biofilm cooperative. Consequently, reconstruction of the evolution of prokaryotes in Earth history must consider the biofilm way of microbial life. Biogenic sedimentary structures might not represent certain microbial groups, but in fact may be relics of modified cooperative microbial activities. Future research should focus on detectable biosignatures caused by biofilm consortia as a whole instead of on the appearance or extinction of individual microbial groups. Such sedimentary structures as stromatolites and microbially induced sedimentary structures (MISS) are intrinsically controlled by biofilms, but also affected by extrinsic (environmental) conditions."
"A combined AFM/MS method was employed for protein registration in solution. This method is based on reversible specific capturing of a target protein from a large volume of analyzed solution onto a small sensor area of a chip with immobilized aptamer ligands. Fishing of the core antigen of hepatitis C virus (HCVcoreAg) from 10(-12) M solution of this protein in buffer was carried out. It has been shown that the AFM/MS method allows the detection of HCVcoreAg in the form of a protein conjugate as well as in the presence of protein matrix (components of human serum). At the first stage, aptamer/antigen complexes were AFM-registered on the chip surface after its incubation in 10(-12) M solution of antigen in buffer. A technique for the analysis was developed, and criteria for the evaluation of AFM analysis data based on the counting of the aptamer/antigen complexes were proposed. At the second stage, the mass spectrometric identification of protein objects on the chip surface was accomplished; this allowed the reliable identification of the target protein (the core antigen of hepatitis C virus, HCVcoreAg) and confirmed the AFM analysis data."
"Personalization is an upcoming trend in gamification research, with several researchers proposing that gamified systems should take personal characteristics into account. However, creating good gamified designs is effort intensive as it is and tailoring system interactions to each user will only add to this workload. We propose machine learning algorithm -based personalized content selection to address a part of this problem and present a process for creating personalized designs that allows automating a part of the implementation. The process is based on Deterding's 2015 framework for gameful design, the lens of intrinsic skill atoms, with additional steps for selecting a personalization strategy and algorithm creation. We then demonstrate the process by implementing personalized gamification for a computer-supported collaborative learning environment. For this demonstration, we use the gamification user type hexad for personalization and the heuristics for effective design of gamification for overall design. The result of the applied design process is a context-aware, personalized gamification ruleset for collaborative environments. Lastly, we present a method for translating gamification rulesets to machine-readable classifier algorithm using the CN2 rule inducer."
"Background: Quality assurance has become an important issue. Many societies are adopting quality assurance programs in order to monitor and improve quality of care. Aim: To assess the opinion of gastroenterologists towards quality assurance on the endoscopy department. Methods: A survey was sent to all gastroenterologists (n = 319)in the Netherlands. It assessed their opinion on a quality assurance program for endoscopy units, including its design, logistics, and content. Results: 200 gastroenterologists (63%) completed the questionnaire. 95% had a positive opinion towards quality assurance and 67% supposed an increase in quality. 28% assumed a negative impact on the time available for patient contact by introducing a quality assurance program and 35% that the capacity would decrease. A negative attitude towards disclosure of results to insurance companies (23%) and media (53%) was reported. Female gastroenterologists were less positive to share the results with other stakeholders (p < 0.05). Most important quality measurements were assessment of complications (97%), standardised reporting (96%), and adequate patient information (95%). Conclusion: Gastroenterologists have a positive attitude towards quality assurance. However, concerns do exist about time investment and disclosure of results to others. Information provision and procedure characteristics were considered the most important aspects of quality assurance. (C) 2010 Editrice Gastroenterologica Italiana S.r.l. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

"Contact area is an important geometric measurement in many physical systems. It is also difficult to compute due to its extreme sensitivity to infinitesimal perturbations. In this paper, we propose a new concept called an effective contact measure, which acts as a smooth version of contact area. Effective contact measures incorporate a notion of scale into the definition of contact area, allowing one to consider the degree of contact at different sizes. We show how effective contact measures can yield useful statistics for a number of applications, including analysis of multiphase materials and docking/alignment problems. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

"Microrod arrays of zinc oxide with copper have been grown by chemical vapor deposition on single-crystal sapphire substrates preliminarily covered with a nanoscale copper layer. The presence of copper (about 0.3%) in zinc-oxide microrods has been experimentally shown to increase the photoluminescence intensity of the ZnO microcrystal arrays, reduce the lasing threshold, and lead to a small (by similar to 2.5 nm) blue shift of the radiation intensity peak of the ZnO microcrystals. It is shown that the laser-radiation character depends on the morphology of the ZnO microrod arrays."
"Variable rate irrigation (VRI) can increase water use efficiency and productivity by applying water based on site-specific needs. In this study, the performance of a five-span centre-pivot irrigation system (CPIS) retrofitted with a commercial variable-rate irrigation package was evaluated at constant and variable application depths at the Alberta Irrigation Technology Centre (AITC) in southern Alberta, Canada. Two sets of experiments were designed to investigate the uniformity of application of the system during the 2013 and 2014 growing seasons. The first set of catch-can trials were carried out with three irrigation rates in the direction of pivot travel. Three different wind regimes were observed during the catch-can trials. Catch-cans were arranged in grid configurations within the experimental plots located under one irrigation zone in span 4. The Christiansen coefficient of uniformity (CU) ranged from 90.4 to 94.4%. Wind speeds of 3.3 and 6.5m s(-1) negatively and significantly impacted the CU values. The second set of catch-can trials were performed with used and new sprinklers in a transect along the pivot lateral during the 2014 growing season. The Heermann and Hein coefficient of uniformity (CUHH) ranged from 89.0 to 93.5% and from 81.7 to 94.4% with constant and variable application depths, respectively. The greatest (94.4%) and least (81.7%) CUHH values were observed where water applications were 100 and 40% of the set point, respectively. Overall, the uniformity of application of CPIS retrofitted with the commercial VRI package both along the system's lateral and in the travel direction were above 90% for the majority of the trials under the different wind speeds and water application depths.

"BACKGROUND: Although there have been some reports regarding body mass index (BMI) and subtypes of stroke, there have been few concerning the relationship between BMI and location of spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH). Determining the location of spontaneous ICH is important because outcome is thought to be affected by its location. The aim of this study was to determine whether location of spontaneous ICH varied according to BMI level. METHODS: In this retrospective study, 463 patients with spontaneous ICH were divided into 3 groups according to BMI (kg/m(2)): <18.5 (underweight), 18.5 to 24.0 (normal weight), 24.0 to 29 (overweight), and >29.0 (obesity). We compared the clinical characteristics among patients with putaminal, thalamic, lobar, pontine, or cerebellar hemorrhage on univariate and multinominal logistic regression analysis. RESULTS: Among the 5 locations, BMI level was lowest in patients with lobar hemorrhage and highest in those with pontine hemorrhage. Compared to patients with nonlobar hemorrhage, patients with lobar hemorrhage showed a higher proportion of individuals who were underweight, female, and age >70 years and a lower proportion who were hypertensive. Compared with patients with nonpontine hemorrhage, those with pontine hemorrhage showed a higher proportion of individuals who were obese. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicate that BMI can affect the location of spontaneous ICH."
"We report for the first time the synthesis of CdSe@Fe2O3 core/shell nanoparticles by a one-step seeded-growth approach. These nanoparticles not only retain their individual semiconducting and magnetic functionalties, but also exhibit some new properties which are affected by the coating components. These bifunctional CdSe@Fe2O3 nanoparticles might find potential applications in biosensing and in biomedical research."
"The co-occurrence of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) with heavy metals (HMs) is very common in contaminated soils, but the influence of HMs on fungal-bacterial synergism during PAH bioremediation has not been investigated. The bioremediation of fluoranthene-contaminated sand using co-cultures of Acremonium sp. P0997 and Bacillus subtilis showed increases of 109.4 and 9.8 % in degradation compared to pure bacterial and fungal cultures, respectively, removing 64.1 +/- 1.4 % fluoanthene in total. The presence of Cu2+ reduced fluoranthene removal to 53.7 +/- 1.7 %, while inhibiting bacterial growth, and reducing translocation of bacteria on fungal hyphae by 49.5 %, in terms of the bacterial translocation ratio. Cu2+ reduced bacterial diffusion by 46.8 and 31.9 %, as reflected by D (a bulk random motility diffusional coefficient) and D (eff) (the effective one-dimensional diffusion coefficient) compared to the control without HM supplementation, respectively. However, Mn2+ resulted in a 78.2 +/- 1.9 % fluoranthene degradation, representing an increase of 21.9 %, while enhancing bacterial growth and bacterial translocation on fungal hyphae, showing a 12.0 % increase in translocation ratio, with no observable impact on D and D (eff). Hence, the presence of HMs has been shown to affect fungal-bacterial synergism in PAH degradation, and this effect differs with HM species."
"The mechanism of action of tastants has been under investigation for many years. For the sweet taste several models have been developed to describe the nature and topological arrangement of the glucophores of ideal sweet compounds and/or the recognition sites of the sweet taste receptor. In less than a decade our knowledge about the mechanism of sweet taste chemoreception has grown enormously, following the identification and cloning of T1Rs. The observation that receptor cells co-expressing T1R2 and T1R3 respond to a great variety of sweet compounds has been generally interpreted as an inference that there is a single heterodimeric receptor for sweet taste. The three-dimensional structure of the receptor is not known and alternative methodologies are required to model the binding of sweet compounds. Therefore homology modelling and molecular modelling become indispensable tools to suggest point mutations which further define the binding regions. Only their cooperative effect allowed researchers to determine several molecular mechanisms of the sweet taste receptors, including the modality of action of blockers and positive allosteric modulators. For umami taste, despite the general appreciation of the meaty, mouth filling and rich taste found in many foods (and the great interest of the food industry thereof), the existence of an umami receptor has been accepted only after its cloning. Probably because of this, no umami taste receptor models have been developed, while the molecular mechanism for its synergism has been unravelled before that of the sweet taste receptor.

"We investigate the structure of global inter-firm linkages using a dataset that contains information on business partners for about 400,000 firms worldwide, including all the firms listed on the major stock exchanges. Among the firms, we examine three networks, which are based on customer-supplier, licensee-licensor, and strategic alliance relationships. First, we show that these networks all have scale-free topology and that the degree distribution for each follows a power law with an exponent of 1.5. The shortest path length is around six for all three networks. Second, we show through community structure analysis that the firms comprise a community with those firms that belong to the same industry but different home countries, indicating the globalization of firms' production activities. Finally, we discuss what such production globalization implies for the proliferation of conflict minerals (i.e., minerals extracted from conflict zones and sold to firms in other countries to perpetuate fighting) through global buyer-supplier linkages. We show that a limited number of firms belonging to some specific industries and countries plays an important role in the global proliferation of conflict minerals. Our numerical simulation shows that regulations on the purchases of conflict minerals by those firms would substantially reduce their worldwide use."
"The International Society of Urological Pathology (ISUP) held an expert-driven penile cancer conference in Boston in March 2015, which focused on the new World Health Organisation (WHO) classification of penile cancer: human papillomavirus (HPV)-related tumours and histological grading. The conference was preceded by an online survey of the ISUP members, and the results were used to initiate discussions. Because of the rarity of penile tumours, this was not a consensus but an expert-driven conference aimed at assisting pathologists who do not see these tumours on a regular basis. After a justification for the novel separation of penile squamous cell carcinomas into HPV-related and non-HPV-related-carcinomas, the histological classification of penile carcinoma was proposed; this system was also accepted subsequently by the WHO for subtyping of penile carcinomas (2016). A description of HPV-related neoplasms, which may be recognised by their histological features, was presented, and p16 was recommended as a surrogate indicator of HPV. A three-tier grading system was recommended for penile squamous carcinomas; this was also adopted by the WHO (2016). Many of the distinctive histological subtypes of squamous cell carcinoma of the penis are associated with distinct grades, based on the squamous cell carcinoma subtype histological features."
"The study of post-extinction recovery effects in humans has received significant attention. For instance, research on reinstatement has increased in the last decade. However, most of the studies focus on the return of fear responses. In the present experiments, we used a videogame task to explore the reinstatement of operant behavior in human participants. In Experiment 1, after participants learned to shoot at enemies, they received an extinction procedure that eliminated the shooting behavior. However, the mere reintroduction of the outcome reinstated the original response. Experiment 2 showed that the reinstatement of instrumental behavior is contextually modulated. Finally, in Experiment 3 we found that presenting a reminder for extinction attenuated the response recovery effect. The overall pattern of results suggests that reinstatement of voluntary actions in humans could be explained by an interference memory framework. In addition, the present data suggest that therapies that use brief reminders of therapeutic intervention could help prevent the reinstatement of unhealthy instrumental behaviors."
"Classical Hodgkin lymphoma (cHL), although originating from B cells, is characterized by the virtual lack of gene products whose expression constitutes the B-cell phenotype. Epigenetic repression of B-cell-specific genes via promoter hypermethylation and histone deacetylation as well as compromised expression of B-cell-committed transcription factors were previously reported to contribute to the lost B-cell phenotype in cHL. Restoring the B-cell phenotype may not only correct a central malignant property, but it may also render cHL susceptible to clinically established antibody therapies targeting B-cell surface receptors or small compounds interfering with B-cell receptor signaling. We conducted a high-throughput pharmacological screening based on>28 000 compounds in cHL cell lines carrying a CD19 reporter to identify drugs that promote reexpression of the B-cell phenotype. Three chemicals were retrieved that robustly enhanced CD19 transcription. Subsequent chromatin immunoprecipitation-based analyses indicated that action of 2 of these compounds was associated with lowered levels of the transcriptionally repressive lysine 9-trimethylated histone H3 mark at the CD19 promoter. Moreover, the antileukemia agents all-trans retinoic acid and arsenic trioxide (ATO) were found to reconstitute the silenced B-cell transcriptional program and reduce viability of cHL cell lines. When applied in combination with a screening-identified chemical, ATO evoked reexpression of the CD20 antigen, which could be further therapeutically exploited by enabling CD20 antibodymediated apoptosis of cHL cells. Furthermore, restoration of the B-cell phenotype also rendered cHL cells susceptible to the B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma-tailored small-compound inhibitors ibrutinib and idelalisib. In essence, we report here a conceptually novel, redifferentiation-based treatment strategy for cHL. (Blood. 2017;129(1):71-81)"
"Goals: To investigate if the stair negotiation by older people during activities of daily life (ADL) can be accurately identified using a freely worn pendant device. To investigate how usual stair-ascent performances during ADL relate to clinical assessments and prospective falls. Methods: ADL were recorded for 30 min by 52 community-dwelling older people (83 +/- 4 years) using a small pendant device. Classification accuracy was assessed using annotated video and four-fold cross validation. Correlations between sensor-derived stair-ascent features (comprising intensity, variability, and stability) and a battery of clinical tests (comprising physiological, psychological, health, and follow-up falls) were investigated. Results: Accurate identification of stair events (99.8%, Kappa 0.92) was possible in both ""frail"" and ""athletic"" participants by scaling the barometer threshold to stair cadences. Cautious double-stepping strategy could be identified remotely. Stair-ascent performance was correlated with ascent strategy (r = -0.67), age (r = -0.44), concern about falling (r = -0.43), fall-risk scores (r = -0.41), processing speed (r = -0.38), and contrast sensitivity (r = 0.32). Follow-up falls were correlated with ascent stability (r = -0.35). Conclusion: Remote analysis of stair ascents is feasible. In our healthy older people, outcomes appeared more related to mental rather than physiological factors. The ascent strategies we observed in some older people may have reflected an appropriate behavioral response to increased concerns about falling. Significance: Given acceptance of wearable devices is increasing; reduced functional performance and altered strategies for undertaking ADL could soon be routinely tracked to augment health care."
"HEMA, MMA, NVP, EDGMA, and 3-vinylanisole were copolymerized with Si nanoparticles and silicon 2,3-naphthalocyanine bis (trihexylsilyloxide) for ophthalmic application. The physical, optical, and surface characteristics of the contact lens copolymers were investigated to examine the usefulness of the above nanomaterials as components for contact lenses. The water content and the refractive index were in the range of 26.03-37.61% and 1.435-1.479, respectively. Meanwhile, the tensile strength ranging from 0.156 to 0.802 kgf increased with increasing the addition ratio of 3-vinylanisole. Si nanoparticles reduce spectral transmittance in all wavelengths, whereas for silicon 2,3-naphthalocyanine bis (trihexylsilyloxide) the transmittance of visual light increased but the transmittance of UV and near infrared decreased. High contact angle was observed for contact lenses containing both Si nanopowder and silicon 2,3-naphthalocyanine bis (trihexylsilyloxide). The water content of contact lenses was not significantly affected by the addition of 3-vinylanisole. Nanomaterials such as Si nanoparticles and silicon 2,3-naphthalocyanine bis (trihexylsilyloxide) can be used for manufacturing hydrogel soft contact lenses with UV-blocking capabilities if the intensity and the wettability of the surface are properly controlled."
"We evaluated home-range size and site tenacity of Le Conte's Sparrows (Ammodramus lecontii) during winter 2002-2003 at Brazoria National Wildlife Refuge, Texas. Twenty-six wintering Le Conte's Sparrows were radiomarked in 1- and 2-year post-burn units, and monitored for similar to 10 days. Additionally, 1-ha plots on each 1-, 2- and 3-year (n = 15) post-burn units were flush-netted once monthly. Telemetry results indicated Le Conte's Sparrows were sedentary during winter with a 50% probability mean home-range of 2.41 ha (72% < 1 ha) and a 95% probability mean home range of 10.31 ha (44% < 1 ha and 55% < 1.5 ha). Home-range size did not differ between post-burn year 1 and 2 (P = 0.227). Le Conte's Sparrows appeared to exhibit a behavioral response to flush-netting (P < 0.001) with estimated capture probability of 0.462 and recapture probability of 0.056. Our findings suggest Le Conte's Sparrows remain fairly sedentary throughout the winter. Received 28 March 2008. Accepted 7 August 2009."
"Direct numerical simulations are conducted for regular or structured porous media represented by packed beds of spheres enclosed in square cross-section channels for different channel-to-sphere diameter ratios (D(s/)d(p) = 1 to infinity) using hybrid finite element/volume (FE/FV) methods. The hybrid flow solver methodology is based on the pressure correction or projection method, which involves a fractional step approach to obtain an intermediate velocity field by solving the original momentum equations with the matrix-free, implicit, cell-centered finite volume method. The Poisson equation resulting from the fractional step approach is then solved by node based Galerkin finite element method for an auxiliary variable which is closely related to pressure and is used to update the velocity field and pressure field. The hybrid flow solver has been extended for applications in structured packed beds for both infinite and also wall bounded porous media. The packed spheres representing the porous media are shrunk by 2% d(p) so that there is a finite, but very small spacing between spheres and also between sphere and wall to avoid highly skewed elements. Studies are conducted to test our novel hybrid FE/FV solver for porous media flows and also to analyze wall effects in detail for regular, structured porous media in Simple Cubic (SC) configuration. Three dimensional numerical simulations are conducted for different channel to sphere diameter ratios (D-s/d(p)) and also for infinite porous media over wide range of Reynolds numbers (I <= Re-E <= 5000) so that the dimensionless pressure drop or friction factor dependence on the Reynolds number and D-s/d(p) ratio is clearly understood. Results are validated with available empirical correlations and experimental data. Friction factor correlations for random beds are suitable for structured beds only at very low Reynolds numbers (Re-E <= 20), but deviate significantly beyond that due to the channeling present in regular porous media which becomes increasingly significant at higher Reynolds numbers. For structured beds, wall influence was observed to be significant on the friction factor calculation in both laminar and turbulent regimes. Compared to infinite beds, friction factors increased as the channel-tosphere diameter ratio (D-s/d(p)) decreased in the entire flow regime. This is unlike the behavior for random porous media where walls have contrasting effects at lower and higher Reynolds numbers when compared to the infinite random beds. Dimensionless pressure drop and friction factor results obtained from our simulations for a wide range of Re-E and D(s/)d(p) are curve-fitted to provide generalized correlations for predicting the friction factors in Simple Cubic (SC) structured packed beds.

"In this paper we investigate consumers' emotional responses to food packaging. More specifically, we use self-report and physiological measures to jointly assess emotional responses to three typical food packaging elements: colours (low-wavelength vs. high-wavelength), images (positive vs. negative) and typefaces (simple vs. ornate). A sample of 120 participants was exposed to mock package design concepts of chocolate blocks. The results suggest that images generate an emotional response that can be measured by both self-report and physiological measures, whereas colours and typefaces generate emotional response that can only be measured by self-report measures. We propose that a joint application of self-report and physiological measures can lead to richer information and wider interpretation of consumer emotional responses to food packaging elements than using either measure alone.

"A platinum electrode modified with natural phosphate (NP) was evaluated as an electro-chemical sensor for diquat (DQ) in aqueous medium. The electrode was prepared by the deposition of natural phosphate on the platinum surface. Diquat was preconcentrated on the surface of the modified electrode by adsorbing with natural phosphate and reduced at a negative potential in 0.1 M K2SO4 solution. The influence of accumulation time and pH of the electrolytic solution were investigated. The calibration graph obtained under the optimized conditions was linear with a correlation coefficient of 0.9813 at levels near the detection limits up to at least 5.32 x 10(-9) mol L-1 with the relative standard deviation (RSD) lower than 3.37%. Interferences by some metals were investigated. Fe, Zn, Cu, MnO4 and Hg apparently affected the peak currents P-1 and P-2 of diquat. The natural phosphate modified platinum electrode was applied to the determination of diquat in natural water samples. The results indicate that this electrode is sensitive and effective for the determination of diquat. (C) 2012 Production and hosting by Elsevier B.V."
"Composites of Al-Si-Mg (A356) alloy with silicon carbide particles were synthesized in-house and foamed by melt processing using titanium hydride as foaming agent. The effects of the SiCP size and content, and foaming temperature on the stability and quality of the foam were explored. It was observed that the foam stability depended on the foaming temperature alone but not on the particle size or volume percent within the studied ranges. Specifically, foam stability was poor at 670A degrees C. Among the stable foams obtained at 640A degrees C, cell soundness (absence of/low defects, and collapse) was seen to vary depending on the particle size and content; For example, for finer size, lower particle contents were sufficient to obtain sound cell structure. It is possible to determine a foaming process window based on material and process parameters for good expansion, foam stability, and cell structure."
"To explore and research the characteristics of the space-based and ground-based electromagnetic observational data and the correlation between them has important scientific significance for integrating satellite and ground electromagnetic monitoring data used in earthquake monitoring and research. In the paper, the near DC electromagnetic data recorded in DEMETER satellite, vertical and horizontal geoelectric field data recorded in Hongshawan station and horizontal geoelectric field data recorded in Chengdu station were comprehensively studied. The results showed that: (1) The ULF electric field observational data recorded directly by the DEMETER satellite did not show significant annual change trends; the observational data along the velocity vector direction both day side and night side present a longer-term cyclical characteristic, but there are no correlation and synchronization with geoelectric field observational data. (2)The magnitude of electric field data in ionosphere after removing the additional electric field value caused by satellite cutting magnetic line is consistent with geoelectric field data, and concentrated at about 10(-1) similar to 10(-2) mV/m. (3) The concave annual seasonal change trend is displayed by the observation data along the normal to the orbit direction and along the velocity vector direction in night side, and showing a relatively stable annual variation period, this is consistent with the trend of the annual variation of the horizontal geoelectric field. Therefore, both the magnitude and trends have shown the correlation and synchronization every year."
"The aim of this paper is to derive methodology for designing 'time to event' type experiments. In comparison to estimation, design aspects of 'time to event' experiments have received relatively little attention. We show that gains in efficiency of estimators of parameters and use of experimental material can be made using optimal design theory. The types of models considered include classical failure data and accelerated testing situations, and frailty models, each involving covariates which influence the outcome. The objective is to construct an optimal design based of the values of the covariates and associated model or indeed a candidate set of models. We consider D-optimality and create compound optimality criteria to derive optimal designs for multi-objective situations which, for example, focus on the number of failures as well as the estimation of parameters. The approach is motivated and demonstrated using common failure/survival models, for example, the Weibull distribution, product assessment and frailty models."
In this paper we analyse the upward earthquake hypocentral migration in the ten known subduction zones and discuss a possible mechanism of such migration. The total time of the migration appears to range from 2.5 to 10 years. It leads to the estimation of the average velocity V-z similar to 60 - 300 km yr(-1). It probably corresponds to the movement of the forcing agent like stress or deformation wave from depths of the upper mantle (600-700km) to the level of the lithosphere with subsequent initiation of fluid migration inside the crust to trigger shallow earthquakes. Averaged over all zones upward migration travel time is about 5 years (< V-z >approximate to 120 km yr(-1)) that coincides approximately with the period of characteristic temperature variation (El Nino) and crustal seismic periodicity in the Pacific region. These findings are helpful for the study of the seismic precursors and analysis of earthquake triggering.
"Ambrym is one of the most actively erupting basaltic volcanoes in the Vanuatu island arc. Scoria clasts collected from a fallout deposit in the inner terrace of its Benbow active crater were analyzed through series of synchrotron X-ray computed microtomographic experiments, as well as permeability measurements and simulations. Our goal was to reconstruct and visualize scoria textures in 3D and to quantify vesicularity, permeability, vesicle sizes and distributions in order to understand how gas moves in and out of Ambrym basaltic magma. We find that vesicle size distributions in the volume range between similar to 10(3) and 10(10) mu m(3) define two scoria classes. Vesicle size distributions in the low-to-moderately (0.44-0.67) vesicular samples can be fit by power laws with an exponent of 1 +/- 0.2; distributions in the highly vesicular (0.86-0.88) samples can be fit by power laws with a higher exponent (1.4 to 1.7), as well as by exponential fits. Highly vesicular samples exhibit a very pronounced large vesicle, consisting of networks of smaller, interconnected vesicles, that is more than three orders of magnitude larger in volume than all other vesicles in each distribution. This type of vesicle is not found in the low-to-moderately vesicular samples. In addition, vesicle number density negatively correlates with vesicularity: less vesicular samples have the highest number density and vice versa, and contain far more numerous small-to-medium-sized vesicles than highly vesicular samples. Measured and calculated viscous (Darcian) permeabilities overlap in the range 10(-13) and 10(-9) m(2), with higher values in the more vesicular samples. We ascribe these differences in the textural and physical properties of the scoria clasts to their derivation from distinct magma portions in the conduit that were driven by convective overturn and underwent different vesiculation histories and gas transport dynamics. Comparing basaltic scoria clasts from Ambrym to those from mild explosive activity at Stromboli volcano (Italy) reveals that differences in their vesicle size distributions may result from the influence of different crystal contents and shapes on the vesiculation and permeability of the respective magmas. Finally, we highlight how rheological properties have a fundamental role in determining the degassing behaviour of basaltic magma at Ambrym and other volcanoes in general. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

"The high energy demand and CO2 emissions in the road transport sector in Indonesia are mainly caused by the use of passenger cars. This situation is predicted to continue due to the increase in car ownership. Scenarios are arranged to examine the potential reductions in energy demand and CO2 emissions in comparison with the business as usual (BAU) condition between 2016 and 2050 by controlling car intensity (fuel economy) and activity (vehicle-km). The intensity is controlled through the introduction of new car technologies, while the activity is controlled through the enactment of fuel taxes. This study aims to analyze the energy demand and CO2 emissions of passenger cars in Indonesia not only for a period in the past (2010-2015) but also based on projections through to 2050, by employing a provincially disaggregated bottom-up model. The provincially disaggregated model shows more accurate estimations for passenger car energy demands. The results suggest that energy demand and CO2 emissions in 2050 will be 50 million liter gasoline equivalent (LGE) and 110 million tons of CO2, respectively. The five provinces with the highest CO2 emissions in 2050 are projected to be West Java, Banten, East Java, Central Java, and South Sulawesi. The projected analysis for 2050 shows that new car technology and fuel tax scenarios can reduce energy demand from the BAU condition by 7.72% and 3.18% and CO2 emissions by 15.96% and 3.18%, respectively."
"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE High-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) is an inflammatory marker associated with subsequent coronary events and neointimal hyperplasia after coronary artery stent placement. We sought to determine if elevated levels of hsCRP are associated with restenosis after placement of extra-and intracranial stents. METHODS We retrospectively reviewed 73 consecutive patients at Michigan State University from July 2006 until June 2007 who underwent treatment with carotid artery stent placement or intracranial stent placement. Data were collected in regards to demographics, pre-procedural hsCRP, and LDL levels, and angiographic variables characterizing the lesion before and after treatment. A binary logistic regression model was constructed to determine independent predictors of restenosis. RESULTS A total of 73 patients with a mean age of 69 +/- 11 years were studied. A total of 57 patients were treated with extracranial carotid stenting, 22 (38%) of whom were symptomatic, while 16 patients underwent intracranial stenting (all were symptomatic). There were 9 patients (4 intracranial stents [25%] and 5 carotid stents [8.8%]) who developed a restenosis of >50%. In binary logistic regression modeling, the following variables were found to be independently predictive of developing restenosis: smaller vessel diameter (OR .49, 95% CI .23-.98, P-value .046) and elevated hsCRP (OR 2.2, 95% CI 1.29-6.66, P-value .018). CONCLUSIONS Elevated levels of pre-procedural hsCRP may be predictive of the development of neointimal hyperplasia in patients treated with extra-or intracranial stenting procedures. Future prospective multicenter studies will be required to confirm these findings."
"Background: Terlipressin is used as pharmacological treatment for variceal bleeding. The drug's physiological effect favours hyponatremia, and rapid changes in plasma sodium (PNa) may cause brain injury. Cirrhosis patients seem to be largely protected against this effect but patients without cirrhosis may not be so. Objective: The objective of this study was to examine whether terlipressin treatment of patients without cirrhosis leads to more serious fluctuations in PNa than in cirrhosis. Methods: In a retrospective cohort design, during a 39-month period, 11 patients with prehepatic portal hypertension and no cirrhosis and 134 patients with cirrhosis received a minimum cumulative terlipressin dose of 4mg during at least 24 hours for variceal bleeding. The groups' PNa changes were compared. Results: During terlipressin, the non-cirrhotic patients developed a greater reduction in PNa [mean 8.3 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.9-14.6) vs. 1.8 (1.0-2.7) mmol/l; p = 0.048], a lower nadir PNa [129 (123-135) vs. 133 (132-134) mmol/l; p = 0.06], and within 48 hours after terlipressin a greater increase in PNa [12.6 (3.4-21.7) vs. 2.3 (1.5-3.0) mmol/l; p = 0.03]. Severe (>10 mmol/l change) hyponatriemia or PNa rebound were seen in 27% of these patients but in only 4% of those with cirrhosis (p = 0.02). One non-cirrhotic patient developed permanent brain damage. Conclusion: Terlipressin treatment of bleeding varices carries a high risk of potentially dangerous PNa fluctuations in patients with non-cirrhotic prehepatic portal hypertension."
"The effect of ploughing depth and mechanical soil loading on the performance of pea sole crops, oat sole crops and pea-oat intercrops was investigated in field experiments under organic farming conditions at two sites in Germany in 2009 and 2010. The two ploughing depths were short-term shallow ploughing to a soil depth of 7-10 cm and deep ploughing to 25-30 cm. Wheel loads of 26 and 45 kN, which correspond to typical rear wheel loads of field machinery used during sowing operations, were compared to an uncompacted control. Shallow ploughing resulted in a greater penetration resistance in the 14-28 cm soil layer compared to deep ploughing. An increase in mechanical soil loading intensity increased the bulk density and decreased the air capacity in the 10-15 cm soil layer, whereas the penetration resistance was not affected. The annual weed infestation in pea sole crops was higher after shallow than after deep ploughing at both sites. Pea-oat intercrops compensated for the higher weed infestation after shallow ploughing at one site due to their excellent weed suppressive ability. Dependent on oat productivity, pea-oat intercrops produced comparable or higher grain and protein yields than pea sole crops. Intercropped pea yield components and grain protein yields were significantly lower than those of sole cropped peas. The ploughing depth did not affect pea grain yields in either year and oat yields in 2009. Due to a better emergence, the grain and protein yield of sole and intercropped oats were significantly higher after shallow ploughing in 2010. Mechanical soil loading did not have any effect on the yield performance of pea sole crops, oat sole crops and pea-oat intercrops in 2009. In 2010, mechanical soil loading of 26 kN and 45 kN decreased the pea grain yield by 12.1% and 20.8% respectively, regardless of sole or intercropped. Neither the grain yield nor the grain quality of sole and intercropped oats was affected by the mechanical soil loading in 2010. Grain and crude protein yields of total crop stands decreased with increasing mechanical soil loading after deep ploughing, whereas no significant differences were revealed after shallow ploughing. The present study confirms the positive qualities of pea-oat intercrops with regard to weed suppression and plant performance. Shallow ploughing mitigates the risk of a decrease in crop performance caused by heavy field traffic and provides an alternative to deep ploughing even in low weed competitive organically farmed grain legumes.

"Objective: To evaluate the effect of preimplantation genetic screening (PGS) on morphologic outcome in children. Design: Follow-up of a randomized controlled trial (RCT). Setting: University hospital. Patient(s): Two-year-old children born to mothers who participated in an RCT on the efficacy of PGS: 50 children born after in vitro fertilization (IVF)/intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) with PGS (intervention group; PGS+) and 72 children born after IVF/ICSI only (control group; PGS-). Sixty-six age-matched children conceived without any form of assisted reproduction were recruited separately in a local public health service center (reference group). Intervention(s): PGS. Main Outcome Measure(s): Body surface examination and anthropometry. The evaluation of morphologic abnormalities allowed assessment of children's phenotype in detail. Morphologic abnormalities were classified as major abnormalities (abnormal development in organogenesis, deformations, disruptions, or dysplasia) and minor anomalies (deviations in phenogenesis). Result(s): The percentage of children with >= 1 major abnormality was 28% in the PGS+ and 35% in the PGS - group [difference - 7%, 95% CI - 23% to 10%]. The percentage of children with >= 1 minor anomaly was 64% in the PGS+ and 67% in the PGS - group [difference - 3%, 95% CI - 15% to 20%]. In the reference group 30% of the children had >= 1 major abnormality [95% CI 20% to 43%] and 74% had >= 1 minor anomaly [95% CI 62% to 84%]. Conclusion(s): No statistically significant differences were found in minor anomalies between children conceived after IVF/ICSI with or without PGS. There is <2.5% chance of >= 10% more major abnormalities in children born after PGS. (Fertil Steril (R) 2013;99:408-13. (C) 2013 by American Society for Reproductive Medicine.)"
"Iron deficiency, one of the most widespread nutritional disorders, affects millions of people in emerging economies and, increasingly, in industrialized countries. Due to the high iron requirements during growth and development, infants and young children are among those most severely affected by iron deficiency. Iron deficiency that occurs during the critical phases of early life development has long-lasting health consequences that are reflected in increased risk of disease, reduced economic productivity and premature death, underscoring the importance of infants and young children as a key target group for addressing iron deficiency. This chapter focuses on the use of fortified foods as a cost-effective mechanism to address iron deficiency in this particularly vulnerable subpopulation. Nutritional policies that include food fortification need to be implemented within the context of effective public-private partnerships in order to address the fundamental mechanisms of accessibility, affordability and availability of nutritious food items for those in the lowest socio-economic strata.

"This paper details a novel method for quantifying irradiation (incident radiant heat flux) at the exposed surface of solid elements during large-scale fire testing. Within the scope of the work presented herein, a type of Thin Skin Calorimeter (TSC) was developed intending for a practical, low cost device enabling the cost-effective mass production required for characterising the thermal boundary conditions during multiple large-scale fire tests. The technical description of the TSC design and a formulation of the proposed calibration technique are presented. This methodology allows for the quantification of irradiation by means of an a posteriori analysis based on a temperature measurement from the TSC, a temperature measurement of the gas-phase in the vicinity of the TSC and a correction factor defined during a pre-test calibration process. The proposed calibration methodology is designed to account for uncertainties inherent to the simplicity of the irradiation measurement technique, therefore not requiring precise information regarding material thermal and optical properties. This methodology is designed and presented so as to enable adaption of the technique to meet the specific requirements of other experimental setups. This is conveyed by means of an example detailing the design and calibration of a device designed for a series of large-scale experiments as part of the 'Real Fires for the Safe Design of Tall Buildings' project.

"Although colonoscopy is predominant among the selection of colorectal cancer screening tests, stool testing (particularly fecal immunochemical testing) has also carved out an important niche for itself. Its simplicity and low cost make it ideal for mass population screening both in the United States and abroad, and it is an alternative choice for those reluctant to undergo endoscopy."
"Diversity of Plants, Traditional Knowledge, and Practices in Local Cosmetics: A Case Study from Alexandria, Egypt. In this study, we explored the diversity of traditional knowledge and plants that have cosmetic values in Alexandria, Egypt. Ethnobotanical data were collected from 396 local Alexandria women using semistructured interviews. Data were analyzed using informant consensus factor (F-IC) and fidelity level (FL) metrics. In total, 27 plant species, belonging to 27 genera and 17 families, were identified as local cosmetic resources. Overall, 63% of these plants (17 species) are used in the form of oils, while the most frequently used organ is plant leaves (41% of all species). Rosmarinus officinalis L. and Cinnamomum verum L. have the largest number of cosmetic uses (8 uses for each). The highest F-IC value was 0.98 for the hair treatment category followed by eyes (0.96), female hormones (0.96), skin (0.93), and face treatment (0.93). Plants with the highest citations in this study for hair treatment were Olea europea L. (54% of all citations) and Lawsonia inermis L. (48% of citations). The most important species according to their fidelity level were Lawsonia inermis L. (FL = 87%) and Eruca sativa L. (FL = 84%) in hair treatments, Linum usitatissimum L. (FL = 83%) as a source of female hormones, Avena sativa L. (FL = 63%) for beautification of women's faces, and Jasminum grandiflorum L. (FL = 46%) for skin treatments. Demographic factors such as education and age play a significant role in the use of herbal remedies. The study reveals the importance of plants in the local cosmetic industry. The high fidelity score and informant consensus factor suggests that traditional knowledge could potentially guide the search for modern cosmetic products."

"<list list-type=""1"" id=""fec12292-list-0001""> Insect pollination is a vital ecosystem service that maintains biodiversity and sustains agricultural crop yields. Social bees are essential insect pollinators, so it is concerning that their populations are in global decline. Although pesticide exposure has been implicated as a possible cause for bee declines, we currently have a limited understanding of the risk these chemicals pose. Whilst environmental exposure to pesticides typically has non-lethal effects on individual bees, recent reports suggest that sublethal exposure can affect important behavioural traits such as foraging. However, at present, we know comparatively little about how natural foraging behaviour is impaired and the relative impacts of acute and chronic effects. Using Radio-Frequency Identification (RFID) tagging technology, we examined how the day-to-day foraging patterns of bumblebees (Bombus terrestris) were affected when exposed to either a neonicotinoid (imidacloprid) and/or a pyrethroid (-cyhalothrin) independently and in combination over a four-week period. This is the first study to provide data on the impacts of combined and individual pesticide exposure on the temporal dynamics of foraging behaviour in the field over a prolonged period of time. Our results show that neonicotinoid exposure has both acute and chronic effects on overall foraging activity. Whilst foragers from control colonies improved their pollen foraging performance as they gained experience, the performance of bees exposed to imidacloprid became worse: chronic behavioural impairment. We also found evidence, suggesting that pesticide exposure can change forager preferences for the flower types from which they collect pollen. Our findings highlight the importance of considering prolonged exposure (which happens in the field) when assessing the risk that pesticides pose to bees. The effects of chronic pesticide exposure could have serious detrimental consequences for both colony survival and also the pollination services provided by these essential insect pollinators. <doi origin=""wiley"" registered=""yes"">10.1111/(ISSN)1365-2435</doi"
"In the present study we provide the first systematic and quantitative hodological study of the calbindin-expressing (CB+) principal neurons in layer II of the entorhinal cortex and compared the respective projections of the lateral and medial subdivisions of the entorhinal cortex. Using elaborate quantitative retrograde tracing, complemented by anterograde tracing, we report that the layer II CB+ population comprises neurons with diverse, mainly excitatory projections. At least half of them originate local intrinsic and commissural projections which distribute mainly to layer I and II. We further show that long-range CB+ projections from the two entorhinal subdivisions differ substantially in that MEC projections mainly target field CA1 of the hippocampus, whereas LEC CB+ projections distribute much more widely to a substantial number of known forebrain targets. This connectional difference between the CB+ populations in LEC and MEC is reminiscent of the overall projection pattern of the two entorhinal subdivisions."
"A fluorescent probe( 4) for the detection of biothiols was designed and synthesized and its proper. ties for labeling glutathione was investigated. After reaction with glutathione in 2-[ 4-( 2-hydroxyethyl)-1- piperazinyl] ethanesulfonic acid( HEPES) buffer, the color of solution changed from light yellow to pink, which could be detected by naked eyes. Meanwhile, the fluorescence was enhanced at 608 nm. Probe 4 was useful for measuring glutathione at concentrations ranging from 1. 6x10(-5) to 2x10(-4) mol/L with a detection limit of 8.9x10(-7) mol/L. Besides, probe 4 was sensitive to glutathione in MCF-7 cells, which emitted red fluorescence when it was incubated with MCF-7 cells."

"The Heilongjiang River Basin in the eastern Siberia, one of the largest river basins draining to the North Pacific Ocean, is a border river between China, Mongolia, and Russia. In this study, we examined the spatial and seasonal variability in dissolved organic carbon (DOC), dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC), and dissolved total carbon (DTC) concentrations along lower reaches of Heilongjiang River Basin, China. Water samples were collected monthly along the mouths of main rivers (Heilongjiang River, Wusuli River, and Songhua River) and their ten tributary waters for 2 years. The DOC concentrations of waters ranged from 1.74 to 16.64 mg/L, with a mean value of 8.90 +/- 0.27 mg/L (n = 165). Notably, mean DIC concentrations were 9.08 +/- 0.31 mg/L, accounting for 13.26 similar to 83.27 % of DTC. DIC concentrations increased significantly after the Heilongjiang River passed through Northeast China, while DOC concentrations decreased. Over 50 % of DIC concentrations were decreased during exports from groundwater to rice fields and from rice fields to ditches. Water dissolved carbon showed large spatial and temporal variations during the 2-year measurement, suggesting that more frequently samplings were required. Carbon (DIC + DOC) loads from the Heilongjiang River to the Sea of Okhotsk were estimated to be 3.26 Tg C/year in this study, accounting for 0.64 % of the global water dissolved carbon flux. DIC export contributed an average of 51.84 % of the estimated carbon load in the Heilongjiang River, acting as an important carbon component during riverine transport. Our study could provide some guides on agricultural water management and contribute to more accurately estimate global carbon budgets."
"This paper is concerned with the model reduction of positive systems. For a given stable positive system, our attention is focused on the construction of a reduced-order model in such a way that the positivity of the original system is preserved and the error system is stable with a prescribed H-infinity performance. Based upon a system augmentation approach, a novel characterization on the stability with H-infinity performance of the error system is first obtained in terms of linear matrix inequality (LMI). Then, a necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of a desired reduced-order model is derived accordingly. Furthermore, iterative LMI approaches with primal and dual forms are developed to solve the positivity-preserving H-infinity model reduction problem. Finally, a compartmental network is provided to show the effectiveness of the proposed techniques. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."
"Objective: This study is to investigate the effects of mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) transplantation in burn treatment. Methods: Wharton's Jelly was stripped from neonatal umbilical cord, and human umbilical cord MSCs were then cultured. Burn models were constructed in male SD rats weighted at 200 +/- 5 g, and the rats were randomly divided into control and MSCs transplantation groups. The rats in transplantation group were injected subcutaneously with MSCs (2x10(6)) at 24 h after burning. Blood samples were collected at 0 d, 1 d, 2 d, 3 d, 5 d and 7 d after burning and the contents of white blood cells (WBC), C-reactive protein (CRP), interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), interleukin-6 (IL-6) and interleukin-10 (IL-10) were detected. The wound healing rate at 7 d, 14 d, 21 d and 28 d together with the wound healing time were compared and analyzed statistically by analysis of variance (ANOVA). Results: WBC and CRP in control group increased significantly at 1 d and 2 d, 2 d and 3 d, respectively. IFN-gamma, IL-6 and IL-10 levels in serum showed increasing till 5th day and TNF-alpha arrived its peak value at 7th day. By contrast, WBC, CRP, TNF-alpha, IL-6 and IL-10 in the MSCs transplantation group showed slight increase after burning and the differences were verified by statistically analysis. IFN-gamma showed no significant difference between the two groups. MSCs transplantation group showed significantly higher wound healing rate at 14 d, 21 d, 28 d and showed shorter wound healing time than control. Conclusions: MSCs transplantation could suppress secondary inflammatory reaction by lowering inflammatory cytokines after burning, thus promoting wound healing and scald repair in burn animal model."
"Study Design. Retrospective database analysis. Objective. To determine the national incidence, mortality, and risk factors for dysphagia associated with anterior cervical spinal fusion surgery in the United States. Summary of Background Data. Dysphagia is a known complication associated with anterior cervical fusion (ACF). A population-based database was analyzed to characterize the incidence of dysphagia in terms of demographics, mortality, and risk factors associated with ACF. Methods. Data from the Nationwide Inpatient Sample of the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project were obtained from 2002 to 2009. Patients undergoing ACF for cervical myelopathy and/ or radiculopathy were identifi ed and separated into cohorts (1-to 2-level and 3 + -level fusions), and incidences of dysphagia were identifi ed. Demographics, length of stay, costs, mortality, and use of bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) were assessed. Statistical data were analyzed in SPSS (version 20), using the Student t test for discrete variables was used to identify independent predictors of dysphagia. A P value of less than 0.001 was used to denote signifi cance. Results. A total of 159,590 ACF cases were identifi ed of which 139,434 were 1- to 2-level ACF and 20,156 were 3 + -level ACF. The incidence of dysphagia in the 3 + -level ACF group was double that of the 1- to 2-level ACF group (44.8 vs. 22.4 per 1000; P < 0.001). Patients with dysphagia were signifi cantly older than patients without dysphagia (P < 0.001). Dysphagia was more common in males undergoing 1- to 2-level ACF (P < 0.001). BMP was used more frequently for patients with dysphagia in the 1- to 2-level ACF group (9.4% vs. 7.2% of cases; P < 0.001). Logistic regression analysis demonstrated that independent predictors for dysphagia included age (= 65 yr), male sex, 3 + -level fusion, BMP use, and preoperative patient comorbidities. Conclusion. Dysphagia occurs twice as often after 3 + -level ACF compared with 1-to 2-level ACF. Utilization of BMP was also linked to an increased incidence of dysphagia in the 1- to 2-level ACF group. Regardless of the number of levels fused, patients experiencing dysphagia had increased age, comorbid risk factors, hospitalizations, and costs."
"Double Loop Electrochemical Potentiokinetic Reactivation testing has been employed to experimentally determine the degree of sensitization (DOS) of an austenitic stainless steel subjected to isothermal heat treatment for various times in the temperature range 700-820 degrees C. For the different heat treatment conditions, the chromium concentration profiles across grain boundaries were calculated using the diffusion module in Thermo-Calc (R) based on the assumptions that sensitization is caused by grain boundary M23C6 precipitates and that local multicomponent equilibrium and flux balance exist at the carbide - matrix interface. Comparison of the experimental DOS values and the details of the chromium concentration profiles was used to establish a quantitative depletion factor that predicts sensitization at short annealing times."
"This paper presents a comparative study on the size optimization of four mesostructures to meet the design requirements for a nonpneumatic tire's (NPT) shear beam with 10% shear flexure (SF) at 10 MPa effective shear modulus. The need for such comparison is motivated from the previous research wherein a systematic design method is proposed to design a mesostructure with high SF by studying the strain energy distribution pattern in honeycomb, auxetic, and sinusoidal auxetic mesostructure. Based upon the distribution pattern, a new type of mesostructure termed S-type is invented. Although it exhibited higher SF than the other mesostructures for a comparable set of geometry, it is not possible to validate the design method without exploring the complete design space of both existing and newly invented mesostructures. In order to address this limitation, these four mesostructures are optimized using the following optimization algorithms: (i) particle swarm; (ii) genetic algorithm (GA); and (iii) FAST-SIMPLEX (using response surface method). The results show the S-type mesostructure can be configured to meet the design requirements, thereby validating the design method presented in previous research. Additionally, it is also observed that auxetic mesostructure is only 5% less than the required design target, which presents an opportunity in future, to develop an alternate design method to maximize SF other than the one that is being validated in this paper."

"The aim of the present numerical study is to investigate the convective flow and heat transfer behaviour of nanofluids with different nano-particles in a square cavity. The hot left wall temperature of the cavity is varied linearly with height whereas the cold right wall temperature is kept constant. The finite volume method is used to discretise the transport equations, which are solved by iterative method. Numerical simulations are carried out for different combinations of pertinent parameters involved in the study. It is found that the heat transfer rate increases on increasing the volume fraction of the nanofluid for all types of nanoparticles considered. The increment in average Nusselt number is strongly dependent on the nanoparticle chosen."
"The existing evaluation methods for location privacy protection mechanism (LPPM) focus mainly on location privacy at the time of issuing a location-based query, and rarely consider trajectory privacy from where multiple successive queries are issued. This paper provides a user-centric analysis of trajectory privacy protection against tracking attacks in presence of quality-loss and energy constraints, focusing on impact of user query behavior within a certain period of time. We consider an attacker with adversarial knowledge on users' activity and mobility profiles to run tracking attacks, against which users employ LPPMs that incorporate location semantic diversity to maximize trajectory privacy. The attack and defense problems are formalized as a Bayesian Stackelberg game for quantitative analysis. Real location traces are used to assess the LPPMs' effectiveness, and to find optimal query strategy. The results confirm that query behavior has a significant impact on improving trajectory privacy. Despite increased number of queries to improve trajectory privacy, the effectiveness may be decreased with a longer observation time. At the same query rate, prolonging observation time is beneficial for privacy improvement. We also find that dummy-based LPPM often provides better protection with a stringent energy constraint, while precision-based LPPM performs better under a stringent quality-loss constraint or under a loose energy constraint. At optimal trajectory privacy, quality-loss of precision-based LPPM is lower than that of dummy-based LPPM, but there is an opposite result in terms of energy cost."
"The objective of the study was to determine the origin and to reconstruct the geological evolution of lignites from the Drmno field (Kostolac Basin, Serbia). For this purpose, petrological and organic geochemical analyses were used. Coal from the Drmno field is typical humic coal. Peat-forming vegetation dominated by decay of resistant gymnosperm (coniferous) plants, followed by prokaryotic organisms and angiosperms. The coal forming plants belonged to the gymnosperm families Taxodiaceae, Podocarpaceae, Cupressaceae, Araucariaceae, Phyllocladaceae and Pinaceae. Peatification was realised in a neutral to slightly acidic, fresh water environment. Considering that the organic matter of the Drmno lignites was deposited at the same time, in a relatively constant climate, it could be supposed that climate probably had only a small impact on peatification. Therefore, variations in compositions of macerals and biomarkers indicate changes in the water level, due to seasonal drying of the mire, which caused vegetation differences in the palaeoplant communities and changes in the redox conditions (from anoxic to slightly oxic) during peatification. Diagenetic transformations of the organic matter were mainly governed by microbial activity, rather than thermal alteration."
"QuickFF is a software package to derive accurate force fields for isolated and complex molecular systems in a quick and easy manner. Apart from its general applicability, the program has been designed to generate force fields for metal-organic frameworks in an automated fashion. The force field parameters for the covalent interaction are derived from ab initio data. The mathematical expression of the covalent energy is kept simple to ensure robustness and to avoid fitting deficiencies as much as possible. The user needs to produce an equilibrium structure and a Hessian matrix for one or more building units. Afterward, a force field is generated for the system using a three-step method implemented in QuickFF. The first two steps of the methodology are designed to minimize correlations among the force field parameters. In the last step, the parameters are refined by imposing the force field parameters to reproduce the ab initio Hessian matrix in Cartesian coordinate space as accurate as possible. The method is applied on a set of 1000 organic molecules to show the easiness of the software protocol. To illustrate its application to metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), QuickFF is used to determine force fields for MIL-53(Al) and MOF-5. For both materials, accurate force fields were already generated in literature but they requested a lot of manual interventions. QuickFF is a tool that can easily be used by anyone with a basic knowledge of performing ab initio calculations. As a result, accurate force fields are generated with minimal effort.

"The expression of anti-predator adaptations may vary on a spatial scale, favouring traits that are advantageous in a given predation regime. Besides, evolution of different developmental strategies depends to a large extent on the grain of the environment and may result in locally canalized adaptations or, alternatively, the evolution of phenotypic plasticity as different predation regimes may vary across habitats. We investigated the potential for predator-driven variability in shell morphology in a freshwater snail, Radix balthica, and whether found differences were a specialized ecotype adaptation or a result of phenotypic plasticity. Shell shape was quantified in snails from geographically separated pond populations with and without molluscivorous fish. Subsequently, in a common garden experiment we investigated reaction norms of snails from populations' with/without fish when exposed to chemical cues from tench (Tinca tinca), a molluscivorous fish. We found that snails from fish-free ponds had a narrow shell with a well developed spire, whereas snails that coexisted with fish had more rotund shells with a low spire, a shell morphology known to increase survival rate from shell-crushing predators. The common garden experiment mirrored the results from the field survey and showed that snails had similar reaction norms in response to chemical predator cues, i.e. the expression of shell shape was independent of population origin. Finally, we found significant differences for the trait means among populations, within each pond category (fish/fish free), suggesting a genetic component in the determination of shell morphology that has evolved independently across ponds."
"This article focuses on emerging forms of formative intervention research in educational settings in the United States. The examples presented share three key features with cultural-historical activity theory (CHAT) formative intervention research: (a) a focus on historically accumulating structural tensions within and across activity systems, (b) use of double-stimulation as a method of intervention, and (c) expanding agency as the object of intervention. The examples differ from CHAT approaches in that they employ theories and tools from research on subject-matter learning and organizations. In presenting these examples, I aim to renew dialogue between CHAT researchers and learning scientists about intervention research."
"Although basketball is a dualistic sport, with all players competing on both offense and defense, almost all of the sport's conventional metrics are designed to summarize offensive play. As a result, player valuations are largely based on offensive performances and to a much lesser degree on defensive ones. Steals, blocks and defensive rebounds provide only a limited summary of defensive effectiveness, yet they persist because they summarize salient events that are easy to observe. Due to the inefficacy of traditional defensive statistics, the state of the art in defensive analytics remains qualitative, based on expert intuition and analysis that can be prone to human biases and imprecision. Fortunately, emerging optical player tracking systems have the potential to enable a richer quantitative characterization of basketball performance, particularly defensive performance. Unfortunately, due to computational and methodological complexities, that potential remains unmet. This paper attempts to fill this void, combining spatial and spatio-temporal processes, matrix factorization techniques and hierarchical regression models with player tracking data to advance the state of defensive analytics in the NBA. Our approach detects, characterizes and quantifies multiple aspects of defensive play in basketball, supporting some common understandings of defensive effectiveness, challenging others and opening up many new insights into the defensive elements of basketball."
"Complexins play a critical role in the regulation of neurotransmission by regulating SNARE-mediated exocytosis of synaptic vesicles. Complexins can exert either a facilitatory or an inhibitory effect on neurotransmitter release, depending on the context, and different complexin domains contribute differently to these opposing roles. Structural characterization of the central helix domain of complexin bound to the assembled SNARE bundle provided key insights into the functional mechanism of this domain of complexin, which is critical for both complexin activities, but many questions remain, particularly regarding the roles and mechanisms of other complexin domains. Recent progress has clarified the structural properties of these additional domains, and has led to various proposals regarding how they contribute to complexin function. This chapter describes spectroscopic approaches used in our laboratory and others, primarily involving circular dichroism and solution-state NMR spectroscopy, to characterize structure within complexins when isolated or when bound to interaction partners. The ability to characterize complexin structure enables structure/function studies employing in vitro or in vivo assays of complexin function. More generally, these types of approaches can be used to study the binding of other intrinsically disordered proteins or protein regions to membrane surfaces or for that matter to other large physiological binding partners."
"Equivalent electrical circuits are useful simulation tools to emulate and investigate the behavior of electromechanically coupled systems and structures as well as to develop energy harvesting or control circuits, among other configurations with two-way coupling. The existing efforts in this context have mostly considered linear structural (mechanical) domain, occasionally with nonlinear circuit for signal process and control. Typically, resonant circuits are employed to represent the mechanical domain of single-or multi-degree-of-freedom systems, while ideal transformers or current-and voltage-dependent sources are employed to model the electromechanical coupling. However, practical limitations of ideal transformers and dependent sources are challenges for experimental implementations of equivalent circuits. Furthermore, the internal resistance of equivalent resonant circuits limits the representation of high quality factor systems. This paper introduces equivalent electrical circuits for linear and nonlinear electromechanically coupled systems with high quality factor and various types of nonlinearities. The focus is placed on piezoelectric structures that exhibit stiffness and damping nonlinearities. An alternative to the existing models for the electromechanical coupling is also presented for convenient simulation of coupled system dynamics using standard electronic simulation programs. The equivalent circuit framework given here for high quality factor electromechanical systems is validated against both linear and nonlinear case studies, including published data for a nonlinear piezoelectric energy harvester. The proposed framework paves the way for the design of circuits emulating nonlinear structures, such as nonlinear vibration absorbers and sinks."
"Humans have decimated populations of large-bodied consumers and their functions in most of the world's ecosystems. It is less clear how human activities have affected the diversity of habitats these consumers occupy. Rebounding populations of some predators after conservation provides an opportunity to begin to investigate this question. Recent research shows that following longterm protection, sea otters along the northeast Pacific coast have expanded into estuarine marshes and seagrasses, and alligators on the southeast US coast have expanded into saltwater ecosystems, habitats presently thought beyond their niche space. There is also evidence that seals have expanded into subtropical climates, mountain lions into grasslands, orangutans into disturbed forests and wolves into coastal marine ecosystems. Historical records, surveys of protected areas and patterns of animals moving into habitats that were former hunting hotspots indicate that - rather than occupying them for the first time - many of these animals are in fact recolonizing ecosystems. Recognizing that many large consumers naturally live and thrive across a greater diversity of ecosystems has implications for setting historical baselines for predator diversity within specific habitats, enhancing the resilience of newly colonized ecosystems and for plans to recover endangered species, as a greater range of habitats is available for large consumers as refugia from climate-induced threats."
"The muon-to-electron conversion experiment (Mu2e) at Fermilab is designed to explore charged lepton flavor violation. It is composed of three large superconducting solenoids: the production solenoid, the transport solenoid (TS), and the detector solenoid. The TS is formed by two magnets: TS upstream and TS downstream. Each has its own cryostat and power supply. Tolerance sensitivity studies of the position and angular alignment of each coil in this magnet system were performed in the past with the objective to demonstrate that the magnet design meets all the field requirements. The alignment of the cold masses is critical to maximize the transmission of muons and to avoid possible backgrounds that would reduce the sensitivity of the experiment. Each TS magnet cold mass can be individually aligned. In this paper, we discuss the implications of the alignment of the TS cold masses in terms of the displacement of the magnetic center. Consideration of the practical mechanical limits is also presented."
"Literature on Belgian language legislation frequently sets off from stable identities which are stably represented at parliament. This paper intends to shed a new light on the establishment of the law on ""language in administrative matters"" of 1932 through the integration of linguistic methods. The identification and ""alterification"" processes of several representatives are closely analyzed in the specific case study of the Chamber debates. By ""alterification"" we mean the negative representation of the ""other"". We dissected the different (linguistic) groups in which the Members of the Chamber categorized themselves or others during the debates, and searched for the features they explicitly or inexplicitly used to legitimate their arguments. We examined the different themes under discussion to see whether there was question of geographical identification (national, sub-national or regional), and whether this was reinforced or coupled to other forms of identification such as party political ties. This allows to establish the way in which the new law on language in administrative matters came about in 1932, and with which groups individual politicians identified in order to legitimize their position, and how this changed throughout the debates. In other words, the attention is shifted from the ultimate results towards the previous process, and thereby to the rather complex dynamics of inclusion and exclusion hiding behind the relatively univocal vote. It appears indeed that the tensions were much stronger than acknowledged by existing literature, namely within the francophone and the Brussels groups."
"Radionuclide-based reporter gene imaging has the sensitivity to monitor gene- and cell-based therapies in human subjects. Potential immunogenicity of current viral transgenes warrants development of human-based reporter systems. We compared human nucleoside kinase reporters to a panel of nucleoside analogs of FEAU, FMAU, and FIAU, including the first in vivo assessment of l-[F-18]FEAU. Human isogenic U87 cell lines were transduced to express different human reporter genes including dCK-R104M/D133A (dCKDM), dCK-R104Q/D133N (dCKep16A), dCK-A100V/R104M/D133A (dCK3M), and TK2-N93D/L109F (TK2DM), and wild-type dCK (dCK) and herpes simplex virus type-1 (HSVTK) reporter gene as references. In vitro cell uptake assays were performed with [F-18]FEAU, l-[F-18]FEAU, [C-14]FMAU, l-[F-18]FMAU, and [I-124]FIAU. Micro-positron emission tomography/X-ray computed tomography imaging of xenograft-bearing nu/nu mice was conducted with [F-18]FEAU, l-[F-18]FEAU, l-[F-18]FMAU, and [I-124]FIAU on consecutive days. A cell viability assay was also performed to assess sensitivities to gemcitabine and bromovinyldeoxyuridine (BVdU). In vitro, dCKep16A and dCKDM with [F-18]FEAU exhibited the highest sensitivity and selectivity of the human reporters, second only to HSVTK/[F-18]FEAU. l-[F-18]FEAU biodistribution in mice was on par with [F-18]FEAU and l-[F-18]FMAU. l-[F-18]FMAU uptake in isogenic xenografts was highest for all human reporter genes. However, [F-18]FEAU was the most selective of the short half-life reporter probes due to its minimal recognition by human dCK and relative sensitivity, whereas [I-124]FIAU permitted imaging at a later time point, improving signal-to-background ratio. Of the human reporter genes, dCKep16A consistently outperformed the other tested reporters. Reporter genes of interest increased potency to the nucleoside analog prodrugs gemcitabine and BVdU. We demonstrate that human nucleoside kinase reporter systems vary significantly in their sensitivity and selectivity for in vivo imaging. The sufficiently high signal-to-background ratios and enhanced suicide gene potential support clinical translation."
"This study aimed to verify whether children with dyslexia have difficulties in executive functions (shifting, working memory, inhibition). Methods: A sample of 47 children (ages 8-13 years) participated in the study: 24 who were dyslexic and 23 controls with typical development. A battery of neuropsychological tests was used. Results: Results revealed executive function difficulties among the dyslexic children when compared with controls, encompassing selective attention modulation processes, shifting, and inhibitory control. These difficulties appeared to be affected by phonological working memory deficits, typically associated with dyslexia. Conclusion: Our findings support the consensus among scholars regarding the central involvement of phonological skill dysfunctions in dyslexia."

"In this work, a microbial lipase recovery scheme based on aqueous two-phase systems (ATPS) formed by a biocompatible ionic liquid (IL) and a thermo-sensitive polymer was studied. The IL composed of naturally derived cholinium cation and anion obtained from biological buffer, i.e. BES, designated as [Ch][BES], was used to prepare ATPS with polypropylene glycol with an average molecular weight of 400 g mol(-1) (PPG 400). In conjugation with centrifugation step as pre-purification, the IL/polymer-based ATPS achieved an enhanced recovery of lipase from fermentation broth with a purification factor of 17.96 +/- 0.32 and a recovery yield of 99.30% +/- 0.03, after evaluating several phase compositions and feed-stock loads. The recycling use of both phase-forming components was investigated, and there was no significant difference in the purification results with the use of recycled components compared to the systems using fresh chemicals. The proposed system is associated with many advantageous properties such as fast, simple, high biocompatibility, marginally toxicity, non-volatility, buffering capacity and recyclability, supporting its potential as a viable and sustainable platform for lipase purification.

"Understanding the differences in yield traits of rice among pothole seedling of mechanical transplanting (PSMT), carpet seedling of mechanical transplanting (CSMT) and mechanical direct seeding (MDS) is of great importance not only for rice scientists but also for rice farmers to develop a high-yield production system under mechanical conditions in a rice-wheat rotation system. However, such traits are yet to be studied among rice varieties of japonica-indica hybrid rice (JIHR), japonica conventional rice (JCR) and indica hybrid rice (IHR). Field experiments were conducted in 2014 and 2015, where six cultivars of the three rice types JIHR, JCR and IHR were grown individually with PSMT, CSMT and MDS methods, under respective managements for each method to achieve the maximum attainable yield. Results showed that CO the PSMT significantly increased grain yield of JIHR by 22.0 and 7.1%, of JCR by 15.6 and 3.7% and of IHR by 22.5 and 7.4%, compared to MDS and CSMT on average across the two years, respectively. The highest yield was produced by the combination of JIHR and PSMT; (ii) high yield under PSMT was mainly attributed to large sink capacity and high-efficient dry matter accumulation. With sufficient panicles per hectare, the increase of spikelet number per panicle, especially the increase in spikelet number of the secondary rachis-branches was determined to be the optimal approach for developing a large sink capacity for rice under PSMT. The optimal tillers development, large leaf area index at heading stage, and high leaf area duration, crop growth rate and net assimilation rate during grain-filling phase could be the cause of sufficient dry matter accumulation for rice under PSMT; (iii) moreover, the PSMT favored plant growth as well as enriched the stems plus sheaths during grain-filling phase, as compared with CSMT and MDS. These results suggest that PSMT may be an alternative approach to increasing grain yield in a rice-wheat rotation system in the lower reaches of the Yangtze River in China."
"Multiple iron atoms bridged by hydrides is a common structural feature of the active species that have been postulated in the biological and industrial reduction of N-2. In this study, the reactions of an Fe(II) amide complex with pinacolborane in the presence/absence of phosphines afforded a series of hydride-supported [Fe-4] and [Fe-6] clusters Fe-4(mu-H)(4)(mu(3)-H)(2){N(SiMe3)(2)}(2)(PR3)(4) (PR3 = PMe3 (2a), PMe2Ph (2b), PEt3 (2c)), Fe-6(mu-H)(10)(mu(3)-H)(2)(PMe3)(10) (3), and (eta(C7H8)-C-6)Fe-4(mu-H)(2){mu-N(SiMe3)(2)}N(SiMe3)(2)}(2) (4), which were characterized crystallographically and spectroscopically. Under ambient conditions, these clusters catalyzed the silylation of N-2 to furnish up to 160 +/- 13 equiv of N(SiMe3)(3) per 2c (40 equiv per Fe atom) and 183 +/- 18 equiv per 3 (31 equiv per Fe atom). With regard to the, generation of the reactive species, dissociation of phosphine and hydride ligands from the [Fe-4] and [Fe-6] clusters was indicated, based on the results of the mass spectrometric analysis on the [Fe-6] duster, as well as the formation of a diphenylsilane adduct of the [Fe-4] cluster."
"When hit by a high-velocity projectile, a fluid-filled container might suffer from Hydrodynamic Ram. The entire tank structure can possibly rupture due to the loads from primary shock wave and a cavity developed in the liquid. In this paper, a countermeasure, of which the rubber layer is inserted on the walls of the tank, is proposed to alleviate the dynamic response of fluid-filled container under the impact of high-velocity projectile. The applicability of the numerical method in simulating the process of high speed projectile penetrates the fluid-filled container is validated by comparing the numerical results with the experimental data in the literature. Then, numerical simulations were conducted to investigate the process of projectile penetrates the fluid-filled container with rubber layer insertion between the walls of container and fluid, with the velocities of 450 m/s, 600 m/s, 750 m/s, 900 m/s and 1050 m/s, respectively. The influence of rubber layer on the dynamic responses of tank walls, the change of pressure of shock wave in water and the energy absorption of structural walls and rubber layers were analyzed. The results indicate that the rubber layer has a significant effect on shock wave acting on container walls. The dynamic response of liquid tank under the loading of the shock wave and local pressure, which is caused by the high speed fragments traveling in the fluid, decreases remarkably.

"This work presents a molecular dynamics simulation study on the interfacial characterization of graphene/epoxy nanocomposites. In polymeric nanocomposites, the thermo-mechanical properties of a system strongly depend on the characteristics of the interphase region between the matrix and the inclusions. The first step in the characterization of this interphase is to distinguish its border limit (i.e., the interphase thickness). Here, we present a methodology to systematically quantify the interphase thickness based on analyzing the variation of the local mass density profile. To this end, three functions (average accumulated mass density, accumulated standard deviation (ASD) and its first derivative) are successively applied on the local mass density profile. Using this procedure, the interphase limit can be easily detected regardless of the oscillatory nature of the local mass density. The effect of the epoxy crosslinking density and number of graphene layers on the interphase thickness is then investigated, and the results are analyzed by studying the interaction energies, polymer dynamics and distribution quality of reacted and unreacted components, as well as conformational changes of the polymer chains in the interphase region. The results reveal that the crosslinking density is the most influential parameter on the interphase thickness: the higher the crosslinking degree, the thicker the interphase region. To a lower extent, the interaction energy has also an effect on the interphase thickness since there is an inverse relationship between the interaction energy and the crosslinking density in our case study. Overall, the reported findings highlight useful insights into the detection and properties of the interphase region in thermoset composites."
"This study examined the effects of preceding contextual stimuli, either auditory or visual, on the identification of spoken target words. Fifty-one participants (29% males, 71% females; mean age=24.5 years, SD=8.5) were divided into three groups: no context, auditory context, and visual context. All target stimuli were spoken words masked with white noise. The relationships between the context and target stimuli were as follows: identical word, similar word, and unrelated word. Participants presented with context experienced a sequence of six context stimuli in the form of either spoken words or photographs. Auditory and visual context conditions produced similar results, but the auditory context aided word identification more than the visual context in the similar word relationship. We discuss these results in the light of top-down processing, motor theory, and the phonological system of language."
"BackgroundMuscle strength measurements using hand-held dynamometry (HHD) can be affected by the inadequate strength of the tester and lack of stabilization of the participants and the device. A portable HHD anchoring system was designed that enabled the measurement of isometric knee extensor muscle strength in a supine position. This can be used with individuals who are unable to assume the sitting position required for the measurement of knee extensor strength in conventional isokinetic dynamometry (IKD). The aim of this study was to evaluate the reliability and validity of knee extensor strength measurements using this device.MethodsThe maximal knee extensor isometric strength of the dominant leg in healthy adults aged 20 to 40years was tested. Three trials of three contractions were assessed by two raters using the portable dynamometer anchoring system whilst the participant was in the supine position. After the three measurement trials, peak knee extensor torque was evaluated using IKD. The intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) and 95% limits of agreement (LOA) for intra- and inter-rater reliability were obtained.ResultsThirty-nine participants (19 male and 20 female, aged 30.084.16 y), completed the three measurement trials. The ICC for intra-rater reliability was 0.98 for the maximum measurements of knee extensor strength (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.96-0.98) and 0.98 (95% CI: 0.96-0.99) for inter-rater reliability. The mean difference (%) between the maximum knee extensor strength measurements of each trial was 1.02% (LOA range: -11.13 to 13.16%) for intra-rater and-1.44% (LOA range: -13.98 to 11.08%) for inter-rater measurements. The Pearson correlation coefficient of the maximum voluntary peak torque measurements with the portable dynamometer anchoring system and IKD was 0.927.ConclusionsThe portable dynamometer anchoring system is a reliable and valid tool for measuring isometric knee extensor strength in a supine position. Future clinical feasibility studies are needed to determine if this equipment can be applied to people with severe illness or disabilities.Trial registration KCT0003041."
"There is increasing interest in recovering phosphorus (P) from various wastewater streams for beneficial use as fertilizer and to minimize environmental impacts of excess P on receiving waters. One such example is P recovery from human urine, which has a high concentration of phosphate (200-800 mg P/L) and accounts for a small volume (similar to 1%) of total wastewater flow. Accordingly, the goal of this study was to evaluate the potential to recover P from source-separated and combined wastewater streams that included undiluted human urine, urine diluted with tap water, greywater, mixture of urine and greywater, anaerobic digester supernatant, and secondary wastewater effluent. A hybrid anion exchange (HAIX) resin containing hydrous ferric oxide was used to recover P because of its selectivity for phosphate and the option to precipitate P minerals in the waste regeneration solution. The P recovery potential was fresh urine > hydrolyzed urine > greywater > biological wastewater effluent > anaerobic digester supernatant. The maximum loading of P on HAIX resin was fresh urine > hydrolyzed urine > anaerobic digester supernatant approximate to greywater > biological wastewater effluent. Results indicated that the sorption capacity of HAIX resin for phosphate and the total P recovery potential were greater for source-separated urine than the combined wastewater streams of secondary wastewater effluent and anaerobic digester supernatant. Dilution of urine with tap water decreased the phosphate loading on HAIX resin. The results of this work advance the current understanding of nutrient recovery from complex wastewater streams by sorption processes. 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."
"A highly efficient palladium-catalyzed decarbonylative dehydration reaction of carboxylic acids is reported. This method transforms abundant and renewable even-numbered natural fatty acids into valuable and expensive odd-numbered alpha olefins. Additionally, the chemistry displays a high functional group tolerance. The process employs a low loading of palladium catalyst and proceeds under solvent-free and relatively mild conditions."
"Sensor networks have a lot of applications such as battlefield surveillance, environmental monitoring, and industrial diagnostics. Coverage is one of the most important performance metrics for sensor networks since it reflects how well a sensor field is monitored. In this paper, we introduce the maximum coverage deployment problem in wireless sensor networks and analyze the properties of the problem and its solution space. Random deployment is the simplest way to deploy sensor nodes but may cause unbalanced deployment and therefore, we need a more intelligent way for sensor deployment. We found that the phenotype space of the problem is a quotient space of the genotype space in a mathematical view. Based on this property, we propose an efficient genetic algorithm using a novel normalization method. A Monte Carlo method is adopted to design an efficient evaluation function, and its computation time is decreased without loss of solution quality using a method that starts from a small number of random samples and gradually increases the number for subsequent generations. The proposed genetic algorithms could be further improved by combining with a well-designed local search. The performance of the proposed genetic algorithm is shown by a comparative experimental study. When compared with random deployment and existing methods, our genetic algorithm was not only about twice faster, but also showed significant performance improvement in quality."

"Toll-like receptors are innate immunity receptors that activate inflammation and adaptive immunity. Our objectives were to analyze the association between TLR3, 7, 8 and 9 expressions and clinical outcome in patients with ischemic stroke and the expression of inflammatory molecules. One hundred-ten patients with ischemic stroke were included within 12 h of symptoms onset. Stroke severity was evaluated by the NIHSS, and functional outcome was assessed at 3 months by the modified Rankin Scale. Infarct volume at 4-7 days was measured on Computed Tomography imaging. TLR7 and TLR8 at different time points were independently associated with poor outcome. TLR8 was also correlated with infarct volumes. Furthermore, TLR7 and TLR8 on admission were correlated with levels of IL6 and IL1 beta at 24 h, 72 h and 7 days. In conclusion, TLR 7 and TLR8 expressions are associated with poor outcome and greater inflammatory response in acute ischemic stroke. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved."
"Genetically identical cells contain variable numbers of molecules, even if the cells share the same environment. This stochastic variability is prominent when molecules have low abundance, which is the case for mRNA noise. Most studies focused on how transcription affects mRNA noise, and little is known about the role of RNA degradation. To discriminate the fluctuations in these processes during the decay of a pair of reporter mRNAs, we quantified the uncorrelated intrinsic and the correlated extrinsic noise using single-molecule RNA FISH. Intrinsic noise converges to the Poisson level during the decay. mRNAs that have a short half-life are more susceptible to extrinsic noise than stable mRNAs. However, the Xrn1 exonuclease and the NMD pathways, which degrade mRNAs rapidly, were found to have lower fluctuation, which mitigates the noise of the short-lived mRNAs. This permits low variability across the entire range of mRNA half-lives."
"Purpose The growing concern about school violence and security has led to a dramatic increase in the number of police officers working in schools. This increase has been accompanied by a focus on the training of school-based law enforcement, the discretion that they exercise when interacting with youth, and the concern that these factors may lead to more youths facing arrest and formal processing by the juvenile and criminal justice system. What is not well understood is whether or not having formal school resource officer (SRO) training or higher education impacts the officer's decision making when responding to an incident involving a student. The paper aims to discuss these issues. Design/methodology/approach This paper uses survey data from school police officers within the USA (n=179) to examine the officer's preferred post-incident method of disciplining the youth, from the most punitive and formal approach of suspension or referral to juvenile authorities, to the less punitive and informal approach such as diversion or warn and release. Findings Overall, the study found that officers who have received formal SRO training were more likely to prefer a formal resolution to the incidents, and more highly educated officers tended to favor less punitive and informal responses. Originality/value These findings question the current state of the effectiveness of SRO training at using diversionary tactics for conflict resolution in a school setting."
In situ three-dimensional (3-D) X-ray synchrotron tomography of fatigue crack growth was conducted in a 7075-T6 aluminum alloy. Local measurements of da/dN were possible with the 3-D data sets obtained from tomography. A comparison with fatigue striation spacings obtained from scanning electron microscopy of the fracture surfaces yielded excellent correlation with da/dN obtained from tomography. The X-ray tomography technique can be used to obtain a highly accurate and representative measurements of crack growth locally in the microstructure of the material.
"Purpose. The purpose of the study was to examine the independent associations of adiposity and cardiorespiratory fitness with clustered cardiometabolic risk. Methods. A cross-sectional sample of 192 adolescents (118 boys), aged 14-16 years, was recruited from a South Lanarkshire school in the West of Scotland. Anthropometry and blood pressure were measured, and blood samples were taken. The 20 m multistage fitness test was the indicator of cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF). A clustered cardiometabolic risk score was constructed from HDL-C (inverted), LDL-C, HOMA, systolic blood pressure, and triglycerides. Interleukin-6, C-reactive protein, and adiponectin were also measured and examined relative to the clustered cardiometabolic risk score, CRF, and adiposity. Results. Although significant, partial correlations between BMI and waist circumference (WC) and both CRF and adiponectin were negative and weak to moderate, while correlations between the BMI and WC and CRP were positive but weak to moderate. Weak to moderate negative associations were also evident for adiponectin with CRP, IL-6, and clustered cardiometabolic risk. WC was positively associated while CRF was negatively associated with clustered cardiometabolic risk. With the additional adjustment for either WC or CRF, the independent associations with cardiometabolic risk persisted. Conclusion. WC and CRF are independently associated with clustered cardiometabolic risk in Scottish adolescents."
"The aim of this study was to compare the ability of brain magnetic resonance imaging angiography and brain magnetic resonance imaging cisternography of showing the neurovascular contiguity of the facial nerve in patients with hemifacial spasm. This study included a total of 35 patients (28 females, 7 males), with an average age of 57.5 +/- 13.8 years, who presented to our outpatient clinic of movement disorders. All patients were prospectively applied brain magnetic resonance imaging angiography and brain magnetic resonance imaging cisternography, and the results were evaluated by a radiologist who was blind to study protocol. The study included 35 patients, of whom 28 (80 %) were female and 7 (20 %) were male. Brain magnetic resonance imaging angiography demonstrated facial nerve compression of vascular origin in 5 (14.3 %) patients presenting with the clinical presentation of hemifacial spasm. Neurovascular compression of facial nerve was shown by brain magnetic resonance imaging cisternography in 13 (37.1 %) patients. No statistically significant difference was found between brain magnetic resonance imaging angiography and brain magnetic resonance imaging cisternography techniques in detecting a compressive interaction causing hemifacial spasm between facial nerve and adjacent vascular structures (p > 0.05)."
"AimsBeyond single-institution case series, limited data are available to describe risks of performing a concurrent cystectomy at the time of urinary diversion for benign end-stage lower urinary tract dysfunction. Using a population-representative sample, this study aimed to analyze factors associated with perioperative complications in patients undergoing urinary diversion with or without cystectomy. MethodsA representative sample of patients undergoing urinary diversion for benign indications was identified from the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project Nationwide Inpatient Sample from 1998 to 2011. Perioperative complications of urinary diversion with and without concomitant cystectomy were identified and coded using the International Classification of Diseases, version 9. Multivariate logistic regression models identified hospital and patient-level characteristics associated with complications of concomitant cystectomy with urinary diversion. ResultsThere were 15,717 records for urinary diversion identified, of which 31.8% demonstrated perioperative complications: urinary diversion with concurrent cystectomy (35.0%) and urinary diversion without concomitant cystectomy (30.6%). Comparing the two groups, a concomitant cystectomy at the time of urinary diversion was significantly associated with a complication (OR=1.23, 95%CI: 1.03-1.48). Comorbid conditions of obesity, pulmonary circulation disease, drug abuse, weight loss, and electrolyte disorders were positively associated with a complication, while private insurance and southern geographic region were negatively associated. ConclusionsA concomitant cystectomy with urinary diversion for refractory lower urinary tract dysfunction elevates risk in this population-representative sample, particularly in those with certain comorbid conditions. This analysis provides critical information for preoperative patient counseling."
"Simple Summary To increase the feed efficiency, animals are usually fed with total mixed ration (TMR), however, its consumption is also associated with lactic acidosis. To minimize the incidence of lactic acidosis, different feeding systems are used. In this study, we have used malic acid to reduce the clinical signs of lactic acidosis in a total of 32 growing lambs. Lambs were either fed a control (barley and alfalfa ha) diet (control) or TMR (T1), TMR + 20% palm kernel meal (T2), TMR + palm kernel meal 20% + 4 mL/day malic acids (T3). The results showed that propionic acid in the rumen fluid increased in T1 and T3, while lactic acid increased in T2. Rumen and reticulum discoloration were improved in T3 while histomorphological features were higher in T3 and T2. We concluded that the addition of malic acid supplementation to lambs fed PKC caused a significant improvement in the rumen pH and decreased lactic acid concentration in growing Naemi lambs. This study was conducted to investigate the effect of malic acid and 20% palm kernel meal (PKM) on ruminal characteristics. A total of 32 growing lambs were randomly distributed into control (barley and alfalfa ha), total mixed ration (T1), TMR + 20% PKM (T2), TMR + PKC 20% + 4 mL/day malic acids (T3). Lambs were fed these diets ad libitum for 84 days. The results showed that propionic acid in the rumen fluid increased significantly (p < 0.05) in T1 and T3. Lactic acid concentration of rumen fluid increased significantly (p < 0.05) in T2 while the pH increased significantly. The coloration of rumen and reticulum was improved in T3. In addition, most of the histomorphological features were higher in T3 and T2. We concluded that the addition of malic acid supplementation to lambs fed PKC caused a significant improvement in the rumen pH and decreased lactic acid concentration in growing Naemi lambs."
"Aneurysms of the sinus of Valsalva (ASV) are rare, with an incidence ranging from 0.1% to 3.5% of all congenital cardiac defects and a prevalence of 0.009% in an autopsy series.ASVs occur much more frequently in the right coronary sinus of Valsalva. Previous reports, based on necropsy and cardiac surgery findings, estimated that 20% of ASVs are unruptured. Patients with an unruptured ASV may remain asymptomatic for a long period of time until rupture. They may also presented with dyspnea, palpitation, and angina-like chest pain. Aortic insufficiency in the patients with unruptured ASVs is common, and other valvular lesions can be observed in these patients as well. Echocardiography, as a noninvasive and portable tool, is widely used to detect ASVs. Additionally, computed tomography and cardiac magnetic resonance imaging, alone or in combination, can provide precise information about its anatomic extension and intrinsic characteristics of the pathology."
"In order to enhance the thermal conductivity due to magnons, kappa(magnon), in the two-leg spin-ladder system (Ca,Sr,La)(14)Cu24O41, we have grown the single crystals using raw materials with high purity and tried to improve the quality of the single crystals through the annealing in O-2 atmosphere. A large enhancement of kappa(magnon) has been observed through the O-2-annealing in Sr14Cu24O41, while there has been little change in kappa(magnon) of Ca9La5Cu24O41 nor Sr9La5Cu24O41 in spite of the increase of the purity of the raw materials and the O-2-annealing. It has been concluded that the extension of the mean free path of magnons is limited by the disorder of the atomic arrangement due to the mismatch between the (Ca,Sr,La) plane and the Cu2O3 spin-ladder plane in both Ca9La5Cu24O41 and Sr9La5Cu24O41 and that the removal of the disorder of the atomic arrangement in the spin-ladder plane is necessary for the enhancement of kappa(magnon) in (Ca,Sr,La)(14)Cu24O41.

"The site-to-site variability in species composition, known as beta-diversity, is crucial to understanding spatiotemporal patterns of species diversity and the mechanisms controlling community composition and structure. However, quantifying beta-diversity in microbial ecology using sequencing-based technologies is a great challenge because of a high number of sequencing errors, bias, and poor reproducibility and quantification. Herein, based on general sampling theory, a mathematical framework is first developed for simulating the effects of random sampling processes on quantifying beta-diversity when the community size is known or unknown. Also, using an analogous ball example under Poisson sampling with limited sampling efforts, the developed mathematical framework can exactly predict the low reproducibility among technically replicate samples from the same community of a certain species abundance distribution, which provides explicit evidences of random sampling processes as the main factor causing high percentages of technical variations. In addition, the predicted values under Poisson random sampling were highly consistent with the observed low percentages of operational taxonomic unit (OTU) overlap (< 30% and < 20% for two and three tags, respectively, based on both Jaccard and Bray-Curtis dissimilarity indexes), further supporting the hypothesis that the poor reproducibility among technical replicates is due to the artifacts associated with random sampling processes. Finally, a mathematical framework was developed for predicting sampling efforts to achieve a desired overlap among replicate samples. Our modeling simulations predict that several orders of magnitude more sequencing efforts are needed to achieve desired high technical reproducibility. These results suggest that great caution needs to be taken in quantifying and interpreting beta-diversity for microbial community analysis using next-generation sequencing technologies. IMPORTANCE Due to the vast diversity and uncultivated status of the majority of microorganisms, microbial detection, characterization, and quantitation are of great challenge. Although large-scale metagenome sequencing technology such as PCR-based amplicon sequencing has revolutionized the studies of microbial communities, it suffers from several inherent drawbacks, such as a high number of sequencing errors, biases, poor quantitation, and very high percentages of technical variations, which could greatly overestimate microbial biodiversity. Based on general sampling theory, this study provided the first explicit evidence to demonstrate the importance of random sampling processes in estimating microbial beta-diversity, which has not been adequately recognized and addressed in microbial ecology. Since most ecological studies are involved in random sampling, the conclusions learned from this study should also be applicable to other ecological studies in general. In summary, the results presented in this study should have important implications for examining microbial biodiversity to address both basic theoretical and applied management questions."
"Modern data science uses topological methods to find the structural features of data sets before further supervised or unsupervised analysis. Geometry and topology are very natural tools for analysing massive amounts of data since geometry can be regarded as the study of distance functions. Mathematical formalism, which has been developed for incorporating geometric and topological techniques, deals with point cloud data sets, i.e. finite sets of points. It then adapts tools from the various branches of geometry and topology for the study of point cloud data sets. The point clouds are finite samples taken from a geometric object, perhaps with noise. Topology provides a formal language for qualitative mathematics, whereas geometry is mainly quantitative. Thus, in topology, we study the relationships of proximity or nearness, without using distances. A map between topological spaces is called continuous if it preserves the nearness structures. Geometrical and topological methods are tools allowing us to analyse highly complex data. These methods create a summary or compressed representation of all of the data features to help to rapidly uncover particular patterns and relationships in data. The idea of constructing summaries of entire domains of attributes involves understanding the relationship between topological and geometric objects constructed from data using various features. A common thread in various approaches for noise removal, model reduction, feasibility reconstruction, and blind source separation, is to replace the original data with a lower dimensional approximate representation obtained via a matrix or multi-directional array factorization or decomposition. Besides those transformations, a significant challenge of feature summarization or subset selection methods for Big Data will be considered by focusing on scalable feature selection. Lower dimensional approximate representation is used for Big Data visualization. The cross-field between topology and Big Data will bring huge opportunities, as well as challenges, to Big Data communities. This survey aims at bringing together state-of-the-art research results on geometrical and topological methods for Big Data. (C) 2016 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier B.V."
"This paper describes the principles and theoretical investigations, supported by experimental measurements, aimed at designing and developing a novel mechatronic system for soil exploration, inspired by the apical part of the plant roots, named apex. Each single plant root has to move through the substrate, orienting itself along the gravity vector and locating water and nutrients. In the same way, the mechatronic apex can steer in all directions and it embeds a gravity sensor, a soil moisture gradient detector, as well as the electronics for sensory data acquisition and steering control. A bio-inspired algorithm reproducing the gravitropism and hydrotropism behaviors, typical of plants, was developed and tested on a purposive prototype of the mechatronic apex system, actuated by hydraulic pumps. Moreover, the design and testing of a novel bio-inspired osmotic actuator module, composed of three cells separated by couples of osmotic and ion-selective membranes, is also presented. Preliminary prototypes developed in acrylic material for testing the gravitropism and hydrotropism behaviors are shown."
"Monitoring ambient solar UVR levels provides information on how much there is in both real time and historically. Quality assurance of ambient measurements of solar UVR is critical to ensuring accuracy and stability and this can be achieved by regular intercomparisons of spectral measurement systems with those of other organizations. In October and November of 2013 a solar UVR spectroradiometer from Public Health England (PHE) was brought to Melbourne for a campaign of intercomparisons with a new Bentham spectrometer of Australian Radiation Protection and Nuclear Safety Agency (ARPANSA) and one at the Australian Bureau of Meteorology (BOM), supported by New Zealand's National Institute for Water and Atmosphere (NIWA). Given all three spectroradiometers have calibrations that are traceable to various national standards, the intercomparison provides a chance to determine measurement uncertainties and traceability that support UV measurement networks in Australia, New Zealand and the UK. UV Index measurements from all three systems were compared and ratios determined for clear sky conditions when the scans from each instrument were within 2min of each other. While wavelengths below 305nm showed substantial differences between the PHE unit and the two other systems, overall the intercomparison results were encouraging, with mean differences in measured UV Index between the BOM/NIWA and those of PHE and ARPANSA of <0.1% and 7.5%, respectively."
"Hidradenitis suppurativa (HS) is an inflammatory skin disease typically localized in the axillae and inguinal and perineal areas. In the absence of standardized medical treatment, severe HS patients present chronic suppurative lesions with polymicrobial anaerobic abscesses. Wide surgery is the cornerstone treatment of severe HS, but surgical indications are limited by the extent of lesions. Intravenous broad-spectrum antibiotics may help control HS, but their efficacy is not documented. This study was designed to assess the efficacy of a 6 week course of ertapenem (1 g daily) and of antibiotic consolidation treatments for 6 months (M6) in severe HS. Thirty consecutive patients with severe HS were retrospectively included in this study. The clinical severity of HS was assessed using the Sartorius score, which takes into account the number and severity of lesions. The median (IQR) Sartorius score dropped from 49.5 (28-62) at baseline to 19.0 (12-28) after ertapenem (PaEuroS < aEuroS10(-4)). Five patients were lost to follow-up thereafter. At M6 the Sartorius score further decreased for the 16 patients who received continuous consolidation treatments, since 59% of HS areas reached clinical remission at M6 (i.e. absence of any inflammatory symptoms, PaEuroS < aEuroS10(-4)). Nine patients interrupted or received intermittent consolidation treatments due to poor observance or irregular follow-up. Their Sartorius score stopped improving or returned to baseline. No major adverse event occurred. Ertapenem can dramatically improve severe HS. Consolidation treatments are needed to further improve HS and are mandatory to prevent relapses. Combined with surgery, optimized antibiotic treatments may be promising in severe HS."
"Background: Acquisition of drug-resistance in cancer has led to treatment failure, however, their mechanisms have not been clarified yet. Recent observations indicated that aberrant expressed microRNA (miRNA) caused by chromosomal alterations play a critical role in the initiation and progression of cancer. Here, we performed an integrated genomic analysis combined with array-based comparative hybridization, miRNA, and gene expression microarray to elucidate the mechanism of drug-resistance. Results: Through genomic approaches in MCF7-ADR; a drug-resistant breast cancer cell line, our results reflect the unique features of drug-resistance, including MDR1 overexpression via genomic amplification and miRNA-mediated TP53INP1 down-regulation. Using a gain of function study with 12 miRNAs whose expressions were down-regulated and genome regions were deleted, we show that miR-505 is a novel tumor suppressive miRNA and inhibits cell proliferation by inducing apoptosis. We also find that Akt3, correlate inversely with miR-505, modulates drug sensitivity in MCF7-ADR. Conclusion: These findings indicate that various genes and miRNAs orchestrate to temper the drug-resistance in cancer cells, and thus acquisition of drug-resistance is intricately controlled by genomic status, gene and miRNA expression changes."
"This study examines the mechanisms through which the ruling party won a plurality of votes using a combination of legal changes and manipulative practices during the 2012 parliamentary election in Ukraine. Legal changes in electoral rulesthe replacement of proportional representation to a mixed systemhelped the ruling party weaken the opposition parties. These changes enabled the ruling party to engage in manipulation and fraud during campaigning and on election day by suppressing competition, crowding out the races with technical parties and clone candidates, and manipulating the composition of electoral commissions. The change of electoral system also enabled outright fraud on election day. A combination of these techniques disrupted both the contestation and participation dimensions of democracy, effectively pushing Ukraine into a state of competitive authoritarianism."
"In many cities of the world, road space is increasingly contested. Growing vehicle numbers, traffic calming and the development of new infrastructure for more sustainable transport modes such as bicycles have all contributed to pressure on available space and conflicts over the allocation of space. This paper provides the first assessment of urban transport infrastructure space distribution, distinguishing motorized individual transport, public transport, cycling and walking. To calculate area allocation, an assessment methodology was developed using high-resolution digital satellite images in combination with a geographical information system to derive area measurements. This methodology was applied to four distinctly different city quarters in Freiburg, Germany. Results indicate that space is unevenly distributed, with motorized individual transport being the favoured transport mode. Findings also show that if trip number to space allocation ratios are calculated, one of the most sustainable transport modes, the bicycle, is the most disadvantaged. This suggests that area allocation deserves greater attention in the planning and implementation of more sustainable urban transport designs."
"The anisotropy of Mg alloy is investigated using uniaxial compression experiments. The anisotropic behaviors of interest include the texture, deformed shape, constitutive relationship, and fracture characteristics, and all of them are related to the microscopic mechanisms which include the competition between twinning and slipping at different temperatures and strain rates. When the loading is perpendicular to the c-axis of the HCP lattice, the specimen yields at a low stress because twinning is favored at relatively low strain, the deformed shape is strongly anisotropic owing to the slipping at high stress along (1 1 (2) over bar 3), and fracture occurs along (1 1 (2) over bar 3). On the other hand, when the loading is parallel to c-axis, there is no twinning process and the plastic deformation is dominated by slipping which requires higher stress, the yield stress is higher, and the deformation is isotropic. Anisotropy is also more prominent upon lower temperature or higher strain rate, largely thanks to twinning. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."
"Investigation of the redox status in the cerebral circulation is of great importance in order to evaluate intensity of oxidative stress-related diseases and the corresponding therapeutic effects. Changes in levels of reduced glutathione (GSH) are a major indicator of oxidative stress conditions. However, an important limitation for measurement of GSH as a biomarker is the possible presence in samples of gamma-glutamyltransferase (GGT) activity, i.e., the enzyme catalysing GSH breakdown. An accurate assay for the measurement of GSH in rat brain microvessels was developed, taking into account the high GOT activity expressed in this tissue compartment. Based on a sensitive fluorescence-based microtiter plate method using 2,3-naphthalenedicarboxyaldehyde as GSH-selective fluorogenic probe, the assay was applied to brain microvessels isolated from individual male Wistar rats. Pooling of microvessel fractions from several animals, as required by other procedures, could thus be avoided. In order to prevent GSH consumption via GGT activity, serine-boric acid complex (SBC) was added as inhibitor all along the microvessels isolation process. In the absence of GOT inhibition GSH in isolated brain microvessels was below the limit of quantification. Addition of SBC almost completely suppressed GOT activity, thus allowing GSH quantification (4.4 +/- 1.6 nmol.mg(-1) protein, n=3). Following the administration of a GSH depletor (diethyl maleate, 1 g.kg(-1) i.p.), decreased GSH levels were measured in liver, brain tissue and brain microvessels as well, thus confirming the reliability of the method for safe GSH measurements in small-sized, individual samples presenting high GOT activity.

"Recent studies suggest the use of microwave energy in activated carbon (AC) production emphasizing efficiency specifically in the pyrolysis step as it can significantly reduce heating time compared to conventional furnaces. However, there is no documented effort on the effect of the activating chemical agent on microwave heating dynamics and its impact on pyrolysis time despite its importance for efficiency on both technical and economic aspects of the process. Elucidating the heating rate of H3PO4-activated biomass under microwave energy is one of the objectives of the research while the ultimate goal is to find practical H3PO4 concentration for chemical activation of biomass precursors in obtaining optimum AC yield and textural characteristics. It was found that excessive H3PO4 has a negative effect of slowing down pyrolysis time as it promotes poor microwave absorption on the biomassH3PO4 complex. In addition, H3PO4 undergoing conversion to its anhydride, P2O5, requires relatively high activation energy, and its conversion may possibly cause extended pyrolysis time. Numerical optimization revealed chemical activation at 56.50% H(3)P(O)4, and pyrolysis under 650 W microwave power is a rational balance in terms of maximizing yield and surface area while minimizing activating agents and microwave energy. Under these conditions, a pyrolysis time of around 30 min, yield at around 39.65 wt %, and surface area of 826.38 m2/g can be expected. However, surface area can be as high as 1726.5 m2/g but will require 84.83% H3PO4 on activation, about 803.75 W power and 48 min carbonization time."
"Ciprofloxacin (CIP) adsorption on montmorillonite was investigated using structurally related probing compounds phenylpiperazine (PP) and fluorochloroquinolone carboxylic acid (FCQCA). Desorption of the equivalent amounts of exchangeable cations accompanying PP and CIP adsorption on montmorillonite suggested that cation exchange was the major adsorption mechanism for the CIP adsorption under acidic to neutral conditions, and the piperazine amine group was responsible for the cation exchange interaction. In contrast, the adsorption of CIP and FCQCA on montmorillonite indicated that hydrogen bonding between the keto carbonyl group and coordinated water in the interlayer of montmorillonite was mainly responsible for the CIP adsorption in alkaline aqueous solution as evidenced by Fourier transform infrared analyses. X-ray diffraction analyses demonstrated that both cation exchange and hydrogen bonding between the keto carbonyl group and coordinated water lead to the intercalation of CIP in montmorillonite."
"The study of Ebola virus (EBOV) pathogenesis in vivo has been limited to nonhuman primate models or use of an adapted virus to cause disease in rodent models. Herein we describe wild-type EBOV (Makona variant) infection of mice engrafted with human hematopoietic CD34(+) stem cells (Hu-NSG (TM)-SGM3 mice; hereafter referred to as SGM3 HuMice). SGM3 HuMice support increased development of myeloid immune cells, which are primary EBOV targets. In SGM3 HuMice, EBOV replicated to high levels, and disease was observed following either intraperitoneal or intramuscular inoculation. Despite the high levels of viral antigen and inflammatory cell infiltration in the liver, the characteristic histopathology of Ebola virus disease was not observed, and this absence of severe immunopathology may have contributed to the recovery and survival of some of the animals. Future investigations into the underlying mechanisms of the atypical disease presentation in SGM3 HuMice will provide additional insights into the immunopathogenesis of severe EBOV disease."
"Here we present combined radioisotopic dating (U-Pb zircon) and cyclostratigraphic analysis of the carbon isotope excursion at the Paleocene-Eocene (P-E) boundary in Spitsbergen to determine the numerical age of the boundary. Incorporating the total uncertainty from both radioisotopic and cyclostratigraphic data sets gives an age ranging from 55.728 to 55.964 Ma, within error of a recently proposed astronomical age of similar to 55.93 Ma. Combined with the assumption that the Paleocene Epoch spans twenty-five 405 kyr cycles, our new age for the boundary suggests an age of similar to 66 Ma for the Cretaceous-Paleogene boundary. Furthermore, our P-E boundary age is consistent with the hypothesis that the onset of the Paleocene-Eocene thermal maximum at the boundary occurred on the falling limb of a 405 kyr cycle, suggesting the event was initiated by a different mechanism to that which triggered the other early Eocene hyperthermals."
"The energy management of office buildings has been a rising concern for owners, researchers, and energy suppliers. The volatility of power load in office buildings threatens energy consumption and risks device security. This paper investigates the load fluctuation patterns in an office building based on user data, using recurrence interval analysis for different thresholds. The recurrence intervals of volatility are fitted by stretched exponential distribution, from which the probability density function is derived. Then, the short-term and long-term memory effect on the fluctuations are learned by conditional probability density function and multifractal detrended fluctuation analysis, respectively. A hazard function is further established to analyze the risk estimation of load volatility and derive the value at risk (VaR). Thus, a functional relationship has been established between average recurrence interval and threshold. The methodology and analysis results addressed in this paper help to understand load fluctuation patterns and aid in the design of energy consumption strategies in office buildings. According to the results of our research, conclusions and management suggestions are provided at the end of this paper."
An optimal path synthesis problem for a moving observer that performs angular observations over a target moving uniformly along a straight line on a plane is solved. It is supposed that elevation and azimuth angles can be observed when the observer moves in space and only the azimuth angle can be observed when the observer moves on a plane. Observer's trajectories are obtained with the help of Pontryagin's maximum principle as numerical solutions of an optimal control problem. As a performance criterion the trace of covariance matrix of the target motion elements estimate is used. A possibility of solving the problem in real time on board for unmanned aerial vehicle is investigated. A comparison with the scenario of two unmanned aerial vehicles using is given.
"Laccases are oxidative enzymes related to the degradation of phenolic compounds, including lignin units, with concomitant reduction of oxygen to water. Delignification is a necessary pretreatment step in the process of converting plant biomass into fermentable sugars. The objective of this work was to optimize the production of laccases and to evaluate the delignification of sugarcane bagasse by Pleurotus ostreatus in solid-state fermentation. Among eight variables (pH, water activity, temperature, and concentrations of CuSO4, (NH4)(2)SO4, KH2PO4, asparagine, and yeast extract), copper sulfate and ammonium sulfate concentrations were demonstrated to significantly influence laccase production. The replacement of ammonium sulfate by yeast extract and the addition of ferulic acid as inducer provided increases of 5.7- and 2.0-fold, respectively, in laccase activity. Optimization of laccase production as a function of yeast extract, copper sulfate, and ferulic acid concentrations was performed by response surface methodology and optimal concentrations were 6.4 g/L, 172.6 mu M, and 1.86 mM, respectively. Experimentally, the maximum laccase activity of 151.6 U/g was produced at the 5th day of solid-state fermentation. Lignin content in sugarcane bagasse was reduced from 31.89% to 26.36% after 5 days and to 20.79% after 15 days by the biological treatment of solid-state fermentation."
"Rare earth solution (RES) surface modification and acid treatment methods were used to functionalize carbon nanotubes (CNTs). CNT composite thin films were prepared on hydroxylated glass substrates by a self-assembling process from specially formulated solution. Atomic force microscopy, x-ray photoelectron spectrometry, and scanning electron microscopy were used to characterize the thin films. Tribological properties of the CNT thin films sliding against a steel ball were evaluated on a friction and wear tester. The experimental results showed that the friction coefficient of the glass substrate was reduced from 0.85 to 0.1 after the formation of CNT composite self-assembled film on its surface, and the film exhibited good wear resistant property. The superior friction reduction and wear resistance of CNT composite films were attributed to the improvement of load-bearing capacity afforded by the chemical bond between CNTs and the films as well as good adhesion of the films to the substrate."
"Alzheimer disease (AD), the most common dementing disorder, is a multifactorial disease with complex etiology. Among different hypotheses proposed for AD one of the most corroborated is the ""oxidative stress hypothesis"". Although recent studies extensively demonstrated the specific oxidative modification of selected proteins in the brain of AD patients and how their dysfunction possibly correlates with the pathology, there is still an urgent need to extend these findings to peripheral tissue. So far very few studies showed oxidative damage of proteins in peripheral tissues and current findings need to be replicated. Another limit in AD research is represented by the lack of highly specific diagnostic tools for early diagnosis. For a full screening and early diagnosis, biomarkers easily detectable in biological samples, such as blood, are needed. The search of reliable biomarkers for AD in peripheral blood is a great challenge. A few studies described a set of plasma markers that differentiated AD from controls and were shown to be useful in predicting conversion from mild cognitive impairment, which is considered a prodromal stage, to AD. We review the current state of knowledge on peripheral oxidative biomarkers for AD, including proteomics, which might be useful for early diagnosis and prognosis. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

"The diffraction limit sets the smallest achievable linewidth at half the wavelength. With a subwavelength plasmonic lens allowing one to reduce the diffraction via an asymmetry and to generate and squeeze the wave functions, an incident light is focused by the aperture to a single line with its width smaller than the limited value in the intermediate zone. The focused fields are capable of propagating in free space. This light focusing process, besides being of academic interest, is expected to open up a wide range of application possibilities.

"In this study an Artificial Neural Network called Self-Organizing Map (SOM) is used in order to classify the synoptic circulation over Europe and especially Eastern Mediterranean. The classification of circulation types is an effective way of summarizing and describing the atmospheric circulation and it is useful in climatology because it provides a better understanding of the climatic variability over an area. Here, the SOM methodology is applied on winter daily geopotential height anomalies of the 500 hPa level, for the period 1971-2000. Twelve unique circulation patterns are identified. Eight of these types are characterized as cyclonic, representing 61% of the total days examined and four types are characterized as anticyclonic, representing 39% of the study period. The results of this classification are comparable to other objective classifications applied on the same study region and present a similar image. Therefore, the SOM methodology is found to be applicable and useful in the classification of circulation types."
"EnBW Energie Baden-Wurttemberg AG is continuously improving their processes. On this way, the treatment of manually measured structural data of dams and barrages has been changed from manual digitization to an acquisition using a self-developed measurement data app for Apple iPad. The system is currently used for measuring approximately 500 points according to a location-dependent cycle. The EnBW measurement data app complies with the restrictive company security requirements. Furthermore, personal data or time stamps have been adapted in a way that movement profiles cannot be generated. After nearly two years of operation, we can see a clear success: the documentation is standardized and data is available faster. Additional measuring points and dam locations can be added using an Excel-file easily. A further step is the implementation of the compiled data in the EnBW operational management tool CoRA (Cockpit for Renewable Assets)."
"Aim Changes in glucose levels during labor have not been sufficiently investigated in pregnant women. Using real-time continuous glucose monitoring, we aimed to assess glucose kinetics during labor among pregnant women with gestational diabetes mellitus (PwGDM), and those with normal glucose tolerance (PwNGT). Methods Japanese PwGDM and PwNGT who had planned a transvaginal delivery at Okayama University Hospital were enrolled. The correlation between changes in glucose levels during labor among the PwGDM and PwNGT groups at four time periods was assessed: (i) active phase of 1st stage of labor; (ii) 2nd stage of labor; (iii) postpartum 0-12 h; and (iv) postpartum 12-48 h. Results In total, 18 and 22 PwGDM and PwNGT, respectively, were enrolled. During labor, both groups had similar changes in glucose levels over time, which peaked during period 3. The main effect of glucose level changes was the labor period (P < 0.001), not the presence of gestational diabetes mellitus. Furthermore, differences in glucose levels in the PwGDM group were observed between periods 1 and 2 (P = 0.037), 1 and 3 (P = 0.024), 3 and 4 (P = 0.005); differences in glucose levels in the PwNGT group were observed between periods 3 and 4 (P = 0.024). Conclusion During labor, both PwGDM and PwNGT groups showed similar changes in glucose levels over time. During delivery, the PwGDM who regularly measured their own glucose levels could be managed using the same nutritional management methods as those for PwNGT."
"Laboratory experiments have established that many of the materials comprising the Earth are strongly anisotropic in terms of seismic-wave speeds(1). Observations of azimuthal(2,3) and radial(4,5) anisotropy in the upper mantle are attributed to the lattice-preferred orientation of olivine caused by the shear strains associated with deformation, and provide some of the most direct evidence for deformation and flow within the Earth's interior. Although observations of crustal radial anisotropy would improve our understanding of crustal deformation and flow patterns resulting from tectonic processes, large-scale observations have been limited to regions of particularly thick crust(6). Here we show that observations from ambient noise tomography in the western United States reveal strong deep (middle to lower)-crustal radial anisotropy that is confined mainly to the geological provinces that have undergone significant extension during the Cenozoic Era (since similar to 65 Myr ago)(7,8). The coincidence of crustal radial anisotropy with the extensional provinces of the western United States suggests that the radial anisotropy results from the lattice-preferred orientation of anisotropic crustal minerals caused by extensional deformation. These observations also provide support for the hypothesis that the deep crust within these regions has undergone widespread and relatively uniform strain in response to crustal thinning and extension(9-11)."
"The objective of this study was to determine whether limit-fed heifers will choose to consume long particles, rather than short, of a low-nutritive feedstuff to ameliorate rumen function and meet foraging needs. Ten Holstein heifers 261.6 +/- 39.2 (mean +/- SD) d of age were exposed to each of 2 dietary treatments, in a random order, over 2 successive 7-d treatment periods (4-d adaptation period and a 3-d data collection period) using a crossover design. The treatments were (1) a provision of long particle oat straw (85% of particles > 8 mm; LS) and (2) provision of short particle oat straw (45% of particles >8 mm; SS). Both treatments were offered following consumption of a limit-fed, nutrient-dense total mixed ration fed at 2.05% of body weight. Following each 7-d period, heifers were given access to both types of straw during an additional 2-d preference period; individual intakes were recorded daily. Feeding and lying behavior were recorded during the last 3 d of each treatment period. Ruminal temperature was recorded during the last 3 d of each treatment period using a telemetric acquisition system and rumen boluses. Dry matter intake of both the total mixed ration (6.3 kg/d) and straw (0.36 kg/d) was similar between treatments. Heifers fed LS spent more time feeding (197.7 vs. 175.2 min/d) throughout the day than heifers fed SS due to the increase in time required to consume long particles in the LS (59.8 vs. 34.2 min/d). Daily lying time (974.7 min/d) and time spent standing without eating (278.9 min/d) was similar between treatments. The preference period showed a strong preference ratio for LS rather than SS (preference ratio = 0.83), with heifers consuming 0 43 +/- 0.2 kg/d of LS and 0.07 +/- 0.1 kg/d of SS (mean +/- SD). Heifers maintained similar mean (38.3 degrees C), minimum (35.1 degrees C), and maximum (38.9 degrees C) rumen temperature across treatments. The amount of time that rumen temperature was elevated over 38.6 degrees C, 39.0 degrees C, and 39.4 degrees C was similar between treatments. In conclusion, heifers will consume similar amounts of supplementary long or short straw if provided to them alongside of a limit-fed TMR. Limit-fed heifers do, however, show a clear preference for LS when offered the choice, suggesting that they find LS to be more satisfactory for achieving rumen fill or meeting their behavioral foraging needs."
"Starting by King's method, we propose a modified families of fourth- and eighth-order of convergence iterative methods for nonlinear equations. The fourth-order method requires at each iteration three function evaluations, while the eighth-order methods both need four function evaluations. The proposed methods are derivative-free. Based on the conjecture of Kung and Traub, the new methods attain the optimality with efficiency index 1.587 for the fourth-order method and 1.68 for the eighth-order methods. The convergence analyses of the methods are given, and comparisons with some well-known schemes having identical order of convergence demonstrate the efficiency of the present techniques.

"This paper draws on my own recent experience of local artistic engagement with the British government's counter-terrorism strategy, Prevent(ing Violent Extremism). Not in My Name uses verbatim theatre techniques to negotiate dialogue within and across communities around a controversial agenda, and has received national acclaim for its innovative response to a pressing political concern. Revisiting Theodor Adorno's fluctuating pronouncements on the dialectical tension between the inadequacy and yet indispensability of culture beyond Auschwitz, this paper explores the creative and ethical dilemmas embedded within a contemporary artistic response to recent terrorist atrocity. Through examining both the moral responsibilities of community engagement and the ambiguities of theatrical representation in relation to acts of remembered rather than imagined terror, this paper highlights the shared vulnerabilities of precipitated interaction between commissioned artists and audiences deemed 'at risk' of potential radicalisation. The paper consequently argues for further consideration to be given to the development of an appropriate ethical dimension to support and challenge the aesthetic choices of artists engaging directly with Prevent or other comparable counter-terrorism agendas."
"Heating, ventilating and air-conditioning (HVAC) systems are typical non-linear time-variable multivariate systems with disturbances and uncertainties. In this paper, an approach based on a combined neuro-fuzzy model for dynamic and automatic regulation of indoor temperature is proposed. The proposed artificial neural network performs indoor temperatures forecasts that are used to feed a fuzzy logic control unit in order to manage the on/off switching of the HVAC system and the regulation of the inlet air speed. Moreover, the used neural network is optimized by the analytical calculation of the embedding parameters, and the goodness of this approach is tested through MATLAB. The fuzzy controller is driven by the indoor temperature forecasted by the neural network module and is able to adjust the membership functions dynamically, since thermal comfort is a very subjective factor and may vary even in the same subject. The paper shows some experimental results, through a real implementation in an embedded prototyping board, of the proposed approach in terms of the evolution of the inlet air speed injected by the fan coils, the indoor air temperature forecasted by the neural network model and the adjusting of the membership functions after receiving user feedback."
"Drawing on a rich tradition of anacreontic poetry and taking inspiration from works by Nizm and Hfiz, the sq-nma or cupbearer's song emerged as an independent genre in the early sixteenth century and flourished throughout the Persian literary world for the next 250 years. Looking back on the development of the genre, the early seventeenth-century literary historians Abd al-Nab Qazvn and Awhad Balyn give contrasting accounts of its formation, but both agree on the significance of the work of Hakm Partuv Shrz (d. 928/1520-21). An examination of his sq-nma, together with two other early representatives of the genre by Sidq Astarbd (d. 952/1545) and Sharaf Jahn Qazvn (d. 968/1561), shows how closely this new genre was tied to the politics and ideology of the new Safavid state and reveals profound structural similarities to the preeminent panegyric genre of the Islamicate world, the qasda. But once the basic components of the sq-nm were distilled and taken up by poets outside this socio-political environment, the genre proved to be as protean as the wine symbolism at its core. Cupbearer songs from the end of the century, particularly those of Muhammad Sf Mzandarn (d. 1035/1625-26) and Sanjar Kshn (d. 1021/1612), show how the basic elements of the genre could be reconfigured to serve a variety of more personal interests."
"We determined the concentrations of 10 metals (Fe, Mn, Zn, Cu, Cd, Pb, Cr, Ni, V, and Tl in surface sediments collected from eight outlets of the Pearl River from 2012 to 2016, and then used radar charts, Pearson correlations, principal component analysis (PCA), the geo-accumulation index (I-geo) and enrichment factor (EF) to analyze the concentrations. The average concentrations of the elements decreased in the order Fe > Mn > Zn > V > Cu > Cr > Pb > Ni > Cd > Tl. Among them, copper concentrations have increased continuously in the Jitimen outlet over the last 5 years, newly forming a Cu hot spot. The I-geo and EF indexes showed that Cd caused most contamination, with sediments classed as moderately to extremely polluted, and that the other metals caused either no or moderate pollution. According to the sources and distribution patterns, the examined metals fell into four groups when the comprehensive analyses were combined; Group 1 (Zn, Cd, Pb, and Mn); group 2 (Cr, Ni, and Cu); group 3 (Fe and V); and group 4 (Tl). Local governments should pay attention on preventing Cd risk on local ecosystem and controlling of Cu discharges to Jitimen outlet."
"In this paper we develop tools for the analysis of net subdivision schemes, schemes which recursively refine nets of bivariate continuous functions defined on grids of lines, and generate denser and denser nets. Sufficient conditions for the convergence of such a sequence of refined nets, and for the smoothness of the limit function, are derived in terms of proximity to a bivariate linear subdivision scheme refilling points, under conditions controlling some aspects of the univariate functions of the generated nets. Approximation orders of net subdivision schemes, which are in proximity with positive schemes refining points are also derived. The paper concludes with the construction of a family of blending spline-type net subdivision schemes, and with their analysis by the tools presented in the paper. This family is a new example of net subdivision schemes generating C-1 limits with approximation order 2. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."
"As part of the security within distributed systems, various services and resources need protection from unauthorized use. Remote authentication is the most commonly used method to determine the identity of a remote client. This paper investigates a systematic approach for authenticating clients by three factors, namely password, smart card, and biometrics. A generic and secure framework is proposed to upgrade two-factor authentication to three-factor authentication. The conversion not only significantly improves the information assurance at low cost but also protects client privacy in distributed systems. In addition, our framework retains several practice-friendly properties of the underlying two-factor authentication, which we believe is of independent interest."
"A 48-year-old man with a history of myopic laser in situ keratomileusis (LASIK) had selective laser trabeculoplasty (SLT) for the treatment of glaucoma in the right eye. He subsequently developed grade 2 diffuse lamellar keratitis (DLK). He then elected to have SLT in the left eye and developed grade 1 DLK. To our knowledge, this is the first report of bilateral consecutive late postoperative DLK following SLT after LASIK."
"Novel selective histone deacetylase 6 (HDAC6) inhibitors using the quinazoline as the cap were designed, synthesized, and evaluated for HDAC enzymatic assays. N-Hydroxy-4-(2-methoxy-5-(methyl(2-methylquinazolin-4-yl)-amino)phenoxy)butanamide, 23bb, was the most potent selective inhibitor for HDAC6 with an IC50 of 17 nM and showed 25-fold and 200-fold selectivity relative to HDAC1 and HDAC8, respectively. In vitro, 23bb presented low nanomolar antiproliferative effects against panel of cancer cell lines. Western blot analysis further confirmed that 23bb increased acetylation level of a-tubulin in vitro. 23bb has a good pharmacokinetic profile with oral bioavailability of 47.0% in rats. In in vivo efficacy evaluations of colorectal HCT116, acute myelocytic leukemia MV4-11, and B cell lymphoma Romas xenografts, 23bb more effectively inhibited the tumor growth than SAI-IA even at a 4-fold reduced dose or ACY-1215 at the same dose. Our results indicated that 23bb is a potent oral anticancer candidate for selective HDAC6 inhibitor and deserves further investigation."
"Dengue fever is known to be one of the most common arthropod-borne viral infectious diseases of public health importance. The disease is now endemic in more than 100 countries in Africa, the Americas, the Eastern Mediterranean, Southeast Asia and the Western Pacific with an estimated two fifths of the world's population being at risk. The notable endemic viral hemorrhagic fevers (VHFs) found in West Africa, including yellow fever, Lassa fever, Rift Valley fever, dengue fever and until recently Ebola have been responsible for most outbreaks with fatal consequences. These VHFs usually produce unclear acute febrile illness, especially in the acute phase of infection. In this study we detected the presence of 2 different serotypes (DENV-2 and DENV-3) of Dengue virus in 4 sera of 150 patients clinically suspected of Ebola virus disease during the Ebola Virus Disease (EVD) outbreak in West Africa with the use of serological and molecular test assays. Sequence data was successfully generated for DENV-3 and phylogenetic analysis of the envelope gene showed that the DENV-3 sequences had close homology with DENV-3 sequences from Senegal and India. This study documents molecular evidence of an indigenous Dengue fever viral infection in Ghana and therefore necessitates the need to have an efficient surveillance system to rapidly detect and control the dissemination of the different serotypes in the population which has the potential to cause outbreaks of dengue hemorrhagic fevers."
"STUDY DESIGN: Randomized, controlled, crossover trial. OBJECTIVES: To examine the effects of elastic therapeutic taping (ETT) applied to the lumbar paraspinal region on back muscle endurance (BME) compared to no tape or a rigid therapeutic taping (RTT) procedure in individuals with nonspecific low back pain. BACKGROUND: Elastic therapeutic taping is an increasingly popular intervention for clinicians who treat patients with low back pain. However, no studies have investigated the effect of ETT on back extensor muscle performance in a symptomatic population. METHODS: We measured BME in 16 patients (mean +/- SD age, 44.8 +/- 10.4 years; 44% female) with nonspecific low back pain. Back muscle endurance was measured using the Biering-Sorensen test under 3 different conditions: ETT, no tape, and RTT. For the ETT condition, the tape was applied over the paraspinal muscles according to the Kinesio Tex taping protocol. The RTT condition consisted of the same tape configuration but using nonelastic athletic tape. All participants received each testing condition in random order, with 1 to 3 days between each condition. Differences in BME between the 3 testing conditions were explored with repeated-measures analyses of variance. RESULTS: There were no differences in BME between ETT and RTT, or between the RTT and no-tape conditions. The difference in BME between the ETT and no-tape conditions was statistically significant (mean difference, 20.7 seconds; 95% confidence interval: 6.8, 34.5; P = .006) but within the threshold of measurement error. CONCLUSION: Back muscle endurance was higher with ETT applied over the paraspinal musculature when compared to a no-tape condition. However, the magnitude of difference did not exceed measurement error. There was no difference in BME when using elastic or rigid therapeutic tape."
"BTF3, which was originally recognized as a basal transcription factor, has been known to be involved in transcription initiation, translational regulation and protein localization in many eukaryotic organisms. However, its function remains largely unknown in plant species. In the present study, we analyzed a BTF3-related sequence in Oryza sativa L. subsp. japonica, which shares the conserved domain of a nascent polypeptide-associated complex with human BTF3, and was referred to as Osj10gBTF3. The expression of Osj10gBTF3 was primarily constitutive and generally modulated by salt, high temperature and exogenous phytohormone stress. The Osj10gBTF3::EGFP (enhanced green fluorescence protein) fusion protein was localized in both the nucleus and cytoplasmic membrane system. Inhibition of Osj10gBTF3 led to significant morphological changes in all detected tissues and organs, with a reduced size of between 25% and 52%. Furthermore, the pollen that developed was completely sterile, which was correlated with the altered expression of two Rf (fertility restorer)-like genes that encode pentatricopeptide repeat-containing proteins OsPPR676 and OsPPR920, translational initiation factors OseIF3e and OseIF3h, and the heat shock protein OsHSP82. These findings were verified through a yeast two-hybrid assay using a Nipponbare callus cDNA library as bait followed by the reverse transcription-PCR analysis of total leaf or anther RNAs. Our demonstration of the important role of Osj10gBTF3 in rice growth and development provides new insights showing that more complex regulatory functions are associated with BTF3 in plants."
"Rationale: The management of complete obstruction of anastomosis following colorectal surgery is challenging. Some modified minimally invasive methods have been reported to be successfully implemented in some cases. In this case report, we present a case to share our experience. Patient concerns: A 64-year-old man underwent low anterior resection and single barrel ileostomy for rectal cancer 5 months ago. Completely obstructed anastomotic stenosis was found during colonoscopy. Diagnosis: Colonoscopy showed the anastomosis at 8cm from the anal verge was completely obstructed. Interventions: A small incision was made by a needle knife, and then the stenosis was sequentially dilated by using a wire-guided balloon dilator. Outcomes: The luminal continuity was reestablished. The patient underwent successful ileostomy closure 2 months later. At 18-months follow-up, no restenosis of the anastomosis was observed during colonoscopy. Lessons: Endoscopic small incision with a needle knife along with balloon dilation could be an alternative method for patients with complete obstruction of anastomosis after colorectal resection. But this procedure should be performed with great caution in selected patients and performed only by highly experienced endoscopists."
"We show that, when the double bootstrap is used to improve performance of bootstrap methods for bias correction, techniques based on using a single double-bootstrap sample for each single-bootstrap sample can produce third-order accuracy for much less computational expense than is required by conventional double-bootstrap methods. However, this improved level of performance is not available for the single double-bootstrap methods that have been suggested to construct confidence intervals or distribution estimators."
"Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia is an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by vascular malformations, and many clinical complications are related to pulmonary arteriovenous malformations (PAVMs) because they provide direct right-to-left shunts. Paradoxical emboli through these shunts are a well-recognized cause of transient ischemic attack, stroke, and cerebral abscess. The aim of this study was to determine whether paradoxical emboli through PAVMs could manifest as cardiac ischemic events. The study included a single-center population of 98 patients with PAVMs. Eighty-four had undergone PAVM embolotherapy, and the remaining 14 patients had PAVMs too small to require embolization. Patients were interviewed by telephone and surveyed regarding their cardiopulmonary symptoms and histories of cardiac diagnoses. We found that 6 patients (which is 18% of patients with symptomatic PAVMs, n = 33, and 6% of the total cohort, n = 98) reported that they had experienced typical angina pectoris-like chest pain or had a myocardial infarction before PAVM embolotherapy. Five patients had had a cardiac catheterization, 4 had normal coronary arteries, and 1 had a single artery occlusion. In conclusion, we suggest that in patients with untreated PAVMs, cardiac ischemia can occur because of a paradoxical embolus through PAVMs to a coronary artery. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

"A number of studies have examined the risk factors for Osgood-Schlatter disease (OSD). Studies on risk factors have not necessarily accurately demonstrated the risk factors of this disease because they were not prospective cohort studies or the populations in the studies were not categorized by the skeletal maturation of the tibial tuberosity. We can identify the precise risk factors for OSD by performing a prospective cohort study of a group of asymptomatic patients in particular times of adolescent using ultrasonography. In the present study, we aimed to investigate the precise risk factors for OSD. For all examinations, we used a 3-stage classification for tibial tuberosity development observed on ultrasonography: sonolucent (stage S), individual (stage I), and connective stages (stage C). Among 150 players with 300 knees, we included 37 male players with 70 knees at asymptomatic stage I on the first examination. We re-examined the included knees 1 year after the first examination and compared 10 knees with OSD (OSD group) and 60 knees without OSD (control group). Height, body weight, body mass index, tightness of the quadriceps femoris and hamstring muscles, muscle strength during knee extension, and flexion were assessed during the first medical examination. The incidence of OSD was 14.3 % in this 1-year cohort study. A significant difference was found in body weight, quadriceps muscle tightness, and muscle tightness and strength during knee extension between the 2 groups. The precise risk factors for OSD were increased, namely the quadriceps femoris muscle tightness and strength during knee extension and flexibility of the hamstring muscles, using logistic regression analysis. This information may be useful for teaching quadriceps stretching in preadolescent male football players with stage I."
"The delamination of oxygen electrode during the electrolysis mode operation, which is mainly attributed to interfacial stress arising from the inability of oxygen electrode to accommodate oxygen species transported by oxide ion conducting electrolyte at the three phase boundary (TPB), has been major concern in the development of reversible solid oxide cell (RSOC) systems. The use of lanthanum nickelate, La2NiO4+delta (LNO) as a RSOC oxygen electrode, because of its ability to accommodate excess oxygen species in interstitial positions, can be helpful in reliving such interfacial stresses and thus mitigating the problem of delamination. In this work, the possibility of using LNO as an oxygen electrode in RSOCs is examined. The button cells with 10% gadolinium doped ceria (GDC10) electrolyte, Ni-GDC10 fuel electrode and LNO oxygen electrode are fabricated and their current-voltage-power (I-V-P) performance is analyzed in different gas conditions while operating in fuel cell mode in 500-650 degrees C range. The button cell shows a maximum power density of similar to 0.19 W cm(-2) at a current density of similar to 0.5 A cm(-2) at 650 degrees C. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy was performed in open circuit voltage (OCV) condition to analyze the various factors affecting the fuel cell performance. The long term operation of the fuel cell at a fixed input current of 0.1 A cm(-2) for 100 h at 600 degrees C indicates that the fuel cell is capable of stable performance.

"PURPOSE. To compare the ability of circumpapillary retinal nerve fiber layer (cpRNFL) thickness and macular parameters obtained by three spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) instruments to detect highly myopic glaucoma. METHODS. In this study, 84 glaucomatous eyes, 53 normal eyes with high myopia, and 86 normal eyes (not highly myopic) were enrolled. Each participant was imaged using Cirrus, RTVue, and 3D OCT to evaluate the average and quadrant cpRNFL thicknesses. The macular retinal nerve fiber layer (mRNFL), ganglion cell layer + inner plexiform layer (GCL/IPL), and mRNFL + GCL/IPL (GCC) thicknesses were analyzed. The areas under the receiver operating characteristic curves (AUCs) were compared between the instruments. In addition, the best parameters for the AUC were compared between the cpRNFL parameters and macular parameters in each instrument. RESULTS. These analyses revealed similar AUCs for the average cpRNFL and GCC thicknesses between the instruments. RTVue displayed a significantly higher AUC in the nasal cpRNFL thickness than both Cirrus (P = 0.0004) and 3D OCT (P = 0.0006). 3D OCT showed higher AUCs than Cirrus in the mRNFL parameters. There were no significant differences between the best cpRNFL parameters and macular parameters in each instrument. CONCLUSIONS. The average cpRNFL and GCC thicknesses that were measured using these OCT instruments exhibited similar abilities for diagnosing highly myopic glaucoma, and RTVue exhibited better diagnostic abilities than Cirrus and 3D OCT for nasal cpRNFL. 3D OCT had better ability than Cirrus in the mRNFL. Both cpRNFL and GCC in each instrument were comparable, and their measurements offered good ability for diagnosing glaucoma with high myopia. (http://www.umin.ac.jp/ctr/index/htm9, UMIN000006900.)"
"Tearing properties of textiles has drawn much attention due to recent applications to bullet-proof or explosion proof vests. However, the tearing process is very complex, which is influenced by bulk material and geometrical factors as well, and there is no a matured theory for the tearing process, which limits optimal design of the textiles. Despite many experimental studies, we still lack fully understanding of the tearing process. In this paper, tearing properties of textiles with Steiner tree structure are studied experimentally and theoretically in order to develop a reliable mathematical model. The theoretical analysis elucidates that cell size and the cell's material in a structure cell of Steiner tree are the two main factors affecting the tearing properties, which are verified experimentally. The theoretical prediction of tearing strength will be greatly benefit for geometrical structure design for textile materials in the future."
"The main objective of this paper is to diagnose the influence of non-profit organisations in the development of wine tourism in Poland. Analysis is provided of their activities in promoting wine and wine tourism among farmers, people wanting to establish new vineyards, and tourists. Public sources are used as a secondary source for the research, including documents from the Agriculture Market Agency, the Central Statistical Office of Poland and non-profit organisations, as well as primary data. Interviews were used to research. These were conducted with the chairpersons of the following associations of wine growers: the Lesser Polish Gorge of the Vistula Wine Growers Association (Stowarzyszenie Maopolskiego Przeomu Wisy), the Polish Institute of Grapevines and Wine (Polski Instytut Winoroli i Wina), the Lesser Poland Wine Forum Association (Stowarzyszenie Maopolskie Forum Winne), and the Subcarpathian Wine Growers Association (Podkarpackie Stowarzyszenie Winiarzy). Research was conducted between April and June 2012. The results confirmed the importance of non-profit organisations in developing winery and wine tourism in Poland. These organisations motivate people to wine production through coaching, combined operations, and joint meetings. They organise events such as wine festivals and competitions; cooperate with the media; receive money from local governments for activities to enhance the attractiveness of the region and initiate common work to change wine legislation in Poland."
"In this paper, a novel regression method based on modified particle swarm optimization (MPSO) and least squares support vector machines (LSSVMs) is proposed to tackle the problem of nonlinear modeling of the flux linkage for bearingless permanent magnet synchronous motors (BPMSMs). The main objective of this method is to improve the accuracy of the flux linkage model based on the LSSVM technique by applying the MPSO to determine the optimal kernel parameter and regularization parameter of the LSSVM automatically. The rotor angle, torque winding current and suspension force winding current are employed as inputs, and the flux linkage is used as output of the LSSVM. The sampled data are obtained from the experimental prototype by the finite elements method. The relation between inputs and output is trained and the accuracy of the MPSO-LSSVM model of flux linkage was gained. The simulation experiment results indicate that good robustness and predicting precision of MPSO-LSSVM model was obtained. In particular, the MPSO-LSSVM model was compared with the PSO-LSSVM model, and the comparison results show that the MPSO-LSSVM model can get the superior performance in high precision and quick convergence."
"Fibrinolysis is recommended in European and US guidelines for patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) when a strategy of primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PPCI) is associated with >= 120 min delay from first medical contact (FMC), defined as call to the emergency medical services or self-presentation at hospital. Current evidence indicates that reperfusion therapy should be initiated as soon as possible after FMC. However, fibrinolysis cannot be initiated instantaneously at FMC, and PPCI is superior to fibrinolysis in reducing mortality if the extra time needed to perform PPCI instead of fibrinolysis (so-called PCI-related delay) is <120 min. During the past 10 years, the terms 'FMC-to-PPCI delay' and 'PCI-related delay' have been used in guidelines synonymously; however, a distinction should be made between the recommended FMC-to-PPCI delay and the acceptable PCI-related delay. In the future, an ideal recommendation would be to initiate reperfusion as soon as possible, preferably within 120 min of FMC in the case of PPCI. When the expected PCI-related delay is <120 min, PPCI should be the preferred reperfusion strategy, even if the FMC-to-PPCI delay is >120 min. Setting up a health-care system enabling prehospital diagnosis of STEMI with field triage of patients directly to catheterization laboratories at large-volume PCI centres (bypassing local hospitals, coronary care units, emergency departments, and intensive care units) will help to increase the proportion of patients with STEMI who will benefit from PPCI.

"Over the past few decades, major advances in the field of molecular biology, coupled with advances in genomic technologies, have led to an explosive growth in the biological data generated by the scientific community. The critical need to process and analyze such a deluge of data and turn it into useful knowledge has caused bioinformatics to gain prominence and importance. Bioinformatics is an interdisciplinary research area that applies techniques, methodologies, and tools in computer and information science to solve biological problems. In Nigeria, bioinformatics has recently played a vital role in the advancement of biological sciences. As a developing country, the importance of bioinformatics is rapidly gaining acceptance, and bioinformatics groups comprised of biologists, computer scientists, and computer engineers are being constituted at Nigerian universities and research institutes. In this article, we present an overview of bioinformatics education and research in Nigeria. We also discuss professional societies and academic and research institutions that play central roles in advancing the discipline in Nigeria. Finally, we propose strategies that can bolster bioinformatics education and support from policy makers in Nigeria, with potential positive implications for other developing countries."
"There is evidence of the relationship between mental illness and smoking and increased risk of depressive episodes after quitting smoking, even with specific treatments for abstinence. Objective: To assess the influence of a cessation program on the emotional state of patients by measuring levels of anxiety / depression and differences depending on the presence of psychiatric history. Method: A prospective observational study of patients taking part in a combined program (pharmacological and cognitive-behavioral) for giving up smoking. Anxiety (A) and depression (D) were measured using the HADS questionnaire at baseline, first and third month of abstinence. Results: Anxiety and depression showed significant and progressive improvement during treatment (A: baseline 9.2 +/- 4.5, 5.9 +/- 3.6 1 month, 3 months 4.5 +/- 3.1, p < 0 05 / D: baseline 5.5 +/- 4.1; 1 month 3 +/- 3; 3 months 2.3 +/- 2.1, p < 0.05), in psychiatry population (A: baseline 11.3 +/- 4, 5; 1 month 7.1 +/- 3.7, 5.3 +/- 3.5 3 months, p < 0.05 / D: baseline 7.4 +/- 4.8, 4.2 +/- 3.6 one month; 3 months 3 +/- 2.9, p < 0.05), regardless of treatment. Abstinence rate: 58.5%, unaffected by baseline levels of anxiety and depression. No significant neuropsychiatric side effects were detected. Conclusions: Anxiety and depression levels evolved favourably during the program, achieving good results regardless of the presence of psychiatric pathology."
"In this article, I explore how the discursive context shapes the outcome of protest actors' framing strategies in conflicts over large-scale land transformations. I use the discursive opportunity structures (DOS) concept to show that the outcome of framing strategies is influenced by national and transnational discursive structures. These differ depending on the specific purpose of land valorisation. Further factors influencing the outcomes are counter frames of the opponents, quality of framing strategies and frictions within movements. Empirically, I compare framing strategies used by protest actors in conflicts around a gold mine and an agro-industrial project in Senegal."
"A low bandgap copolymer poly(3,5-didecanyldi thieno[3,2-b:2',3'-d]thiophene-alt-9-fluorenone) (PDTTFO) consisting of dithieno[3,2-b:2',3'-d]thiophene (DTT) and 9-fluorenone (FO) was synthesized as the donor material for the polymer solar cells via Stille coupling polymerization. Both donor and acceptor units were confirmed by FT-IR and H-1-NMR. Optoelectronic properties of the PDTTFO copolymer were investigated and observed by UV-vis, photolumi nescence (PL) spectrum, and cyclic voltammogram (CV). UV-vis spectrum of the film exhibited two absorption peaks centered at 358, 474 nm with a broad absorption band in the range of 300-700 nm and showed a low bandgap of 1.68 eV. The highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy levels of the polymer were estimated to be -5.09 and -3.41 eV, respectively. Based on the ITO/PEDOT: PSS/PDTTFO: PCBM/Al device structure, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) under the illumination of AM 1.5 (100 mW/cm(2)) was 0.374 %. The effects of annealing temperature on the device performance were studied. At annealing temperature of 175 degrees C/30 min, the device demonstrated an optimal efficiency of 0.923 %. The improved device efficiency under the optimal condition was confirmed by the higher light harvest in UV-vis spectra, the enhanced quenching of photoluminescence (PL) emission, the improved nanoscale morphology by atomic force microscopy (AFM) examination, and the increase in external quantum efficiency."
"We introduce a class of generalized universal irrational rotation C*-algebras A(theta,gamma) = C*(x, w) which is characterized by the relations w* w = ww* = 1, x* x =gamma(w), xx* = gamma(e(-2 pi i theta)w), and xw = e(-2 pi i theta)wx, where theta is an irrational number and gamma(z) is an element of C(T) is a positive function. We characterize tracial linear functionals, simplicity, and K-groups of A(theta,gamma) in terms of zero points of gamma(z). We show that if A(theta,gamma) is simple then A(theta,gamma) is an AT-algebra of real rank zero. We classify A(theta,gamma) in terms of theta and zero points of gamma(z). Let A(theta) = C*(u, v) be the universal irrational rotation C*-algebra with vu = e(2 pi i theta)uv. Then C*(u + v) congruent to A(theta),vertical bar 1+z vertical bar(2). As an application, we show that C*(u + v) is a proper simple C*-subalgebra of A. which has a unique trace, K-1(C*(u + v)) congruent to Z, and there is an order isomorphism of K-0(C*(u+v)) onto Z+ Z theta. Moreover, C*(u+v) is a unital simple AT-algebra of real rank zero. We also show that u + v is strongly irreducible relative to the hyperfinite type II1 factor."
"The capacity of natural sorbents to remove direct dye from synthetic wastewater has been investigated. Two wood samples (Beech and Silver fir) were chosen to be tested for the removal of a direct red dye (DR). The effects of the support nature, dose, the specific surface of natural fibres, as well as the dye concentration, temperature and the pH influence on the adsorption process were investigated. The results indicate that the percentage of the removed dye rises with reducing the temperature and increasing the dose of the natural fibre, by reducing the apparent area of the sorbent. The kinetics of adsorption obeys a pseudo-second-order rate equation, and Sips isotherm models were found to fit the experimental results the best. The thermodynamic analysis shows that adsorption of DR on the investigated wood fibres was favourable and spontaneous."
"Water-soluble eight-armed poly(ethylene glycol)-poly(L-lactide) star block copolymers linked by an amide or ester group between the PEG core and the PLA blocks (PEG-(NHCO)-(PLA)(8) and PEG-(OCO)-(PLA)(8)) were synthesized by the stannous octoate catalyzed ring-opening polymerization of L-lactide using an amine- or hydroxyl-terminated eight-armed star PEG, At concentrations above the critical gel concentration, thermosensitive hydrogels were obtained, showing a reversible single gel-to-sol transition. At similar composition PEG-(NHCO)-(PLA)(8) hydrogels were formed at significantly lower polymer concentrations and had higher storage moduli. Whereas the hydrolytic degradation/dissolution of the PEG-(OCO)-(PLA)(8) takes place by preferential hydrolysis of the ester bond between the PEG and PLA block, the PEG-(NHCO)-(PLA)(8) hydrogels degrade through hydrolysis of ester bonds in the PLA main chain. Because of their relatively good mechanical properties and slow degradation in vitro, PEG-(NHCO)-(PLA)(8) hydrogels are interesting materials for biomedical applications such as controlled drug delivery systems and matrices for tissue engineering."
"We introduce a method to monitor dispensing ratios during labeling reactions in hydrogen exchange (HX)-MS. The method corrects for systematic and random dispensing errors and harmonizes data incorporating variable %D2O in the experiment design. A correction factor for deuterium levels is obtained by quantifying the relative signal intensities arising from nonexchanging heavy caffeine (spiked into labeling buffer) and light caffeine (spiked into sample solutions). Dispensing variability over a wide range of %D2O composition can be detected and corrected to a common value, and although random dispensing error is usually minor, we show it can be the limiting factor in high quality signal measurements. Applying a dispensing control is therefore an effective tool for monitoring measurement precision in HX-MS."
"A new water soluble rhodium(III) complex [Rh(eta(4)-L)Cl] (1a) has been isolated from the reaction between RhCl3 center dot 3H(2)O and salophen ligand [L = N,N'-bis(salicylidene)-1,2-phenylenediamine (a)] in 1:1 molar ratio in dichloromethane solution. The complex la has been characterized by FT-IR, UV-vis, ESI-MS, H-1 and C-13 NMR spectroscopy. Theoretical calculations (B3LYP) and spectroscopic evidence recommends that the ligand a coordinates to the Rh centre through imine N and phenolic O donor atoms. The complex 1a emerged out to be an effective catalyst for oxidation of alcohols in water. Excellent yields of carbonyl compounds have been acquired for a comprehensive assortment of substrates with H2O2 as oxidant at a relatively low loading of catalyst. Thus, the Rh(III)-H2O-H2O2 catalytic system could act as an environmentally benign alternative to oxidation methods in conventional organic solvents."
"The purpose of this paper is to propose a new index for the seismic damage estimation of service lines. The proposed index is based on the tension of each service line due to an earthquake event. Because the tension is evaluated using not only the seismic intensity, but also the dynamic properties of the major components of the distribution equipment, including poles, lines, transformers, and service lines, the proposed index makes it possible to quantitatively differentiate the seismic damage level of every distribution pole. Using the records of seismic damage caused by the 2007 Niigata-ken Chuetsu-oki earthquake, the estimation accuracy of the proposed index is compared to that of existing damage indices. It is shown that the proposed index is more suitable than existing indices for equipment damage estimation. (c) 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

"In this paper, a magnetic multi-walled carbon nanotube (MMWCNT) was developed and investigated to explore the possible application in the simultaneous removal of atrazine and Cu (II) from contaminated water. The Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) specific surface area, magnetization measurement, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Thermo-gravimetric Analysis (TGA) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analyses were used to characterize the adsorbent. Batch adsorption experiments were conducted to study the sorption performance of MMWCNT. The adsorption of atrazine and Cu (II) were both unfavorable under acidic conditions. The sorption kinetics data were well described by pseudo-second-order kinetic model. The sorption isotherms for atrazine and Cu (II) were better fitted by Freundlich model and Langmuir model, respectively. Cu (II) had a strong suppression effect on atrazine uptake in the simultaneous adsorption and atrazine preloading experiment. As for Cu (II) preloading, the impact of atrazine on Cu (II) desorption was almost negligible. The regeneration of MMWCNT for several cycles using acidic ethanol solution and practical application of MMWCNT were also investigated. Due to its high adsorption capacity, easy separation and effective reusability, MMWCNT showed great potential in wastewater treatment. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."
"An hourglass in-fiber air microcavity Fabry-Perot interferometer is proposed in this paper, and its second reflecting surface of in-fiber microcavity is designed to be a concave reflector with the best curvature radius in order to improve the spectral characteristics. Experimental results proved that the extinction ratio of Fabry-Perot interferometer with cavity length of 60 mu m and concave reflector radius of 60 mu mis higher than for a rectangular Fabry-Perot interferometer with cavity length of 60 mu m (14 dB: 11 dB). Theory and numerical simulation results show that the strain sensitivity of sensor can be improved by reducing the microcavity wall thickness and microcavity diameter, and when the in-fiber microcavity length is 40 mu m, the microcavity wall thickness is 10 mu m, the microcavity diameter is 20 mu m, and the curvature radius of reflective surface II is 50 mu m, the interference fringe contrast of is greater than 0.97, an Axial-pull sensitivity of 20.46 nm/N and resolution of 1 mN can be achieved in the range of 0-1 N axial tension. The results show that the performance of hourglass in-fiber microcavity interferometer is far superior to that of the traditional Fabry-Perot interferometer."
"Advances in hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) and immunosuppressive therapy (IST) have improved survival in severe aplastic anemia (SAA) from 10%-20% in the 1960s to 80%-90% today. A matched sibling HSCT is the treatment of choice in younger patients, whereas IST is often used in older patients or in those who lack a histocompatible sibling. Graft rejection, GVHD, and poor immune reconstitution (with associated infectious complications) limit the success of HSCT, whereas lack of response, relapse, and clonal evolution limit the success of IST. The historically high rate of graft rejection in SAA is now less problematic in the matched setting, but with greater rates observed with unrelated and umbilical cord donors. The correlation of increasing age with the risk of GVHD and the significant morbidity and mortality of this transplantation complication continue to affect the decision to pursue HSCT versus IST as initial therapy in adults with SAA. Outcomes with matched unrelated donor HSCT have improved, likely due to better donor selection, supportive care, and improved transplantation protocols. Results with mismatched unrelated donor and umbilical HSCT are not as favorable, with higher rates of graft rejection, GVHD, and infectious complications. Investigation of several upfront alternative IST protocols has not improved outcomes beyond horse antithymocyte globulin and cyclosporine. More recently, the role of alemtuzumab in SAA has been better defined and an oral thrombomimetic, eltrombopag, is showing promising activity in refractory cases. The most recent advances in HSCT and IST in SAA are discussed in this review."
"This paper is concerned with palladium-(La0.75Sr0.25)(0.97)Cr0.5Mn0.5O3 (LSCM) composite current collectors for solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs); the composites, which are in a 2D configuration (thickness of about 8-10 mu m) are deposited upon an LSCM electrode layer on top of an yttria zirconia electrolyte substrate. The influence of the LSCM particle size on the adhesion between palladium and LSCM are reported and discussed. Compositions using four different LSCM particle sizes (0.21, 0.49, 0.64, and 0.81 mu m) with sintered Pd particle sizes approaching 10 mu m are investigated. The best bonding is obtained when smaller particles are used. The electrical dc conductivity of the composite is reported as a function of the palladium volume fraction for all used LSCM particle sizes. The measured experimental values present typical insulating-conductive percolation. However, the transition occurs at similar to 33% of the conductive phase, that is, a lower percentage than for 2D ideal systems and a higher percentage than for 3D ideal systems. This is consistent with lower-dimension percolation for a system of large-grained conductors and small-grained insulators. The general effective media (GEM) equation is used to fit the experimental data, and the two main parameters (the threshold point phi(c) and the exponent t) are defined."
"Axially compressed bilaterally constrained columns, which can attain multiple snap-through buckling events in their elastic postbuckling response, can be used as energy concentrators and mechanical triggers to transform external quasi-static displacement input to local high-rate motions and excite vibration-based piezoelectric transducers for energy harvesting devices. However, the buckling location with highest kinetic energy release along the element, and where piezoelectric oscillators should be optimally placed, cannot be controlled or isolated due to the changing buckling configurations. This paper proposes the concept of stiffness variations along the column to gain control of the buckling location for optimal placement of piezoelectric transducers. Prototyped non-prismatic columns with piece-wise varying thickness were fabricated through 3D printing for experimental characterization and numerical simulations were conducted using the finite element method. A simple theoretical model was also developed based on the stationary potential energy principle for predicting the critical line contact segment that triggers snap-through events and the buckling morphologies as compression proceeds. Results confirm that non-prismatic column designs allow control of the buckling location in the elastic postbuckling regime. Compared to prismatic columns, non-prismatic designs can attain a concentrated kinetic energy release spot and a higher number of snap-buckling mode transitions under the same global strain. The direct relation between the column's dynamic response and the output voltage from piezoelectric oscillator transducers allows the tailorable postbuckling response of non-prismatic columns to be used as multi-stable energy concentrators with enhanced performance in micro-energy harvesters."
"Aim: To determine the frequency of dysmenorrhea and its associated symptoms amongst a number of adolescent female students and to investigate the possible association between daily dairy product intake and dysmenorrhea. Methods: A self-assessment questionnaire was completed by 127 female university students aged between 19 and 24 years. Participants gave information that included demographics, the nature, type, and severity of pain associated with menstruation if any, management used to relieve dysmenorrhea, associated symptoms, and a general assessment of dietary intake of dairy products. Results: The prevalence of primary dysmenorrhea in the population studied was 87.4% with the majority of the participants' pain symptoms beginning a few days before and continuing through the first two days of menstruation. Forty-six percent of students were found to have severe dysmenorrhea. Abdominal bloating was the most frequently expressed symptom associated with dysmenorrhea amongst the population studied. Dysmenorrhea and associated symptoms were found in significantly fewer female students who consumed three or four servings of dairy products per day as compared to participants who consumed no dairy products. Conclusion: Primary dysmenorrhea is common in young women. This study helps us to better understand the relationship between low dietary intake of dairy products and the risk of dysmenorrhea."
"This study was carried out to evaluate the effect of probiotic (Bacillus latrospores and Bacillus licheniformis) on growth and survival of Silver carp larvae (Hypophthalmichthys molitrix). Rotifers (Brachionus plicatilis) were used as live prey vehicle for probiotic transport. They were cultured in sea water with 15 ppt salinity and Nannochloropsis oculata microalgae was used as feed. Five treatments were prepared with three replicates (four experimental treatments and one control). Silver carp larvae were obtained from a local fish farm (Golestan, Iran). Rotifers were filtered from intensive cultivation tanks with 200 rotifer/ml density and then transferred to conical glasses for the enrichment process, and were kept under enrichment conditions for 24 h. Two forms of enrichment were carried out: rotifer biocapsulation and rearing water enrichment. T-1 and T-2 were fed with biocapsulated rotifers and T-3 and T-4 were fed non-biocapsulated rotifers. Instead of biocapsulation, the same density of bacteria was injected directly into the rearing water of T-3 and T-4. T-3 (4.4 +/- 1.2 mg) and T-4 (5.05 +/- 1.95 mg) treatments of probiotic injected water had significantly higher growth rates than T-1 (2.21 +/- 0.94 mg) and T-2 (3.9 +/- 0.36 mg), (P<0.05). T-1 (3.9 +/- 1.03 mg) and T-2 (3.3 +/- 0.36 mg) had higher growth rates than the control (2.21 +/- 0.94 mg) and were also significantly different from each other (P<0.05)."
"This study examined how employees perceive intended strategic goals and HRM at the ward level, and if these perceptions generate the desired effects. The qualitative part of the research reveals that the hospital pursues two strategic goals (i.e. quality and safety). Analysis of the questionnaire data (N = 576 respondents; 59 wards) shows that both climate dimensions could be distinguished. Results showed that the perceived HR system does have a significant influence on both climate dimensions, suggesting that the overall message of the HR system is important for creating strategic climates. Furthermore, the climate for quality partially mediated the relationship between the perceived HR system and commitment."
A study of the activation of the light-induced degradation in compensated n-type Czochralski grown silicon is presented. A kinetic model is established that verifies the existence of both the fast and the slow components known from p-type and proves the quadratic dependence of the defect generation rates of both defects on the hole concentration. The model allows for the description of lifetime degradation kinetics in compensated n-type silicon under various intensities and is in accordance with the findings for p-type silicon. We found that the final concentrations of the slow defect component in compensated n-type silicon only depend on the interstitial oxygen concentration and on neither the boron concentration nor the equilibrium electron concentration n(0). The final concentrations of the fast defect component slightly increase with increasing boron concentration. The results on n-type silicon give new insight to the origin of the BO defect and question the existing models for the defect composition. (C) 2015 AIP Publishing LLC.
"The recent Ebola virus disease (EVD) epidemic in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone demonstrated that the World Health Organization (WHO) is incapable to control outbreaks of infectious diseases in less developed regions of the world.

"Maize flour was infested with fresh emerged Tribolium castaneum adults, and its nutritional composition was evaluated after 0, 45, and 90 days of the infestation. Furthermore, 99% carbon dioxide was applied to different developmental stages of T. castaneum for its management. There were six treatments and five replicates; for each replicate, maize flour (150 g) was taken in a 250-ml plastic jar container, insects were released in the flour, and jars were placed into the incubator at a temperature of 28 +/- 1 degrees C, 60 +/- 5% RH. Similarly, the application of 99% CO2 was done with four exposure times of 12.24, 48, and 72 h, at 35 degrees C 65 +/- 5% RH. Present results showed major fluctuations in the nutritive composition of maize flour. Increase in the moisture, fat, fiber, protein, and ash contents was directly proportional to the increase in infestation level and time, contrary to the depletion of carbohydrates and total weight loss. The results of CO2 treatment indicated that pupa was the most resilient stage as compared with larvae and adult stage. The observed susceptibility order was as follows: adult > larvae > pupae. The maximum mortality of adult, larval, and pupal stages was recorded after 24, 48, and 72 h of CO2 application, respectively. These findings might be helpful to develop an ecofriendly technique to manage this crucial pest."
"In this study the integral form of the radiative transfer equation in a two-layer inhomogeneous slab for linearly anisotropic scattering has been solved using the Galerkin-iterative technique. The medium is considered to have internal space dependent energy source, diffusely and specularly reflecting boundaries, interface transmission and diffuse surface source. The reflection, the transmission coefficients, incident energy and the net radiative heat flux through the medium has been calculated for different media. The calculation was carried out for inhomogeneous media of transparent, diffusely and specularly reflecting boundaries with isotropic, forward and backward linear anisotropic scattering. Results obtained for isotropic scattering in homogeneous and inhomogeneous media of source free problem are compared with the previous work and an excellent agreement has been achieved.

"Baseline characterization of concentrations and isotopic values of dissolved natural gases is needed to identify contamination caused by the leakage of fugitive gases from oil and gas activities. Methods to collect and analyze baseline concentration-depth profiles of dissolved CH4 and C2H6 and delta C-13-CH4 in shales and Quaternary clayey tills were assessed at two sites in the Williston Basin, Canada. Core and cuttings samples were stored in Isojars (R) in a low O-2 headspace prior to analysis. Measurements and multiphase diffusion modeling show that the gas concentrations in core samples yield well-defined and reproducible depth profiles after 31-d equilibration. No measurable oxidative loss or production during core sample storage was observed. Concentrations from cuttings and mud gas logging (including IsoTubes (R)) were much lower than from cores, but correlated well. Simulations suggest the lower concentrations from cuttings can be attributed to drilling time, and therefore their use to define gas concentration profiles may have inherent limitations. Calculations based on mud gas logging show the method can provide estimates of core concentrations if operational parameters for the mud gas capture cylinder are quantified. The delta C-13-CH4 measured from mud gas, IsoTubes (R), cuttings, and core samples are consistent, exhibiting slight variations that should not alter the implications of the results in identifying the sources of the gases. This study shows core and mud gas techniques and, to a lesser extent, cuttings, can generate high-resolution depth profiles of dissolved hydrocarbon gas concentrations and their isotopes."
"This paper studies well-known tests by Kim et al. (J Econom 109:389-392, 2002) and Busetti and Taylor (J Econom 123:33-66, 2004) for the null hypothesis of short memory against a change to nonstationarity, I (1). The potential break point is not assumed to be known but estimated from the data. First, we show that the tests are also applicable for a change from I (0) to a fractional order of integration I (d) with d > 0 (long memory) in that the tests are consistent. The rates of divergence of the test statistics are derived as functions of the sample size T and d. Second, we compare their finite sample power experimentally. Third, we consider break point estimation for a change from I (0) to I (d) for finite samples in computer simulations. It turns out that the estimators proposed for the integer case (d = 1) are practically reliable only if d is close enough to 1."
"In this paper, a new experimental approach is proposed to enhance the performances of the conventional solar still using the natural circulation effect inside the still. The idea consists in generating air flow by a rectangular natural circulation loop appended to the rear side of the still. The proposed still was tested during summer period and the experimental data presented in this paper concerns four typical days. The convective heat transfer coefficient is evaluated and compared with Dunkle's model. The comparison shows that convective heat transfer is considerably improved by the air convection created inside the still. The natural circulation phenomenon in the still is studied and a good agreement between the experimental data and Vijajan's laminar correlation is found. Therefore, natural circulation phenomenon is found to have a good effect on the still performances where the still daily productivity is of 3.72 kg/m(2) and the maximum efficiency is of 45.15%.

"In this paper, we first prove that the solution map of the Cauchy problem for a coupled Camassa-Holm system is not uniformly continuous in H-s(T) x H-s(T), s > 3/2, the proof of which is based on well posedness estimates and the method of approximate solutions. Then we study the continuity properties of its solution map further and show that it is Holder continuous in the H-sigma(T) x H-sigma(T) topology with 1/2 < sigma < s. Our results can also be carried out on the nonperiodic case."
"Traditional risk factors do not adequately identify individuals at risk for CKD. We related a multi-marker panel consisting of the following seven circulating biomarkers to the incidence of CKD and microalbuminuria (MA) in 2345 participants who attended the sixth Framingham Offspring Study examination (1995 to 1998): C-reactive protein, aldosterone, renin, B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP), plasminogen-activator inhibitor type 1, fibrinogen, and homocysteine. We defined CKD at follow-up (2005 to 2008) as estimated GFR (eGFR) <60 ml/min per 1.73 m(2); we defined MA as urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio >= 25 (women) or 17 (men) mg/g on spot urine samples. We identified a parsimonious set of markers related to outcomes adjusting for standard risk factors and baseline renal function, and we assessed their incremental predictive utility. During a mean 9.5-year follow-up, 213 participants developed CKD and 186 developed MA. In multivariable logistic regression models, the multi-marker panel was associated with incident CKD (P < 0.001) and MA (P = 0.003). Serum homocysteine and aldosterone both were significantly associated with CKD incidence, and log-transformed aldosterone, BNP, and homocysteine were significantly associated with incident MA. Biomarkers improved risk prediction as measured by improvements in the c-statistics for both CKD and MA and by a 7% increase in net risk reclassification. In conclusion, circulating homocysteine, aldosterone, and BNP provide incremental information regarding risk for incident CKD and MA beyond traditional risk factors."
"Introduction: transition is important for a successful follow-up of adolescents with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).The objectives of the study were to establish the situation of transition in Spain and to identify needs, requirements and barriers to transition from pediatric and adult gastroenterologist perspectives. Methods: a structured survey for self-completion using the REDCap platform was distributed via the Spanish Society for Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition (SEGHNP) and the Spanish Working Group on Crohn's Disease and Ulcerative Colitis (GETECCU). The questionnaire contained closed and ranked questions concerning transition, perceived needs, organizational, clinician and patient related barriers to transition. Results: one hundred and forty surveys were answered, 53% in pediatrics (PG) and 47% from adult gastroenterologists (AG) among 90 hospitals; 66% of them were reference centers. There was a higher response from pediatricians (18.2%) versus adult gastroenterologists (8.3%) (p = 0.03). A structured transition program is adequate in 42.2% centers. A well-structured transition was perceived as very important by 79.5% of PG and 63% of AG (p = 0.03). A higher proportion of both groups identified inadequacies in the preparation of adolescents for transfer (43% and 38%, p = ns).The main deficit areas were the lack of knowledge about disease and treatment as well as the lack of self-advocacy and care coordination. Lack of resources, time and critical mass of patients were the highest ranked barriers by both groups. AG and PG (54% and 55%) highlighted suboptimal training in adolescent medicine. Conclusions: in Spain, nearly half of the centers have developed a structured transition program. Lack of training, time and insufficient resources are the main barriers for a successful transition."
"Researchers conducted a closed-course study to evaluate the impact of work zone lighting on the ability of drivers to detect low-contrast objects and workers wearing high-visibility vests. Three lighting conditions were set up: no lights (dark or base condition); a portable, trailer-mounted light tower; and a portable balloon light. The dark scenario treatments confirmed that a worker wearing a retroreflective vest could be detected at significantly longer distances than a low-contrast object (a box, a target, and a tire). Researchers also confirmed that drivers tended to overdrive their headlights, especially in rural, dark scenarios. Compared with the results for the dark scenarios, the results for the illuminated roadway section showed that properly installed temporary work zone lighting could increase the distance at which workers and low-contrast objects could be detected. The results also confirmed that improper positioning of portable light towers had a negative impact on the distance at which workers and low-contrast objects could be detected and supported the theory that direct illumination by portable light towers could visually wash out workers and thus could make them more difficult to detect."
"In this work, yttrium iron garnet films were prepared on a Ga3Gd5O12 substrate by pulsed laser deposition. The dependence of target grain size on the morphology, crystallinity, and magnetism of films was investigated. Firstly, X-ray diffraction revealed that the fine grain size of the target was beneficial for increasing the crystallinity of films. Secondly, scanning electron microscopy and roughness measurements displayed the film prepared by the small grain size of the target has better morphology and lower roughness. Lastly, magnetic hysteresis loops and ferromagnetic resonance measurements further shown that a good microstructure and fine grain size of target facilitated the growth of film with greater magnetic properties. Consequently, YIG film deposited by 1.0 mu m-target has magnetic properties with a high saturation magnetization of 155 emu/cm(3), a low saturation magnetic field of 1077 Oe, and low ferromagnetic resonance linewidth of 42 Oe."
"We calculate pionic contribution to the relativistic Fermi liquid parameters (RFLPs) using a chiral effective Lagrangian. The RFLPs so determined are then used to calculate chemical potential, exchange and nuclear symmetry energies due to pi N interaction. We also evaluate two loop ring diagrams involving sigma, omega, and pi meson exchanges and compare results with what one obtains from the relativistic Fermi liquid theory (RFLT)."
"Despite the great importance placed upon the operation of abduction as an inferential process, few studies have been devoted specifically to the process of guessing as a piece of the abduction puzzle. This is surprising since Charles Peirce indicated that guessing is a fundamental part of the abductive process. Most literature concerning Peirce's conception of abduction mentions guessing only in passing; what guessing actually is, especially with regard to the abductive process, is left vague at best, and this leaves a blind spot in the literature so that the broader conception of abduction remains unclear. In response to this, I explain the role of guessing in Peirce's concept of abduction, placing the operation of guessing within the wider scope of the process of inquiry. I consider the guessing process as a deliberate and creative part of abduction, as well as alternative claims that have led to neglect of guessing as a creative operation. This analysis includes consideration of ethical, esthetic, and economic aspects of the guessing process as described by Peirce. As a specific example to elucidate how guessing functions within a particular scientific domain, I utilize the index case of AIDS. My argument sets the stage for further work to be done concerning the function of guessing as it pertains to scientific inquiry more generally."
"This paper investigates the problem of robust reliable control for the spacecraft rendezvous with limited-thrust. Based on the Clohessy-Wiltshire (C-W) equations and by considering the uncertainties and the possible failures, the dynamic model for spacecraft rendezvous is proposed, and the orbital transfer control problem is transformed into a stabilization problem. Then, by a Lyapunov approach, the existence conditions for admissible controllers are formulated in the form of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs), and the controller design is cast into a convex feasibility problem subject to LMI constraints. With the obtained controllers, the rendezvous can be accomplished with the limited-thrust in spite of the possible thruster failures. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is illustrated by simulation examples. (C) 2011 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved."
"Mutations in transmembrane protein 230 (TMEM230) have recently been reported to be associated with Parkinson's disease (PD) in a North American population. A highly prevalent mutation, c.550_552delTAGinsCCCGGG (p.*184ProGlyext*5) was found in 3.1% of Chinese familial PD patients. However, subsequent studies failed to replicate these findings in different populations. Our objective was to confirm the role of this gene in a large number of PD patients and controls in a Taiwanese population. Among 1,672 participants, we sequenced all coding exons and exon-intron boundary junctions of the TMEM230 gene in 180 probands with familial PD. We also genotyped the potential pathogenic variants identified and the previously reported mutations (p.Arg141Leu, p.Tyr92Cys, p.*184Trpext*5, and p.*184ProGlyext*5) in an additional cohort of 500 patients with sporadic PD, and 992 age and gender-matched neurologically normal control subjects. We did not find any of the previously reported mutations, but we observed one novel missense exonic variant, c.G68A (p.Arg23Gln), in one patient with familial PD, and two patients with sporadic PD in a heterozygous state. However, subsequent analysis of this variant in 992 controls did not find any significant associations between p.Arg23Gln and the risk of PD (0.44% vs. 0.30%, p = 0.22). Our findings suggest that genetic variants of TMEM230 do not play a major role in PD in our Taiwanese population. Further experimental studies are warranted to confirm the pathogenicity of this gene in PD disease process."
"We use 2D UV-MS cold-ion spectroscopy for the identification of L-Asp, D-Asp, L-isoAsp and D-isoAsp residues in a fragment peptide derived from the hormone protein amylin. Relative solution concentrations of all four isoforms in an equimolar quaternary mixture have been determined within 4% error. This method demonstrates that for binary mixtures of the peptides an accuracy of 2.5% can be reached in few-second measurements."
"High levels of fluoride in groundwater cause a major problem for drinking water quality in many countries around the world. In addition to reverse osmosis (RO), recent publications indicate that nanofiltration (NF) is a promising technology to deal with fluoride removal from aqueous solutions. First of all, a characterization of commercial NF and RO membranes was performed in terms of hydraulic permeability (L-p and L'(p)) and contact angle (theta). Then, performances of the selected membranes on Cl-, NO3-, HCO3-, SO42- as well as F-rejection were determined within a laboratory study in simple salt. At 10 mg/L of concentration, pH = 6.7 and 10 bar, the rejections of fluoride with NF270, NF90 and BW30 were 63%, 91% and 97%, respectively. The influence of sulfate, chloride, nitrate and bicarbonate on fluoride rejection was also studied in binary mixtures with different concentration ratios (1/1, 1/2 and 2/1). Unlike the divalent anions, the results have shown that higher concentrations of monovalent anions affect positively fluoride rejection. Experimental data of fluoride rejection were modeled by using Spiegler-Kedem-Katchalsky model, first to confirm the experiment by calculating the non-linear parameter (chi(2)), and second to evaluate transfer mechanisms (convection and diffusion) of fluoride ions by estimating the phenomenological parameters of mass transfer (s and Ps) for the selected NF and RO membranes in simple and binary mixture. For NF membranes, a duality between both transfer mechanisms was recorded which was strongly affected by the feed composition."
"Electromagnetic (EM) wave pollution has become the chief physical pollution for environment. In recent years, some researches have been focused on the preparation of nano-composite absorbers at low temperatures or even at room temperature. In this letter, preparation of nano-composite by using high-energy ball milling at room temperature is reported. The core-nanoshell composite absorbers with magnetic fly-ash hollow cenosphere (MFHC) as nuclear and nanocrystalline magnetic material as shell were prepared by high-energy ball milling and vacuum-sintering in this paper. The pre-treatment of MFHC, the sintering process and the mol ratio of starting chemicals had a significant impact for property of composite absorbers. The results of X-ray diffraction analysis (XRD), transmission electron microscope (TEM), vibrating sample magnetometer (VSM) and vector network analyzer (VNA) analysis indicated that perfect-crystalline nanomagnetic material coating was gotten with a particle size of 12 nm after ball milling. The results show the MFHC is dielectric loss and magnetic loss too; the exchange-coupling interaction happened between ferrite of the MFHC and nanocrystalline magnetic material coating. The exchange-coupling interaction enhances magnetic loss of composite absorbers. They have a perfect EM parameters at low microwave frequency. The core-nanoshell composite absorbers have a higher magnetic loss at low frequencies, and it is consistent with requirements of the microwave absorbing material at the low-frequency absorption. The microwave absorptivity of the core-nanoshell composite absorbers is better than single material."
"A biofilter inoculated with a genetically engineered Escherichia coli strain was successfully applied to treat air streams containing a mixture of parathion and methyl parathion (MP). Average removal efficiencies of 95.2% for parathion and 98.6% for MP were obtained during the overall operation period. Compared with conventional biofilters, the biofilter inoculated with the engineered E. coli BL21 was far more effective, especially in the initial stages. Parathion and MP could be treated simultaneously within one biofilter. Metabolite analysis revealed that parathion and MP were hydrolysed to p-Nitrophenol (PNP). Additionally, nitrate and sulphate were detected during the biofilter operation. The biofilter performance and microbial community were also assessed and characterised."
"A number of factors influence gastrointestinal tissue structure and mechanical properties such as the physical environment and diseases like partial obstruction. Hence multi-axial biomechanical properties are important for understanding the pathophysiology of the obstructed intestine. The aim was to estimate the multi-axial biomechanical properties, in particular with focus on the shear modulus. Partial obstruction of mid-jejunum was created surgically by placement of a polyethylene ring for two weeks in seven male rats. Sham operation was made in five other rats. At the time for termination, three 6-cm intestinal segments were used for histological and mechanical analysis. The segments were obtained distal (S1), proximal (S2) and further proximal (S3) to the site of obstruction or suturing site. The tri-axial testing included simultaneous torsion, inflation and longitudinal stretching. The lumen size, wall thickness, wall cross-sectional area, and muscle layer thickness increased in S2 and S3 of the obstructed rats (p < 0.001) with the most pronounced changes in S2. The opening angle decreased in S2 in the obstructed group (p < 0.05). The tissue stiffness increased in circumferential and longitudinal direction where as it was softer in shear direction, especially in S2 (p < 0.01). In conclusion, the histomorphological and mechanical properties including shear properties remodeled proximal to the intestinal obstruction site."
"The food web of two intertidal seagrass (Zostera marina and Zostera noltii) beds that may be influenced by the seasonal variation in food source abundance was studied in winter and in summer with delta C-13 and delta N-13 analysis. In spite of high relative variation of abundance of main primary producers at the two sites, the food web did not vary between winter and summer. The delta C-13 range of primary producers was wide. Zostera leaves, the most C-13-enriched source, were not consumed directly by grazers. Deposit and filter feeders have a similar delta C-13 and could use a mix of suspended and sedimented organic particulate matter, largely composed of detritus from macroalgae to seagrass. This trophic pathway allows the local incorporation of the high biomass produced by seagrasses. The wide delta N-15 range of predators was linked either to a large variety from omnivore to carnivore predators or to the also wide ranges of delta N-15 of primary consumers."
"The neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn) is involved in IgG metabolism and transport in placental mammals. However, whether FcRn is responsible for IgG transfer from maternal serum to colostrum/milk is controversial. Interestingly, large domestic animals, such as cows, pigs, sheep, and horses, in which passive IgG transfer is exclusively completed via colostrum/milk, all express an FcRn a-chain that is shorter in the cytoplasmic tail (CYT) than its counterparts in humans and rodents. To address whether the length variation has any functional significance, we performed in vitro experiments using the Transwell system with the MDCK cell line stably transfected with various FcRn constructs; these clearly suggested that truncation of the CYT tail caused a polar change in IgG transfer. However, we observed no evidence supporting functional changes in IgG in vivo using mice in which the FcRn CYT was precisely truncated. These data suggest that the length variation in FcRn is not functionally associated with passive IgG transfer routes in mammals."
"A vertex set X of a graph G is an association set if each component of G - X is a clique, and a dissociation set if each of these cliques has only one or two vertices. We observe some special structures and show that if none of them exists, then the minimum association set problem can be reduced to the minimum weighted dissociation set problem. This yields the first nontrivial approximation algorithm for the association set problem, with approximation ratio 2.5. The reduction is based on a combinatorial study of modular decomposition of graphs free of these special structures. Further, a novel algorithmic use of modular decomposition enables us to implement our algorithm in O(mn + n(2)) time. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."
"Glass substrates modified by carbon/silica composites are fabricated through a two-step process for the preparation of a superhydrophobic surface (water contact angle a parts per thousand yen 150A degrees). Carbon nanoparticles were first prepared through a deposition process on glass using a hydrothermal synthesis route, then the glass was modified by SiO2 using the hydrolysis reaction of tetraethylorthosilicate at room temperature. It is not only a facile method to create a superhydrophobic surface, but also helps to form a multi-functional surface with high adhesive forces."
"Objective: To assess the association of Hemoglobin A1C (HbA1c) with acute brainstem infarctions (BSIs) and to determine whether HbA1c is an independent risk factor in BSIs patients. Methods: 96 only BSIs patients were categorized into four groups according to HbA1c as <6%, >= 6% but <7%, >= 7% but <8%, or >= 8%, respectively. The association of the four HbA1c groups with diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) infarct volumes (DIV), National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS), and follow-up modified Rankin Scale (FmRS) scores were analyzed. Patients also were categorized into two groups according to HbA1c<6% or >= 6%. Logistic regression analyses were performed to determine independent risk factors. Results: There was a significant correlation between HbA1c and DIV (Spearman rho=0339, P=0.001), NIHSS scores (rho= 0.292, P=0.004) and FmRS scores (rho=0315, P=0.002). The incidence of pons infarction was highest in BSIs and patients with HbA1c >= 6% showed significantly more frequent isolated pontine infarction. Logistic regression analyses showed that only HbA1c was independently associated with larger DIV (P=0.025) and FmRS scores (P=0.026). Conclusions: These results suggest that elevated HbA1c level may be a potential serologic marker in the evaluation of the severity and prognosis of acute BSIs. There is an urgent need to study control of diabetes mellitus (DM) before and after BSIs. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."
"For a Markov chain {X-j} with general state space S and f : S -> R-d, the large deviation principle for {n(-1) Sigma(n)(j=1) f(X-j)} is proved under a condition on the chain which is weaker than uniform recurrence but stronger than geometric recurrence and an integrability condition on f, for a broad class of initial distributions. This result is extended to the case when f takes values in a separable Banach space. Assuming only geometric ergodicity and under a non-degeneracy condition, a local large deviation result is proved for bounded f. A central analytical tool is the transform kernel, whose required properties, including new results, are established. The rate function in the large deviation results is expressed in terms of the convergence parameter of the transform kernel."
"Sierra de Gador is a complex, Triassic age aquifer system formed by dolostones and limestones with interbedded gypsum. On top, a thick Neogene-Quaternary series gives rise to shallow aquifers. F-Pb-Zn stratabound deposits are found within the Triassic carbonate formations. Their mineral paragenesis includes sphalerite, galena, pyrite, marcasite, fluorite and barite. The Sierra de Gador groundwater is the principal water resource for this semiarid environment, and the population is potentially exposed to hazardous elements related to mining activities and wastes. In October 1966, an intensive precipitation event (190mmday1) broke several old tailing structures, flooding part of the Berja village with polluted sludge. Fluorine values in some boreholes and springs were found higher than 1.5mgl1, the maximum value permitted by Spanish regulation for human consumption. Hydrogeochemistry data, statistical tools and geochemical simulations were used in this study to assess the physicochemical processes and the fluorine sources within this carbonate aquifer. Most of the analysed water samples are close to equilibrium with respect to carbonate minerals but are undersaturated with respect to fluorite and gypsum. About 39% of the samples have fluorine concentration higher than the regulatory limit. A statistical analysis indicates that fluorine has a low correlation with other variables. Inverse and mixing models, performed with the code PHREEQC, differentiate the predominance of waterrock interaction processes within the carbonate aquifer and water mixing between the carbonate and shallow aquifers. The results indicate that some fluorite dissolution must occur in the carbonate Triassic aquifer, whereas the shallow aquifers leach fluorine from mining wastes. Both types of aquifers are interconnected, and their waters mix below the flooded area. There, the high fluorine values appear to have two sources: (i) the regional fluorine enrichment due to the mineralization; and (ii) the polluted 1966 flood that reached the deep carbonates via the shallow aquifer."
"The gas in plastics mould has great influence on performance, appearance and lifespan of the injection molded parts. Venting channel and its appendix system should be used for gas exhausting in general. However, the dependence on the venting system complicates the mould design. Furthermore in certain condition, it is difficult to integrate the venting system into the mould. Currently a kind of mold material which has gas permeability has been developed in abroad, but the applications of this mold material were restricted by its higher cost and smaller size. In this research, a porous material which was made by powder metallurgy was applied to plastic mould to replace the venting system. Permeability of the steel with different secondary processing was tested and compared with a special apparatus. The metallographic samples of the steel with different secondary processing were prepared and investigated. Finally an actual injection set was established to investigate the applications of permeable steel. The metallographies indicate that the micro-holes inside permeable steel were interconnected. Moulds made of permeable steel exhibit good permeability in the plastic-injection experiments and gas generated in the mould cavity was smoothly exhausted. The melted plastic did not penetrate into the mould or block in the micro-holes. After several times of plastic-injection experiments, the mould still retained good permeability. The strength of this permeable steel is between 200-250 MPa and suitable for industrial applications. The venting systems simplified by permeable steel in plastic-injection have simple structures, which can be applied into any place that requires gas exhausting."
"Intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) is an important risk factor for perinatal complications and adult disease. IUGR is associated with down-regulation of placental amino acid transporter expression and activity at birth. It is unknown whether these changes are a cause or a consequence of human IUGR. We hypothesized that placental amino acid transport capacity is reduced prior to onset of reduced fetal growth in baboons with maternal nutrient restriction (MNR). Pregnant baboons were fed either a control (n = 8) or MNR diet (70% of control diet, n = 9) from Gestational Day 30. At Gestational Day 120 (0.65 of gestation), fetuses and placentas were collected. Microvillous (MVM) and basal (BM) plasma membrane vesicles were isolated. System A and system L transport activity was determined in MVM, and leucine transporter activity was assessed in BM using radiolabeled substrates. MVM amino acid transporter isoform expression (SNAT1, SNAT2, and SNAT4 and LAT1 and LAT2) was measured using Western blots. LAT1 and LAT2 expression were also determined in BM. Maternal and fetal plasma amino acids concentrations were determined using mass spectrometry. Fetal and placental weights were unaffected by MNR. MVM system A activity was decreased by 37% in MNR baboon placentas (P = 0.03); however MVM system A amino acid transporter protein expression was unchanged. MVM system L activity and BM leucine transporter activity were not altered by MNR. Fetal plasma concentrations of essential amino acids isoleucine and leucine were reduced, while citrulline increased (P < 0.05) in MNR fetuses compared to controls. In this primate model of IUGR, placental MVM system A amino acid transporter activity is decreased prior to the onset of reduction in the fetal growth trajectory. The reduction in plasma leucine and isoleucine in MNR fetuses may be caused by reduced activity of MVM system A, which is strongly coupled with system L essential amino acid uptake. Our findings indicate that reduced placental amino acid transport may be a cause rather than a consequence of IUGR due to inadequate maternal nutrition."
"Manipulation of internal features, e.g., layer/twin interfaces, is standard practice in engineering structural materials to tailor their properties. In the present work, we fabricated nanotwinned (NT)-and nanocrystalline (NC)-Cu/X (X=Cr, Zr) nanolayered micropillars (NLs) with equal layer thickness (h) spanning from 5 to 125 nm. The microcompression methodology was employed to investigate the layer/ twin interfaces effects on plastic characteristics of nanolayered materials at different strain rates. Experimental results clearly unveil that the Cu/X NTNLs exhibit a significant increase in strength and in strain rate sensitivity (SRS) by introducing nanotwins, in comparison with the Cu/X NCNLs. The non-monotonic evolution of SRS with h observed in the Cu/X NTNLs is explained by a competition between the monotonically increased interfaces density and the decreased twin boundaries density with reduction in feature size h. Unlike the monotonically enhanced SRS of Cu/X NCNLs, the SRS of Cu/X NTNLs first decreases and subsequently increases with reducing h. A phenomenological model is proposed to rationalize these experimental findings and highlight the microstructural feature size effects on the rate-limiting processes of metallic materials.

"It is increasingly evident that conditional gene expression in pigs is necessary to make transgenic models. In this study, we investigated conditional expression in porcine fetal fibroblasts using Cre-loxP recombination, a system that has had limited application in large animals to date. Transformed fibroblasts were reprogrammed in enucleated oocytes to support further early embryonic development. Fetal fibroblasts from miniature pigs were used for transfection with a plasmid that contained a red fluorescent protein marker (pCALNL-DsRed) and a floxed neomycin-resistance gene. Cells were selected with 750 mu g/ml neomycin for 2 weeks following transfection but did not express DsRed after visualization under a fluorescence microscope. Expression was achieved only after transient transfection with plasmid DNA that expressed the Cre recombinase enzyme. The cells that expressed DsRed were used for somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT). A total of 121 oocytes were used for SCNT and 76 cloned embryos (62.8%) were seen to have cleaved. Six blastocysts developed after SCNT and expressed DsRed. Deletion of the floxed neomycin-resistance gene was confirmed by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) in cloned blastocysts. This study demonstrated that Cre-loxP recombination can be conducted successfully in miniature pig fibroblasts and that the sequentially transformed cells can develop to the pre-implantation embryo stage via SCNT."
"Calixdrugs are calix[4]arene-based clusters (chaliced shapes) of established therapeutic drugs (e.g., penicillin, cephalosporin, tyrosol, and carboplatin) that are innovatively named calixpenam, calixcephem, calixtyrosol, and calixplatin, respectively. Going over the structures of cluster compounds, the calixarene scaffold lies at the heart of the structure (chaliced shape of drug), and it is an integral part of the cluster. In fact, the monomer drugs contribute as 1/4 of the corresponding cluster. In addition, probably because of the multivalency, spatial preorganization, and synergistic effect of four impacted drug units in the structures of calixdrugs, they are more effective in interactions with the target sites over their corresponding monomers."
"We describe here the synthesis and antimicrobial activity of silver-clay nanohybrid structure that was processed to exhibit a combination of accelerated and diffusion-controlled antimicrobial activity, with long term impact. The antimicrobial activity is assessed in terms of interaction with Escherichia coli, where the constituents of the nanohybrid structure play a synergistic role. Clay provides a physically stable surface for nucleation of silver nanoparticles. Additionally, the parallel- stacked layered structure of clay facilitates diffusion-controlled antimicrobial activity of in-situ precipitated silver. The antimicrobial activity is about four orders of magnitude greater than ex-situ precipitated bare silver particles. The study emphasizes the significance of controlling antimicrobial activity in nanostructured systems, which in the present case is enhanced and controlled antimicrobial activity with long term implication.

"Peroxynitrite is a powerful and long-lived oxidant generated in vivo. Peroxynitrous acid (ONOOH), its protonated form, may penetrate into phospholipid bilayers and undergo homolytic cleavage to nitrogen dioxide (center dot NO2) and hydroxyl radicals (center dot OH), causing severe nitro-oxidative damage. The membrane environment is thought to influence ONOOH reactions, but the mechanisms remain speculative. Most experimental techniques lack the level of resolution required to keep track of the motion of very reactive species and their interactions with the membrane. Here, we performed molecular dynamics simulations of the permeation, interactions, and dynamics of ONOOH and its homolysis products in the phospholipid membrane environment. We started by developing an ONOOH model that successfully accounted for its conformational equilibria and solvation energies. Membrane permeation of ONOOH was accompanied by conformational changes. ONOOH exhibited a strong tendency to bind to and accumulate at the membrane headgroup region. There, ONOOH homolysis led to center dot NO2 radicals, which in turn partitioned to the membrane interior. About one-third of the center dot OH radicals readily escaped to the aqueous phase within 1 ns. However, a significant number of center dot OH radicals became trapped at the lipid headgroup region for a longer period. The possible implications for membrane-based nitration and oxidation processes were discussed."
"The molecular mechanism for noncholinergic toxicity of phosphamidon, an extensively used organophosphate pesticide, is still not clear. The aim of the present study is to find the possible molecular mechanism of this pesticide to induce apoptosis and the role of different drugs for attenuation of such effects. Human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were incubated with increasing concentrations of phosphamidon (0-20 mu M) for 6-24 h. The MTT assay reveals that phosphamidon induces cytotoxicity in a dose-dependent manner. Cellular glutathione (GSH) is depleted in a dose-dependent manner from 55% to 70% at concentrations between 10 and 20 mu M. The percentage of cells that bind to Annexin-V, which is a representative of cells either undergoing apoptosis or necrosis during 24 h incubation, increases in a dose-dependent manner. Above 5 mu M, significant necrosis of cells was observed. DNA fragmentation assay revealed that at low concentration of phosphamidon (1 mu M), no appreciable change in DNA fragmentation was seen; however, distinct fragmentation was observed beyond 2.5 mu M. Phosphamidon was found to cause significant depletion of GSH, which correlates well with the percentage of cells undergoing apoptosis. An increasing trend in levels of cytochrome c was observed with increasing concentration of phosphamidon, indicating that the apoptotic effect of phosphamidon is mediated through cytochrome c release. Coadministration of the antioxidants N-acetylcysteine and curcumin attenuated phosphamidon-induced apoptosis. This further supports our hypothesis that oxidative stress, as indicated by GSH depletion, results in the induction of apoptosis by release of cytochrome c. (C) 2010 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

"Purpose: To evaluate the recurrence patterns in a series of patients who presented with isolated locoregional recurrences (ILRRs) after mastectomy and adjuvant systemic therapies in the contemporary era. Methods: A total of 235 patients who developed ILRRs between 2005 and 2013 were classified into subgroups based on nodal status, hormone receptor status, and biologic subtype. The annual frequency of recurrences, association between biologic subtype and interval to recurrence (ITR), and anatomical distribution were evaluated. Results: For the entire group, recurrence peaked within the first 3 years after mastectomy, and then decreased significantly with time. Node-positive patients were observed to recur early, and a greater proportion recurred within 5 years (86.7% vs. 72.8%, X-2 = 6.83, P = 0.008) than did node-negative subgroup. Overall, the median ITR was 33.2 (range, 4.5 - 236) months. Biologic subtype specific median ITR were 43.3 (7.9 - 236.0) months for luminal A, 42.2 (6.1 - 143.3) months for luminal B, 23.8 (6.9 - 47.3) months for luminal HER2, 18.2 (6.6 - 117.5) months for HER2, and 21.8 (4.5 - 138.2) months for TNBC, and their difference was statistically significant (X-2 = 7.4, P = 0.001). Among all ILRRs, 51.5% (n = 121) were isolated to regional nodes. Conclusions: We demonstrates that the time course is consistent with previous description, biologic subtype is associated with ITR, and regional nodes is the most common place for recurrences in this series of patients who developed ILRRs following mastectomy and contemporary adjuvant systemic therapies but without PMRT."
"Background: Intracranial atherosclerotic stenosis (ICAS) is an important cause of ischemic stroke worldwide. The role of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) or low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) in the development of ICAS remains to be elucidated. In the current study, we investigated the relationship of HDL-C level and the risk of developing ICAS in Chinese patients with acute ischemic stroke. Methods: From October 2007 to June 2009, a total of 1,984 consecutive ischemic stroke patients were evaluated for the presence of symptomatic ICAS by magnetic resonance angiography (MRA). Patients were classified into two groups: intracranial steno-occlusion (ICAS group, n = 888) and non-intracranial stenosis (NICAS group, n = 1096). Serum lipid profiles were analyzed and compared between the ICAS and NICAS group. Results: Significantly more patients in ICAS group had low HDL-C level (51.6%) than in the NICAS group (42.9%, P < 0.001). The observed association remained significant after adjustment for conventional risk factors [(adjusted OR 1.36; 95% CI (1.13-1.63)]. Such predictive value of low level HDL-C persisted even when LDL-C was at very low level(< 1.8 mmol/L). Patients in the lowest serum HDL-C quartile (< 0.96 mmol/L) had the highest risk of developing ICAS [adjusted OR 1.52; 95% CI (1.17-1.98)] compared to patients in the highest serum HDL-C quartile (>= 1.32 mmol/L) after adjustments for the covariates. Conclusions: Low HDL-C level is strongly associated with the development of ICAS. There was an inverse relationship between the level of HDL-C and the risk of developing ICAS."
"Purpose: Financial capacity (FC) is an instrumental activity of daily living (IADL) critical to independent functioning and sensitive to cognitive impairment in dementia. Little is known about FC in cognitively impaired patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). The present study investigated FC in PD patients with prodromal and clinical dementia. Methods: Participants were 20 older controls and 35 PD patients who met consensus criteria for either mild cognitive impairment (PD-MCI, n = 18) or PD dementia (PDD, n = 17). FC was assessed using a standardized performance based measure consisting of 9 domain and two global scores (Financial Capacity Instrument; FCI) (1). FCI domain and global performance scores were compared across groups. Capacity impairment ratings (no impairment, mild/moderate impairment, severe impairment) were calculated for each PD patient's domain and global scores. Results: Relative to controls, PD-MCI patients were impaired on both FCI global scores and domains of basic monetary skills, financial concepts, and investment decision-making. Relative to both controls and PD-MCI patients, PDD patients were impaired on virtually all FCI variables. With respect to impairment ratings, greater than 50% of PD-MCI patients and greater than 90% of PDD patients were classified as either mild/moderate or severely impaired on the two FCI global scores. Conclusions: Impairment of financial capacity is already present in PD-MCI and is advanced in PDD. Complex cognitively-mediated IADLs such as financial capacity appear to be impaired early in the course of PD dementia. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."
"Apolipoprotein CIII (apoCIII) has been reported to be tightly associated with triglyceride metabolism and the susceptibility to coronary artery disease (CAD). Besides, apoCIII has also been found to affect the anti-apoptotic effects of HDL. However, the effect of apoCIII on HDL-mediated cholesterol efflux, the crucial function of HDL, has not been reported. A hospital-based case-control study was conducted to compare the apoCIII distribution in lipoproteins between CAD patients and nonCAD controls and to explore the relationship between HDL-associated apoCIII (apoCIII(HDL)) and HDL-mediated cholesterol efflux. One hundred forty CAD patients and nighty nine nonCAD controls were included. Plasma apoCIII, apoCIII(HDL) and cholesterol efflux capacity was measured. The apoCIII(HDL) ratio (apoCIII(HDL) over plasma apoCIII) was significantly higher in CAD patients than that in control group (0.52 +/- 0.24 vs. 0.43 +/- 0.22, P = 0.004). Both apoCIII(HDL) and apoCIII(HDL) ratio were inversely correlated with cholesterol efflux capacity (r = -0.241, P = 0.0002; r = -0.318, P < 0.0001, respectively). Stepwise multiple regression analysis revealed that the apoCIIIHDL ratio was an independent contributor to HDL-mediated cholesterol efflux capacity (standardized beta = -0.325, P < 0.001). This study indicates that the presence of apoCIII in HDL may affect HDL-mediated cholesterol efflux capacity, implying the alternative role of apoCIII in the atherogenesis."
"An aqueous two-phase extraction (ATPE) process based on a PEG/phosphate system was developed for the capture of human immunoglobulin G and successfully applied to a Chinese hamster ovary and a PER.C6(R) cell supernatant. A continuous ATPE process incorporating three different steps (extraction, back-extraction, and washing) was set up and validated in a pump mixer-settler battery. Most of the higher molecular weight cell supernatant impurities were removed during the extraction step, while most of the lower molecular weight impurities were removed during the subsequent steps. A global recovery yield of 80% and a final protein purity of more than 99% were obtained for the IgG purification from a CHO cell supernatant, representing a 155-fold reduction in the protein/IgG ratio. For the purification of IgG from a PER.C6(R) cell supernatant, a global recovery yield of 100%, and a host cell protein purity were attained, representing a 22-fold reduction in the host cell proteins/IgG ratio. These results, thus, open promising perspectives for the application of the developed ATPE process as a platform for the capture of antibodies. In fact, this new process has shown the ability to successfully recover and purify different antibodies from distinct cell culture supernatants. This technology can also overcome some of the limitations encountered using the typical chromatographic processes, besides inherent advantages of scalability, process integration, capability of continuous operation, and economic feasibility."
"Background: The Wnt signaling pathway is involved in the control of cell proliferation and differentiation during skeletal muscle development. Secreted frizzled-related proteins (SFRPs), such as SFRP1, function as inhibitors of Wnt signaling. MicroRNA-1/206(miRNA-1/206) is specifically expressed in skeletal muscle and play a critical role in myogenesis. The miRNA-mRNA profiles and bioinformatics study suggested that the SFRP1 gene was potentially regulated by miRNA-1/206 during porcine skeletal muscle development. Methods: To understand the function of SFRP1 and miRNA-1/206 in swine myogenesis, we first predicted the targets of miRNA-1/206 with the TargetScan and PicTar programs, and analyzed the molecular characterization of the porcine SFRP1 gene. We performed a temporal-spatial expression analysis of SFRP1 mRNA and miRNA-206 in Tongcheng pigs (a Chinese indigenous breed) by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction, and conducted the co-expression analyses of SFRP1 and miRNA-1/206. Subsequently, the interaction between SFRP1 and miRNA-1/206 was validated via dual luciferase and Western blot assays. Results: The bioinformatics analysis predicted SFRP1 to be a target of miRNA-1/206. The expression level of the SFRP1 was highly varied across numerous pig tissues and it was down-regulated during porcine skeletal muscle development. The expression level of the SFRP1 was significantly higher in the embryonic skeletal compared with postnatal skeletal muscle, whereas miR-206 showed the inverse pattern of expression. A significant negative correlation was observed between the expression of miR-1/206 and SFRP1 during porcine skeletal muscle development (p < 0.05). Dual luciferase assay and Western-blot results demonstrated that SFRP1 was a target of miR-1/206 in porcine iliac endothelial cells. Conclusions: Our results indicate that the SFRP1 gene is regulated by miR-1/206 and potentially affects skeletal muscle development. These findings increase understanding of the biological functions and the regulation of the SFRP1 gene in mammals."
"A cop wants to locate a robber hiding among the vertices of a graph. A round of the game consists of the robber moving to a neighbor of its current vertex (or not moving) and then the cop scanning some vertex to obtain the distance from that vertex to the robber. If the cop can at some point determine where the robber is, then the cop wins; otherwise, the robber wins. We prove that the robber wins on graphs with girth at most 5. We also improve the bounds on a problem of Seager by showing that the cop wins on a subdivision of an n-vertex graph G when each edge is subdivided into a path of length m, where m is the minimum of n and a quantity related to the ""metric dimension"" of G. We obtain smaller thresholds for complete bipartite graphs and grids. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."
An independent origin of the left vertebral artery from the aortic arch is the second most common aortic arch anomaly and occurs in 7% of otherwise healthy persons. Bilateral and independent origins of vertebral arteries are distinctly unusual. We present and illustrate such a case.
"Rainfall is the most fundamental variable of the terrestrial hydrological cycle. However, in many regions of the world, ground observations are still very scarce or even missing. Recently, a bottom-up approach, named SM2RAIN, for terrestrial rainfall estimation from satellite soil moisture (SM) products was proposed and successfully applied to C- and L-band products from scatterometers and radiometers. Thanks to the multiple Ku-band scatterometers launched in the recent years and a number of new sensors expected in the near future, accurate rainfall estimation at subdaily time scale could be obtained. We present here a first attempt to estimate terrestrial rainfall from Ku-band scatterometers using SM2RAIN. To this end, backscattering data (sigma-0) collected in central Italy from the RapidScat instrument on board the International Space Station are compared with the Advanced SCATterometer (ASCAT, C-band) SM product and in situ observations for assessing its sensitivity to SM variations. Then, RapidScat sigma-0 is used for rainfall retrieval and compared with ground observations over a regular grid of 15-km spacing. The 8-month period from Nov 2014 to Jun 2015 is considered. Results show a very good agreement between ASCAT SM and RapidScat SM index with a median temporal correlation coefficient R of similar to 0.9 and a reasonable performance (R > 0.52) against in situ data. More interestingly, the performance of RapidScat in 1-day rainfall estimation is found to be satisfactory with median R-values equal to similar to 0.6. These promising results highlight the large potential of using the constellation of scatterometers for providing an accurate rainfall product with high spatial-temporal resolution."
"Objective: To evaluate the frequency of adverse events (AEs) across 4 treatment conditions in the Child/Adolescent Anxiety Multimodal Study (CAMS), and to compare the frequency of AEs between children and adolescents. Method: Participants ages 7 to 17 years (mean = 10.7 years) meeting the DSM-IV criteria for 1 or more of the following disorders: separation anxiety disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, or social phobia were randomized (2:2:2:1) to cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT, n = 139), sertraline (SRT, n = 133), a combination of both (COMB, n = 140), or pill placebo (PBO, n = 76). Data on AEs were collected via a standardized inquiry method plus a self-report Physical Symptom Checklist (PSC). Results: There were no differences between the double-blinded conditions (SRT versus PBO) for total physical and psychiatric AEs or any individual physical or psychiatric AEs. The rates of total physical AEs were greater in the SRT-alone treatment condition when compared to CBT (p < .01) and COMB (p < .01). Moreover, those who received SRT alone reported higher rates of several physical AEs when compared to COMB and CBT. The rate of total psychiatric AEs was higher in children (<= 12 years) across all arms (31.7% versus 23.1%, p < .05). Total PSC scores decreased over time, with no significant differences between treatment groups. Conclusion: The results support the tolerability/safety of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) treatment for anxiety disorders even after adjusting for the number of reporting opportunities, leading to no differences in overall rates of AEs. Few differences occurred on specific items. Additional monitoring of psychiatric AEs is recommended in children (<= 12 years)."
"Arterial tissue consists of multiple structurally important constituents that have individual material properties and associated stress-free configurations that evolve over time. This gives rise to residual stresses contributing to the homoeostatic state of stress in vivo as well as adaptations to perturbed loads, disease or injury. The existence of residual stresses in an intact but load-free excised arterial segment suggests compressive and tensile stresses, respectively, in the inner and outer walls. Accordingly, an artery ring springs open into a sector after a radial cut. The measurement of the opening angle is commonly used to deduce the residual stresses, which are the stresses required to close back the ring. The opening angle method provides an average estimate of circumferential residual stresses but it gives no information on local distributions through the thickness and along the axial direction. To address this lack, a new method is proposed in this article to derive maps of residual stresses using an approach based on the contour method. A piece of freshly excised tissue is carefully cut into the specimen, and the local distribution of residual strains and stresses is determined from whole-body digital image correlation measurements using an inverse approach based on a finite element model."
"The miniaturization of crystal resonators and filters toward the micro electromechanical systems (MEMS) and nano-structured scales demands improvement of nonlinear piezoelectricity theory and a better understanding of the nonlinear behavior of new crystal materials. The nonlinearities affect the quality factor and acoustic behavior of MEMS and nano-structured resonators and filters. Among these nonlinear effects, drive-level dependence (DLD), which describes the instability of the resonator frequency resulting from voltage level and/or power density, is a potentially significant problem for miniaturized resonators. Langasite, a promising new piezoelectric material, is of current interest for a variety of applications because of its good temperature behavior, good piezoelectric coupling, low acoustic loss, and high Q-factor. It has been recently used to make high-temperature MEMS. In this paper, we report experimental measurements of the DLD of langasite resonators with different resonator configurations (plano-plano, single bevel, and double bevel). The results show that the resonator configuration affects the DLD of the langasite resonator. The DLD measurement results for langasite are compared with literature values for quartz, langaniste, and langatate, and with additional new measurements for a GaPO4 resonator of type R-30 (-11.1 degrees rotated Y-cut). Uncertainty analysis for the measured drive-level sensitivity is performed as well."
"Laser autocollimation is innovated for absolute angular position measurement based on an optical frequency comb. The conventional laser autocollimation can only make relative angle measurement due to the unknown angular distance between the incident laser beam and the axis of the autocollimation unit. In the proposed absolute laser autocollimation employed with the femtosecond laser autocollimator, in which a femtosecond laser and a diffraction grating are employed as the measurement light source and the reflector, respectively, a new method is proposed for accurate identification of the angular distance through taking use of first-order diffracted beams from the reflector associated with the optical frequency comb of the femtosecond laser source. With the identified angular distance, the absolute angular position of the grating reflector, which is defined by the angle between the normal axis of the reflector surface and the incident laser beam, can be determined from the information of optical frequencies of the first-order diffracted beams based on the fact that each of the first-order diffracted beams from the grating reflector has a deterministic angular position corresponding to the optical frequency of each comb mode of the femtosecond laser. Principle of the proposed absolute laser autocollimation and an experimental setup as well as experimental results demonstrating the effectiveness and potentiality of the proposed method are presented."
"Conventional dynamic voltage and frequency scaling techniques use high CPU utilization as a predictor for user dissatisfaction, to which they react by increasing CPU frequency. In this paper, we demonstrate that for many interactive applications, perceived performance is highly dependent upon the particular user and application, and is not linearly related to CPU utilization. This observation reveals an opportunity for reducing power consumption. We propose Human and Application driven frequency scaling for Processor Power Efficiency (HAPPE), an adaptive user-and-application-aware dynamic CPU frequency scaling technique. HAPPE continuously adapts processor frequency and voltage to the learned performance requirement of the current user and application. Adaptation to user requirements is quick and requires minimal effort from the user (typically a handful of key strokes). Once the system has adapted to the user's performance requirements, the user is not required to provide continued feedback but is permitted to provide additional feedback to adjust the control policy to changes in preferences. HAPPE was implemented on a Linux-based laptop and evaluated in 22 hours of controlled user studies. Compared to the default Linux CPU frequency controller, HAPPE reduces the measured system-wide power consumption of CPU-intensive interactive applications by 25 percent on average while maintaining user satisfaction."
"We show how it is possible to assess the rate of convergence in the Gaussian approximation of triangular arrays of U-statistics, built from wavelets coefficients evaluated on a spherical Poisson field of arbitrary dimension. For this purpose, we exploit the Stein-Malliavin approach introduced in the seminal paper by Peccati, Sole, Taqqu and Utzet (2011); we focus in particular on statistical applications covering evaluation of variance in non-parametric density estimation and Sobolev tests for uniformity.

"Epithelia are sheets of connected cells that are essential across the animal kingdom. Experimental observations suggest that the dynamical behavior of many single-layered epithelial tissues has strong analogies with that of specific mechanical systems, namely large networks consisting of point masses connected through spring-damper elements and undergoing the influence of active and dissipating forces. Based on this analogy, this work develops a modeling framework to enable the study of the mechanical properties and of the dynamic behavior of large epithelial cellular networks. The model is built first by creating a network topology that is extracted from the actual cellular geometry as obtained from experiments, then by associating a mechanical structure and dynamics to the network via spring-damper elements. This scalable approach enables running simulations of large network dynamics: the derived modeling framework in particular is predisposed to be tailored to study general dynamics (for example, morphogenesis) of various classes of single-layered epithelial cellular networks. In this contribution, we test the model on a case study of the dorsal epithelium of the Drosophila melanogaster embryo during early dorsal closure (and, less conspicuously, germband retraction)."

"Crystalline structure and optoelectrical properties of silver-doped tin monoxide thin films with different dopant concentrations prepared by DC magnetron sputtering are investigated. The X-ray diffraction patterns reveal that the tetragonal SnO phase exhibits preferred orientations along (101) and (110) planes. Our results indicate that replacing Sn2+ in the SnO lattice with Ag+ ions produces smaller-sized crystallites, which may lead to enhanced carrier scattering at grain boundaries. This causes a deterioration in the carrier mobility, even though the carrier concentration improves by two orders of magnitude due to doping. In addition, the Ag-doped SnO thin films show a p-type semiconductor behavior, with a direct optical gap and decreasing transmittance with increasing Ag dopant concentration."
"Alkali metal-based sorbents are potential for oxidized mercury (Hg2+) selective adsorption but show hardly effect to elemental mercury (Hg-0) in flue gas. Density functional theory (DFT) was employed to investigate the Hg-0 and HgCl2 adsorption mechanism over alkali metal-based sorbents, including calcium oxide (CaO), magnesium oxide (MgO), potassium chloride (KCI) and sodium chloride (NaCl). Hg-0 was found to weakly interact with CaO (001), MgO (001), KCl (001) and NaCI (001) surfaces while HgCl2 was effectively adsorbed on top-O and top-Cl sites. Charge transfer and bond population were calculated to discuss the covalency and ionicity of HgCl2 bonding with the adsorption sites. The partial density of states (PDOS) analysis manifests that HgCl2 strongly interacts with surface sites through the orbital hybridizations between Hg and top 0 or CI. Frontier molecular orbital (FMO) energy and Mulliken electronegativity are introduced as the quantitative criteria to evaluate the reactivity of mercury species and alkali metal-based sorbents. HgCl2 is identified as a Lewis acid and more reactive than Hg-0. The Lewis basicity of the four alkali metal-based sorbents is predicted as the increasing order: NaCl < MgO < KCI < CaO, in consistence with the trend of HgCl2 adsorption energies.

"Stuart Hall's work on culture, representation, ideology and hegemony positions Hollywood as a cultural institution informed by and informative of US social values and norms. Thus contemporary debates over Hollywood's diversity are indicative of broader social conflicts. Empirically the article examines 2014-2015 news coverage of Hollywood to question the Hollywood paradoxthe lack of diversity in film/TV production yet TV's increasing shift towards on-screen diversity. It maps three discursive frames: Hollywood exceptionalism, economic imperatives, and institutionalized racism and sexism. The article concludes by using Hulu's East Los High to reflect on TV's digital turn and innovative models in production and representation."
"We report a novel approach to generating full-duty-cycle triangular waveforms based on a microwave photonic filter (MPF) with negative coefficient. It is known that the Fourier series expansion of a triangular waveform has only odd-order harmonics. In this work, the undesired even-order harmonics are suppressed by the MPF that has a periodic transmission response. A triangular waveform at fundamental frequency can be generated by setting the bias of a Mach-Zehnder modulator (MZM) at quadrature point. However, it is found that a broadband 90 degrees microwave phase shifter has to be used after photodetection to adjust the phases of odd-order harmonics. Alternatively, a frequency doubling triangular waveform can be generated by setting the bias of the MZM at maximum or minimum transmission point. This approach is more promising because the broadband microwave phase shifter is no longer required in this case but it is more power consuming. The proposed approach is theoretically analyzed and experimentally verified. (C) 2014 Optical Society of America"
"The aim of this study was to identify changes in the plant species richness, diversity and composition of a mountain hay meadow (alliance Polygono bistortae-Trisetion flavescentis) after abandonment in comparison with a control cut once per year. The experiment was carried out from 1999 to 2008 in a mountain hay meadow in the Bukovec nature reserve in the north-eastern part of the Jizera Mountains (Jizerske hory, Gory Izerskie, Isergebirge), Czech Republic. The number of vascular plants species with cover greater than or equal to 1% remained almost the same throughout the study period: however, the total number of vascular plants was higher in the cut treatment after the first four years of the study. The cover of Festuca rubra,Agrostis capillaris, Anthoxanthum odoratum, Briza media and Trifolium repens was positively affected by cutting. On the other hand, the cover of Cirsium heterophyllum, Geranium sylvaticum, Hypericum maculatum, Trisetum flavescens and Luzula luzuloides was higher on the abandoned treatment plots. The main effect of the abandonment on plant species composition was the shift in cover of the dominant species. Despite ten years of contrasting management, changes in the vegetation were relatively small with no shift to a different plant community. Therefore the cutting regime combined with several years of no management may be a suitable management strategy for the maintenance of Polygono-Trisetion grasslands and will not be detrimental to the preservation of the target vegetation.

"Tetramethyl ammonium hydroxide (TMAH) is a corrosive and toxic chemical with a stable structure. Therefore, it is important to check whether surface water or wastewater contains TMAH. In addition to using ultrasound and ozone procedures to degrade TMAH in wastewater, in this study, the effects of TMAH degradation were explored by combining the two procedures while varying the reaction conditions. According to the experimental results, the degradation efficiency of TMAH by the single ultrasonic process was un-satisfactory, and the highest degradation ratio was only 8.4% after for 60 min, while the highest total organic carbon (TOC) mineralization ratio was only 7.1%. Ozonation is more effective for the degradation of TMAH, where the highest TMAH removal rate and mineralization rate can reach 58.4% and 21.8%, respectively. As the ultrasound is combined with the ozone procedure (named as sonozone) at the optimal condition, the TMAH removal ratio reaches 89.5% following by mineralization ratio of 77.5%. The toxicity test performed using the cell survival rate showed that ozonation and sonozone have better effects for improving the cell viability and reducing the toxicity of the water sample, and the sonozone process proves that the combination of two procedures indeed has synergistic oxidation efficiency."
"BACKGROUND The American Society of Dermatologic Surgery (ASDS) is the major educational organization for dermatologic surgery in the United States. Presidents are elected annually from among their members. OBJECTIVE The authors investigated the demographics, training, and achievements of the ASDS presidents. MATERIALS AND METHODS All ASDS presidents (1970-2017) were included. Data were gathered using publicly available information from websites, curriculum vitae, and PubMed. Living presidents were contacted by email (if available) to verify the collected data. RESULTS Of 46 ASDS presidents, 87% are male, with the first female president elected in 1994. Fifty-nine percent are members of the American College of Mohs Surgery. Seven presidents received dual fellowship training. Four presidents received a second graduate degree. Mean duration from residency to presidency was 22 years, with the mean age being 53 years. PubMed publication average was 34. All presidents have been affiliated with academic institutions, with 26% appointed as department chair and 30% serving as academic dermatologic surgery director. CONCLUSION The authors report that most of the ASDS presidents have been male with over half receiving Mohs surgery fellowship training. All have had academic affiliations at some point in their careers, with some named department chairs and/or elected as presidents of other national dermatologic societies."
"This paper is concerned with the problem of estimating covariances of inhomogeneous second-order reweighted stationary spatial point processes when the intensity of the spatial point process has a parametric form. The proposed estimator is based on kernel techniques. It is a very simple and fast estimator which in addition does not require one to model second and higher moments of the spatial point process. Under very mild assumptions, mainly on characteristics of the point process, we prove the mean squared consistency of our estimator. Finally, we show in a simulation study that the kernel-based covariance estimator outperforms existing methods when it is applied to build confidence intervals of the intensity.

"The paper is devoted to the evaluation of limit of detection CLOD) and limit of quantification (LOQ) values in concentration domain by using 4 different approaches; namely 3 sigma and 10 sigma approaches, ULA2 approach, PBA approach and MDL approach. Brief theoretical analyses of all above mentioned approaches are given together with directions for their practical use. Calculations and correct calibration design are exemplified by using of electrothermal atomic absorption spectrometry for determination of lead in drinking water sample. These validation parameters reached 1.6 mu g L-1 (LOD) and 5.4 mu g L-1 (LOQ) by using 3 sigma and 10 sigma approaches. For obtaining relevant values of analyte concentration the influence of calibration design and measurement methodology were examined. The most preferred technique has proven to be a method of preconcentration of the analyte on the surface of the graphite cuvette (boost cycle). (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."
"In this work polymer/clay nanocomposites from blends with PA6 matrix were developed. Torque rheometry was used to evaluate the reactivity of different copolymers with PA6 and their influence on the PA6/clay system. The nanocomposites were characterized by X-ray Diffraction (XRD), Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC), mechanical properties and Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM). Torque rheometry analysis showed that the PEgAA copolymer exhibited the highest reactivity with PA6 while the EG copolymer showed better interaction with the PA6/Clay system. XRD results indicated that PA6/CL20A system presented intercalated structure, while PA6/EG/CL20A systems presented a partially exfoliated structure. XRD and DSC analyses indicated that PA6/EG/CL20A system where the clay was pre-intercalated in PA6, the clay was located in the PA6 phase while in the system where the clay was pre-intercalated in the EG copolymer, the clay was located in the EG phase. The PA6/EG/CL20A system where the clay was pre-intercalated into PA6 presented balanced modulus and impact strength properties when compared to PA6. SEM tests showed that the clay is well dispersed in the PA6/CL20A and PA6/EG/CL20A systems."
"The Rho-associated serine-threonine protein kinase (ROCK) is a downstream effector of Rho GTPases that is frequently activated in the epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) of human ovarian cancer cells. On the other hand, endothelin-1 (ET-1) and its receptor endothelin A receptor (ETAR) are overexpressed in primary and metastatic ovarian carcinoma, which suggests that ET-1 promotes tumor dissemination. Hence, two human ovarian carcinoma cell lines, SK-OV-3 and CaOV3, were chosen to study the effects of ET-1/ETAR and ROCK in promoting EMT of ovarian cancer cells. We found that ET-1 exposure induced EMT of SK-OV-3 and CaOV3 by monitoring cells morphology, enhanced fibronectin, and reduced E-cadherin protein. At the same time, ET-1/ETAR enhanced the level of transcription of SLUG a transcriptional repressor of E-cadherin. More importantly, a constitutively active mutant of ROCK enhanced the transcription of SLUG by stimulating SLUG promoter activity. Furthermore, ROCK inhibitor Y27632 reversed the increase in fibronectin induced by ET-1/ETAR. Our data suggest that ROCK cooperated with ET-1/ETAR to promote EMT of human ovarian carcinoma cells through upregulation of SLUG mRNA."
"Objective: To investigate the socio-economic differentials underlying minimum dietary diversity (MDD) among children aged 6-23 months in three economically diverse South-East Asian countries. Design: The outcome variable MDD was defined as the proportion of children aged 6-23 months who received foods from four of the seven recommended food groups within the 24 h prior to interview. The association between socio-economic factors and MDD, adjusting for relevant characteristics, was examined using logistic regression. Setting: We used cross-sectional population data from recent Demographic and Health Surveys from Cambodia (2014), Myanmar (2015-16) and Indonesia (2012). Subjects: Total of 8364 children aged 6-23 months. Results: Approximately half of all children met the MDD, varying from 47.7 % in Cambodia (n 1023) to 58.2 % in Indonesia (n 2907) and 24.6 % in Myanmar (n 301). The likelihood (adjusted OR; 95 % CI) of meeting MDD increased for children in the richest households (Cambodia: 2.4; 1.7, 3.4; Myanmar: 1.8; 1.1, 3.0; Indonesia: 2.0; 1.6, 2.5) and those residing in urban areas (Cambodia: 1.4; 1.1, 1.9; Myanmar: 1.7; 1.2, 2.4; Indonesia: 1.7; 1.5, 1.9). MDD deprivation was most severe among children from the poorest households in rural areas. The association between mother's labour force participation and MDD was positive in all three countries but reached significance only in Indonesia (1.3; 1.1, 1.5). Conclusions: MDD deprivation among young children was significantly high in socio-economically disadvantaged families in all three study settings. MDD requirements are not being met for approximately half of young children in these three South-East Asian countries."
"Sulfated N- and O-glycans carried on a myriad of cell-surface adhesion molecules and receptors are often not detected by current approaches in mass spectrometry (MS)-based glycomic mapping of cells and tissues. This is in part due to a natural lower abundance, compounded further by their negatively charged nature, which adversely disfavors their ionization and detection amid a sea of often much more abundant, nonsulfated, sialylated glycans. However, this particular limitation can actually be taken advantage of to effect highly selective enrichment and sensitive MS screening in negative ion mode, provided the ubiquitous sialic acids can first be neutralized. It has been demonstrated that permethylation not only fulfills this role adequately but further confers better MS/MS fragmentation characteristics for more efficient structural mapping and sequencing. Protocols and general practical considerations are described here which would enable one to readily prepare permethylated sulfated glycans, fractionate them away from the more abundant nonsulfated ones in simple steps for high-sensitivity MS analysis, and sensibly interpret the initial sulfoglycomic screening data thus obtained."
"This work presents the proof-of-concept of an electric traction power system with a high temperature polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cell range extender, usable for automotive class electrical vehicles. The hybrid system concept examined, consists of a power system where the primary power is delivered by a lithium ion battery pack. In order to increase the run time of the application connected to this battery pack, a high temperature PEM (HTPEM) fuel cell stack acts as an on-board charger able to charge a vehicle during operation as a series hybrid. Because of the high tolerance to carbon monoxide, the HTPEM fuel cell system can efficiently use a liquid methanol/water mixture of 60%/40% by volume, as fuel instead of compressed hydrogen, enabling potentially a higher volumetric energy density. In order to test the performance of such a system, the experimental validation conducted uses a down-sized version of the battery pack used in the Mitsubishi iMiEV, which is subjected to power cycles derived from simulations of the vehicle undergoing multiple New European Drive Cycles (NEDC).

"Complex network analyses of functional connectivity have consistently revealed non-random (modular, small-world, scale-free-like) behavior of hard-thresholded networks constructed from the right-tail of the similarity histogram. In the present study we determined network properties resulting from edges constrained to specific ranges across the full correlation histogram, in particular the left (negative-most) tail, and their dependence on the confound signal removal strategy employed. In the absence of global signal correction, left-tail networks comprised predominantly long range connections associated with weak correlations and were characterized by substantially reduced modularity and clustering, negative assortativity and gamma<1 Deconvolution of specific confound signals (white matter, CSF and motion) resulted in the most robust within-subject reproducibility of global network parameters (ICCs similar to 0.5). Global signal removal altered the network topology in the left tail, with the clustering coefficient and assortativity converging to zero. Networks constructed from the absolute value of the correlation coefficient were thus compromised following global signal removal since the different right-tail and left-tail topologies were mixed. These findings informed the construction of soft-thresholded networks, replacing the hard thresholding or binarization operation with a continuous mapping of all correlation values to edge weights, suppressing rather than removing weaker connections and avoiding issues related to network fragmentation. A power law adjacency function with beta = 12 yielded modular networks whose parameters agreed well with corresponding hard-thresholded values, that were reproducible in repeated sessions across many months and evidenced small-world-like and scale-free-like properties.

"Targeting microRNAs (miRNAs) with drug small molecules (SMs) is a new treatment method for many human complex diseases. Unsurprisingly, identification of potential miRNA-SM associations is helpful for pharmaceutical engineering and disease therapy in the field of medical research. In this paper, we developed a novel computational model of HeteSim-based inference for SM-miRNA Association prediction (HSSMMA) by implementing a path-based measurement method of HeteSim on a heterogeneous network combined with known miRNA-SM associations, integrated miRNA similarity, and integrated SM similarity. Through considering paths from an SM to a miRNA in the heterogeneous network, the model can capture the semantics information under each path and predict potential miRNA-SM associations based on all the considered paths. We performed global, miRNA-fixed local and SM-fixed local leave one out cross validation (LOOCV) as well as 5-fold cross validation based on the dataset of known miRNA-SM associations to evaluate the prediction performance of our approach. The results showed that HSSMMA gained the corresponding areas under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUCs) of 0.9913, 0.9902, 0.7989, and 0.9910 +/- 0.0004 based on dataset 1 and AUCs of 0.7401, 0.8466, 0.6149, and 0.7451 +/- 0.0054 based on dataset 2, respectively. In case studies, 2 of the top 10 and 13 of the top 50 predicted potential miRNA-SM associations were confirmed by published literature. We further implemented case studies to test whether HSSMMA was effective for new SMs without any known related miRNAs. The results from cross validation and case studies showed that HSSMMA could be a useful prediction tool for the identification of potential miRNA-SM associations."
"We investigated the effects of melatonin administration on ovariectomy-induced oxidative toxicity and N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) subunits in the blood of rats. Thirty-two rats were studied in three groups. The first and second groups were control and ovariectomized rats. Melatonin was daily administrated to the ovariectomized rats in the third group for 30 days. Blood, brain cortical and hippocampal samples were taken from the three groups after 30 days. Brain cortical, erythrocyte and plasma lipid peroxidation (LP) levels were higher in the ovariectomized group than in controls, although the LP level was decreased in the ovariectomized group with melatonin treatment. Brain cortical and plasma concentrations of vitamins A, C and E as well as the NMDAR 2B subunit were lower in the ovariectomized group than in controls, although, except for plasma vitamin C, they were increased by the treatment. Brain cortical and erythrocyte reduced glutathione (GSH) levels were lower in the ovariectomized group than in controls, although erythrocyte GSH levels were higher in the melatonin group than in the ovariectomized group. Brain cortical and erythrocyte glutathione peroxidase activity and NMDAR 2A subunit concentrations were not found to be different in all groups statistically. Oxidative stress has been proposed to explain the biological side effect of experimental menopause. Melatonin prevents experimental menopause-induced oxidative stress to strengthen antioxidant vitamin and NMDAR 2A subunit concentrations in ovariectomized rats."
"Background and Purpose Patients with major depressive disorder receiving racemic ketamine, (R,S)-ketamine, experience transient increases in Clinician-Administered Dissociative States Scale scores and a coincident drop in plasma d-serine levels. The results suggest that (R,S)-ketamine produces an immediate, concentration-dependent pharmacological effect on d-serine plasma concentrations. One potential source of this effect is (R,S)-ketamine-induced inhibition of the transporter ASCT2, which regulates intracellular d-serine concentrations. In this study, we tested this hypothesis by examining the effect of (S)- and (R)-ketamine on ASCT2-mediated transport of d-serine in PC-12 and 1321N1 cells and primary neuronal cells in culture. Experimental Approach Intracellular and extracellular d-serine levels were determined using capillary electrophoresis-laser-induced fluorescence and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry respectively. Expression of ASCT2, Asc-1 and serine racemase was determined utilizing Western blotting. Key Results (S)-Ketamine produced a concentration-dependent increase in intracellular d-serine and reduced extracellular d-serine accumulation. In contrast, (R)-ketamine decreased both intracellular and extracellular d-serine levels. The ASCT2 inhibitor, benzyl-d-serine (BDS), and ASCT2 gene knockdown mimicked the action of (S)-ketamine on d-serine in PC-12 cells, while the Asc-1 agonist d-isoleucine reduced intracellular d-serine and increased extracellular d-serine accumulation. This response to d-isoleucine was not affected by BDS or (S)-ketamine. Primary cultures of rat neuronal cells expressed ASCT2 and were responsive to (S)-ketamine and BDS. (S)- and (R)-ketamine increased the expression of monomeric serine racemase in all the cells studied, with (S)-ketamine having the greatest effect. Conclusions and Implications (S)-Ketamine decreased cellular export of d-serine via selective inhibition of ASCT2, and this could represent a possible source of dissociative effects observed with (R,S)-ketamine."
"Currently, the American College of Gastroenterology requires identification of goblet cells in mucosal biopsies from the esophagus to diagnose Barrett esophagus (BE). Identification of goblet cells in mucosal biopsies is fraught with limitations such as sampling and interpretation error. One previous study by our group suggested that MUC2 expression in esophageal nongoblet columnar cells represents a late biochemical reaction in the conversion of mucinous columnar cells to goblet cells in BE. We conducted this study to evaluate the prevalence, sensitivity, and specificity of MUC2 positivity in nongoblet columnar epithelium for detection of goblet cells in the distal esophagus and gastroesophageal junction (GEJ) region. We also sought to identify associations between MUC2 positivity and clinical and endoscopic risk factors for BE. This analysis utilized mucosal biopsies of the distal esophagus or GEJ from 100 patients who participated in a community clinic-based study of patients with chronic gastroesophageal reflux disease evaluated prospectively in the western part of Washington state. We randomly selected 50 patients who had columnar epithelium with goblet cells, representing the study group and 50 patients without goblet cells, representing the comparison group. Immunohistochemistry for MUC2 was performed on samples in a blinded manner without knowledge of the clinical or endoscopic features of the patients. The presence of staining was noted in both goblet and nongoblet epithelium, both close to and distant from the mucosa with goblet cells, when the latter were present. All study patients showed MUC2 positivity in goblet cells. MUC2 was present in nongoblet columnar epithelium in 78% of study patients with goblet cells, but in only 4% of controls without goblet cells (P < 0.0001) (sensitivity, 78%; specificity, 96% for goblet cell metaplasia). MUC2 was significantly more common in nongoblet columnar cells close to, rather than distant from, the mucosa with goblet cells (P < 0.00001). Finally, MUC2 was significantly associated with endoscopic evidence of columnar metaplasia in the distal esophagus, and with known risk factors for BE, such as older age, white race, frequent heartburn, and elevated body mass index. We conclude that goblet cells likely develop from a field of MUC2-positive mucinous columnar cells, and as such, MUC2 represents a late event in the development of goblet cells. MUC2 staining in nongoblet columnar cells is a reasonably sensitive and highly specific marker for goblet cells in the distal esophagus and GEJ, and its presence is predictive of endoscopic columnar metaplasia of the esophagus, even in patients without goblet cells."
"Ultrasonic joining of copper foil to 1100 aluminum sheet at nominal joining temperatures of 298 K to 413 K (25 A degrees C to 140 A degrees C) for 1.25 second caused significant copper diffusion into the aluminum sheet, indicating very high diffusivity (D) values of 1.54 x 10(-13) to 2.22 x 10(-13) m(2)/s. The D values reflect high excess vacancy concentrations caused by the rapid plastic deformation in the joining surfaces. A method is presented to estimate the actual values of interface temperature from the diffusion data and expected values of vacancy concentrations. The estimated values of interface temperature were about 390 to 410 deg below the equilibrium melting point of aluminum, and in agreement with reported experimental values."

"Defensins are small effector molecules of the innate immune system that are present in almost all organisms including plants and animals. These peptides possess antimicrobial activity against a broad range of microbes including bacteria, fungi and viruses and act as endogenous antibiotics. alpha-Defensins are a subfamily of the defensin family and their expression is limited to specific tissues. Equine DEFA1 is an enteric alpha-defensin exclusively secreted by Paneth cells and shows an activity against a broad spectrum of microbes, including typical pathogens of the horse such as Rhodococcus equi, various streptococci strains, Salmonella choleraesuis, and Pasteurella multocida. Here, we report the three-dimensional structure of DEFA1 solved by NMR-spectroscopy and demonstrate its specific function of aggregating various phospholipids. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

"The partitioning behavior of catalase from white rot fungus Phanerochaete chrysosporium has been studied in various poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG)-salt aqueous two phase systems (ATPSs). The effects of the molecular weight of the PEG, system composition and salt type besides NaCl concentration as a non-phase forming component and pH of the system on catalase partitioning were investigated at 25 degrees C. In all of the investigated ATPSs, catalase showed affinity to the top phase. The best partition parameters were found in the PEG 1000 18%-K2HPO4 12% (w/w, pH 8.2) system when there was no addition of non-phase forming salt, NaCl. For the optimized ATPS, partition coefficient of total catalase activity (K-e) and partition coefficient of total protein concentration (K-p) were determined as 10.55 and 0.21, respectively. In this system, the yield (Y-t) was found as 91.95% and the purity of the catalase enzyme from P. chrysosporium was increased to 5.72 with the recovery (R-t) of 81.96% in the top phase. The optimized ATPS proved to be a useful technique for the initial purification of catalase as an alternative to the traditional ones. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."
"Children from low-socioeconomic backgrounds tend to fall progressively further behind their higher-income peers over the course of their academic careers. Music training has been associated with enhanced language and learning skills, suggesting that music programs could play a role in helping low-income children to stay on track academically. Using a controlled, longitudinal design, the impact of group music instruction on English reading ability was assessed in 42 low-ncome Spanish-English bilingual children aged 6-9 years in Los Angeles. After one year, children who received music training retained their age-normed level of reading performance while a matched control group's performance deteriorated, consistent with expected declines in this population. While the extent of change is modest, outcomes nonetheless provide evidence that music programs may have value in helping to counteract the negative effects of low-socioeconomic status on child literacy development."
"As we know, the notion of dissipativity is an important dynamical property of neural networks. Thus, the analysis of dissipativity of neural networks with time delay is becoming more and more important in the research field. In this paper, the authors establish a class of fractional-order complex-valued neural networks (FCVNNs) with time delay, and intensively study the problem of dissipativity, as well as global asymptotic stability of the considered FCVNNs with time delay. Based on the fractional Halanay inequality and suitable Lyapunov functions, some new sufficient conditions are obtained that guarantee the dissipativity of FCVNNs with time delay. Moreover, some sufficient conditions are derived in order to ensure the global asymptotic stability of the addressed FCVNNs with time delay. Finally, two numerical simulations are posed to ensure that the attention of our main results are valuable. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."
"Aims Thoracic aortic calcification (TAC) is measured by computed tomography (CT). We investigated the association of TAC-progression with incident cardiovascular (CV) events and all-cause mortality in a population-based cohort and to determine its predictive value for these endpoints. Methods and results In 3080 participants (45-74 years, 53.6% women), risk factors and TAC via CT were measured at baseline and at a second examination after 5.1 +/- 0.3 years. Hard coronary, hard CV events as well as CV events including revascularization and all-cause mortality were recorded during a follow-up time of 7.8 +/- 2.2 years after the second CT scan. Cox regression analysis determined the association of TAC-progression with observed endpoints. The predictive value of TAC-progression was assessed using Harrell's C index. We observed 81 hard coronary, 154 hard CV, 231 CV events including revascularization, and 266 deaths. In the crude analysis, event rates increased continuously with the level of TAC-change over 5 years for all endpoints. After adjustment, the significant association of TAC-progression with hard CV events [hazard ratio (HR) 1.28, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.05-1.57] and all-cause mortality (HR 1.34, 95% CI 1.14-1.58) persisted, per one standard deviation increase in TAC-progression (log(TAC+1)). Regarding aortic segments separately, HRs were consistently higher for descending thoracic aorta. When adding TAC (baseline and progression) to the model containing classical risk factors and coronary artery calcification (CAC), Harrell's C indices did not increase for any of the observed endpoints. Conclusion TAC-progression is associated with incident hard CV events and all-cause mortality but fails to improve event prediction over CAC."
"Tool life enhancement with improved machining performance of existing turning inserts during hard turning process is an essential industrial requirement to reduce the manufacturing cost and to improve the surface finish with higher accuracy. The objective of this paper is to study the effects of Deep Cryogenic Cooling on coated tungsten carbide inserts and to evaluate their tool wear and resulting surface finish by conducting turning experiments on P20 tool steel material. To evaluate these properties, turning experiments were carried out as per the Taguchi's design of experiments technique, by considering the three experimental parameters namely turning speed, depth of cut and feed rate. The effect of these parameters on tool wear and surface finish of the workpiece are analyzed by analysis of variance technique. The results indicated that feed rate had the highest influence of 71.85% on the surface finish of the machined surface, whereas the depth of cut influenced 14.86% & followed by turning speed which had 4.91% influence on surface finish. Similarly, for tool wear, it was found that turning speed had a significance value of 39.95% on tool wear followed by the depth of cut (37.95%) and feed rate (18.85%). The experimental data were used to develop the regression correlations for surface finish, and tool wear and confirmation tests were carried out to validate the models. The comparison between predicted and experimental values indicated a maximum deviation of around +/- 8% for surface roughness and +/- 11% for the observed tool wear. And scanning electron microscopic analysis of deep cryogenic treated inserts indicates a homogeneous distribution eta-carbides in cobalt matrix and a grain size refinement of alpha-phase compared to untreated inserts."
"Rice bran is a major by-product of the rice milling process that contains high amounts of fiber, proteins, fats, vitamins, minerals as well as antioxidants and hence can be utilized in enriching food products. The main aim followed in this study was to determine the effects of rice bran of variable particle sizes (53, 125 and 210 mu m) and its quantity (0, 5, 10, 15 and 20%) on the quality of batter and on sponge cake. Increasing bran quantity and particle size increased batter density and consistency. Using a higher quantity of bran with larger particle sizes increased cake density and weight of the cakes (after being baked) while decreasing the cake volume. Textural properties of the samples as determined instrumentally showed that maximum compressive force and the firmness increased, while cohesiveness and springiness decreased with increase in the contents of bran and increase in its particle size. Cake crust color became darker, more reddish and less yellowish with inclusion of rice bran. Increasing the levels of rice bran, negatively affected taste, crust and crumb color as confirmed by the sensory panel. Overall, it was found that addition of 10% rice bran with particle size of 125 mu m resulted in the most desirable cake quality."
Prebiotics such as short-chain fructo-oligosaccharides (scFOS) have been shown to modify colonic microflora composition and activity in many humans and some animal species However little data are available on their fermentation characteristics by the ileal microbial community and their effects on the small intestinal microflora composition The aim of this study was to evaluate the in vitro fermentability of scFOS by deal bacteria and the effect of scFOS on concentrations of the total anaerobic bacteria Lactobacilli Streptococci Bifidobacteria and Clostridium perfringens in veal calf deal contents Two groups of 4 calves fed a finisher milk replacer and fibrous pellets were sacrificed 5 h after the morning meal In each group deal contents were pooled and diluted with Lowe s medium Two amounts of scFOS (100 and 250 mg) were tested in vitro versus a control (0 mg scFOS) Each bottle was incubated in duplicate for each treatment and each time point at 37 degrees C in a shaking water bath Bacterial concentrations were determined at 0 3 6 and 9 h and pH gas production volatile fatty acids (VFA) and lactate concentrations were measured every 1 5 h for 9 h Over time scFOS fermentation resulted in more gas production (P=0 055) higher total VFA concentrations (P<0 01) an increase in L lactate concentration (P<0 01) as well as a lower pH value (P<0 01) than the control bottle Acetate and butyrate concentrations increased (P<0 01) with scFOS fermentation ScFOS fermentation enhanced growth of Lactobacilli (P=0 010) Streptococci (P=0 015) and lactic acid utilizing bacteria (P=0 025) C perfnngens concentration was not affected by scFOS addition Based on our results scFOS was fermented by bacteria of deal contents in veal calves and its fermentation led to a selective stimulation of host bacteria However further studies are needed to determine impacts of scFOS on C perfnngens concentration in veal calf deal contents (C) 2010 Elsevier B V All rights reserved
"A variety of techniques have been reported in the literature for the incorporation of attachments in implant-retained partial and complete overdentures with unsplinted or individual abutments. Three important elements that are necessary in describing any technique for incorporation of attachments are the type of final impression method (tissue-level impression, abutment-level impression, or implant-level impression), stage of overdenture fabrication (record base stage, denture-processing stage, or denture insertion stage) and nature of technique (direct or indirect). This article reviews 7 different techniques for the incorporation of attachments in implant-retained complete and partial overdentures. Discussion of indications, contraindications, advantages, and disadvantages of each technique is provided to aid the clinician in making an appropriate choice. (J Prosthet Dent 2012;107:288-299)"
"Conjugation experiments with Bacillus thuringiensis and transfer kinetics demonstrated that salt stress has a positive impact on plasmid transfer efficiency. Compared to standard osmotic conditions (0.5% NaCl), plasmid transfer occurred more rapidly, and at higher frequencies (>100-fold), when bacteria were exposed to a high-salt stress (5% NaCl) in liquid brain heart infusion (BHI). Under milder salt conditions (2.5% NaCl), only a 10-fold effect was observed in Luria-Bertani broth and no difference was detected in BHI. These observations are particularly relevant in the scope of potential gene exchanges among members of the Bacillus cereus group, which includes food-borne contaminants and pathogens."
"Heart failure (HF) causes dysfunction of the atrioventricular node (AVN) - first or second-degree heart block is a risk factor for sudden cardiac death in HF patients. The aim of the study was to determine if HF causes remodelling of the AVN and right atrioventricular ring (RAVR). HF was induced in rats (n=4) by ligation of the proximal left coronary artery, which resulted in a large infarct of the left ventricle. Sham-operated rats (n=4) were used as controls. Eight weeks after surgery, functional experiments were performed and the hearts were frozen. The body weight of HF rats was similar to control rats, but the mean heart weight of HF rats was significantly enlarged. In HF rats compared to controls, the left ventricle was dilated, left ventricular end-diastolic pressure elevated (21.0 +/- 0.6 and 5.4 +/- 0.2 mm Hg), left ventricular ejection fraction reduced (0.2 +/- 0.02 and 0.5 +/- 0.02) and left ventricular end-systolic pressure reduced (102 +/- 4.2 and 127 +/- 3.1 mm Hg). In HF rats, the in vivo and in vitro PR intervals were increased (41% and 20%), as was the Wenckebach cycle length, indicative of AVN dysfunction. The collagen content was significantly increased in the AVN and RAVR indicating fibrosis. Immunolabelling of caveolin3 (cell membrane marker) showed that there was hypertrophy in HF (cell diameter was increased by 63%, 39% in AVN, RAVR). The TUNEL assay showed that the myocytes of the AVN and RAVR in HF undergo apoptotic cell death. Immunolabelling showed that expression of HCN4 was significantly decreased in the AVN and RAVR (43% and 47%) in HF. We conclude that in HF there is remodelling of the AVN and RAVR and this remodelling may explain the AVN dysfunction."
"Smart city initiatives rely on real-time measurements and data collected by a large number of heterogenous physical sensors deployed throughout a city. Physical sensors, however, are fraught with interoperability, dependability, management and political challenges. Furthermore, these sensors are unable to sense the opinions and emotional reactions of citizens that invariably impact smart city initiatives. Yet everyday, millions of dwellers and visitors of a city share their observations, thoughts, feelings and experiences, or in other words, their perceptions about their city through social media updates. This paper reasons why ""human sensors"", namely, citizens that share information about their surroundings via social media can supplement, complement, or even replace the information measured by physical sensors. We present a methodology based on probabilistic language modeling to extract and visualize such perceptions that may be relevant to smart cities from social media updates. Using more than six million geo-tagged tweets collected over regions that feature widely varying geographical, social, cultural and political characteristics and tweet densities, we illustrate the potential of social media enabled human sensing to address diverse smart city challenges."
"Potential role of angiotensin-II and cyclooxygenase have been suggested in the pathophysiology of chronic fatigue stress. The present study has been designed to evaluate the neuroprotective effect of losartan and its interaction with nimesulide against chronic fatigue stress and related complications in mice. In the present study, male Laca mice (20-30 g) were subjected to running wheel activity test session (RWATS) for 6 min daily for 21 days. Losartan, nimesulide and their combinations were administered daily for 21 days, 45 min before being subjected to RWATS. Various behavioral and biochemical and neuroinflammatory mediators were assessed subsequently. 21 days RWATS treatment significantly decreased number of wheel rotations/6 min indicating fatigue stress like behaviors as compared to naive group. 21 days treatment with losartan (10 and 20 mg/kg, ip), nimesulide (5 and 10 mg/kg, po) and their combinations significantly improved behavior [increased number of wheel rotations, reversal of post-exercise fatigue, locomotor activity, antianxiety-like behavior (number of entries, latency to enter and time spent in mirror chamber), and memory performance (transfer latency in plus-maze performance task)], biochemical parameters (reduced serum corticosterone, brain lipid peroxidation, nitrite concentration, acetylcholinesterase activity, restored reduced glutathione levels and catalase activity) as compared to RWATS control. Besides, TNF-alpha, CRP levels were significantly attenuated by these drugs and their combinations as compared to control. The present study highlights the role of cyclooxygenase modulation in the neuroprotective effect of losartan against chronic fatigue stress-induced behavioral, biochemical and cellular alterations in mice."
"Some substances of technological importance reveal phase change phenomena in the pressure and temperature range typically applied in biotechnology and food processing. For example, media with high molar volumes like edible oils and fats undergo liquid-solid phase transition at pressure increases up to several hundred megapascals. This article is concerned with theoretical considerations of the line of coexistence of solid and liquid phases in the pressure and temperature domain that corresponds to the phase boundary as a function of temperature and pressure. A universal model equation based on the equilibrium thermodynamics allowing prediction of the phase transition line of homogeneous media with high molar volume is presented. Approximate solutions of the model equation are discussed, which allow the phase boundary of substances with high molar volume to be described by a linear relation at least sequentially. The methods of experimental determination of the phase boundary under high pressure are presented and an attempt is made to validate the theoretical model with respect to the experimental data."
"Tumor-induced osteomalacia (TIO) is a rare acquired form of hypophosphatemic osteomalacia, which is usually attributed to the overproduction of fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF-23) by benign mesenchymal neoplasms. Localization and thereafter surgical resection of tumors lead to a cure. The present study aimed to investigate the clinical data, diagnostic methods, and follow-up after tumor resection at one medical center in Shanghai to characterize the profile of this rare disorder and to share our successful experience in diagnosis and treatment. Twentythree patients with adult-onset hypophosphatemia osteomalacia seen in Shanghai Sixth People's Hospital from 2009 to 2014 and 95 normal individuals were enrolled. After taking a medical history and performing a physical examination, we analyzed the laboratory results (including the serum FGF-23 levels) and localized the tumors by 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography and computed tomography (18F-FDG PET/CT), (99)mT-coctreotide ((99)mT-c-OCT) scintigraphy, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). On the basis of the results of laboratory tests and imaging findings, tumor resection was conducted in 17 patients with a certain diagnosis of TIO. The results demonstrated that the 17 patients (nine men and eight women, average age 46.6 +/- 12.9 years) had TIO. FGF-23 level was elevated in 94.1 % of patients (16 of 17 patients). Serum phosphorus level decreased in 100 % of patients. F-18-FDG PET/CT revealed five tumors, (99)mT-cOCT scintigraphy revealed two tumors, physical examination revealed nine tumors, and MRI revealed one tumor, among which 58.8 % of the causative tumors (10 of 17 tumors) were located in the lower extremities. After tumor resection, serum phosphorus levels normalized in 100 % of patients (all 17 patients) in 4-21 days and FGF-23 levels decreased in 90 % of patients (nine of ten patients). We found 64.7 % of the tumors (11 of 17 tumors) were phosphaturic mesenchymal tumors or a phosphaturic mesenchymal tumor mixed connective tissue variant. Measurement of serum phosphorus and FGF-23 levels in patients with suspected TIO is of paramount importance for diagnosing of TIO. F-18-FDG PET/ CT, (99)mTc-OCT scintigraphy, and physical examination play a considerable role in revealing TIO-associated tumors. TIO-associated tumors were more frequently located in the lower extremities than in other places; thus, the lower extremities need to be carefully checked. Complete surgical resection results in normalization of parameters in laboratory tests and relief of symptoms of TIO patients."
"Mn+-implanted alpha-SiO2-samples were studied with the help of soft X-ray emission and absorption spectroscopy (Si L-2.3 3d3s -> 2p(3/2,1/2) and Mn L-2.3 3d4s -> 2P(3/2,1/2) emission transitions) using synchrotron excitation. The samples were obtained using a pulsed ion source (ion beam current density similar to 2-7 mA/cm(2), E-impl. = 30 keV, ion fluence similar to 2 x 10(17) cm(-2), pulse duration 400 mu s) without thermal annealing. It was established that Mn-ion provides a formal valence state 2+, so arranging in implanted alpha-SiO2 the low-sized MnO antiferromagnetic clusters probably of crystalline type. The data obtained well coincides with the electronic spin resonance results reported earlier. Crown Copyright (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."
"The first RNA recognition motif of the Drosophila SNF protein is an example of an RNA binding protein with multi-specificity. It binds different RNA hairpin loops in spliceosomal U1 or U2 small nuclear RNAs, and only in the latter case requires the auxiliary U2A' protein. Here we investigate its functions by crystal structures of SNF alone and bound to U1 stem-loop II, U2A' or U2 stem-loop IV and U2A', SNF dynamics from NMR spectroscopy, and structure-guided mutagenesis in binding studies. We find that different loop-closing base pairs and a nucleotide exchange at the tips of the loops contribute to differential SNF affinity for the RNAs. U2A' immobilizes SNF and RNA residues to restore U2 stem-loop IV binding affinity, while U1 stem-loop II binding does not require such adjustments. Our findings show how U2A' can modulate RNA specificity of SNF without changing SNF conformation or relying on direct RNA contacts."
"Rampant activity of the hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1 in cancer is frequently associated with the malignant progression into a harder-to-treat, increasingly aggressive phenotype. Clearly, anti-HIF strategies in cancer cells are of considerable clinical interest. One way to fine-tune, or inhibit, HIF's transcriptional outflow independently of hydroxylase activities could be through competing transcription factors. A CACGTG-binding activity in human hepatoma cells was previously found to restrict HIF's access to hypoxia response cis-elements (HRE) in a Daphnia globin gene promoter construct (phb2). The CACGTG factor, and its impact on hypoxia-responsive human genes, was analyzed in this study by genome-wide computational scans as well as gene-specific quantitative PCR, reporter and DNA-binding assays in hepatoma (Hep3B), cervical carcinoma (HeLa), and breast carcinoma (MCF7) cells. Among six basic helix-loop-helix transcription factors known to target CACGTG palindromes, we identified upstream stimulatory factor (USF)-1/2 as predominant phb2 CACGTG constituents in Hep3B, HeLa, and MCF7 cells. Human genes with adjacent or overlapping HRE and CACGTG motifs included with lactate dehydrogenase A (LDHA) and Bcl-2/E1B 19 kDa interacting protein 3 (BNIP3) hypoxia-induced HIF-1 targets. Parallel recruitment of HIF-1 alpha and USF1/2a to the respective promoter chromatin was verified for all cell lines investigated. Mutual complementing (LDHA) or moderating (BNIP3) cross-talk was seen upon overexpression or silencing of HIF-1 alpha and USF1/2a. Distinct (LDHA) or overlapping (BNIP3) promoter-binding sites for HIF-1 and USFs were subsequently characterized. We propose that, depending on abundance or activity of its protein constituents, O-2-independent USF signaling can function to fine-tune or interfere with HIF-mediated transcription in cancer cells.

"This paper considers the elastic analysis of a functionally graded transversely isotropic tri-material solid under the arbitrary distribution of applied static loads. Using two displacement potential functions, for three-dimensional point-load and patch-load configurations, Green's functions for displacement and stress components are generated in the form of infinite line-integrals. These solutions are shown to be analytically reducible to the special cases of exponentially graded bi-material, exponentially graded half-space and homogeneous tri-material Green's functions. It also encompasses a functionally graded finite layer on a rigid base with surface loading with two cases of interfacial conditions, rigid-bonded and rigid-frictionless. Finally, for the special case of a functionally graded layer sandwiched between two homogeneous layers, using several numerical displays, the effect of material inhomogeneity on the responses is studied and the accuracy of numerical scheme is verified.

"Both the post-order heap and the M-heap have a full binary tree structure and have constant amortized insertion and O(logn) deletion time complexities. This paper proposes a simple array version of the M-heap, called AM-heap. The AM-heap has a complete binary tree structure and its array indexing scheme is the same as the simple indexing scheme of the conventional binary heap. An insertion on an AM-heap takes constant amortized time and a deletion takes O(logn) time where n is the number of elements in an AM-heap. The AM-heap resolves the open problem that is to design an array version of the M-heap. Also, it is simpler than the post-order heap to implement and debug."
"Bio-based membranes were obtained using Polyamide 11 (PA11) from renewable sources and a nano-hybrid composed of halloysite nanotubes (HNTs) filled with lysozyme (50 wt % of lysozyme), as a natural antimicrobial molecule. Composites were prepared using an electrospinning process, varying the nano-hybrid loading (i.e., 1.0, 2.5, 5.0 wt %). The morphology of the membranes was investigated through SEM analysis and there was found to be a narrow average fiber diameter (0.3-0.5 mu m). The mechanical properties were analyzed and correlated to the nano-hybrid content. Controlled release of lysozyme was followed using UV spectrophotometry and the release kinetics were found to be dependent on HNTs-lysozyme loading. The experimental results were analyzed by a modified Gallagher-Corrigan model. The application of the produced membranes, as bio-based pads, for extending the shelf life of chicken slices has been tested and evaluated."
"Successful pharmaceutical drug development requires finding correct doses. The issues that conventional dose-response analyses consider, namely whether responses are related to doses, which doses have responses differing from a control dose response, the functional form of a dose-response relationship, and the dose(s) to carry forward, do not need to be addressed simultaneously. Determining if a dose-response relationship exists, regardless of its functional form, and then identifying a range of doses to study further may be a more efficient strategy. This article describes a novel estimation-focused Bayesian approach (BMA-Mod) for carrying out the analyses when the actual dose-response function is unknown. Realizations from Bayesian analyses of linear, generalized linear, and nonlinear regression models that may include random effects and covariates other than dose are optimally combined to produce distributions of important secondary quantities, including test-control differences, predictive distributions of possible outcomes from future trials, and ranges of doses corresponding to target outcomes. The objective is similar to the objective of the hypothesis-testing based MCP-Mod approach, but provides more model and distributional flexibility and does not require testing hypotheses or adjusting for multiple comparisons. A number of examples illustrate the application of the method."
"The title compound, C18H13NO2S, has two independent molecules (A and B) with similar conformations in the asymmetric unit. Both phenothiazine moieties have a butterfly structure [dihedral angles between benzene rings = 155.17 (7) and 161.71 (7)degrees, respectively], and the central six-membered rings have a boat form. In the crystal, the A and B molecules stack alternately along the b axis. The A and B molecules are linked by O-H center dot center dot center dot O = S hydrogen bonds, forming zigzag chains along [10 (1) over bar]."
"L-1-norm based low rank matrix factorization in the presence of missing data and outliers remains a hot topic in computer vision. Due to non-convexity and non-smoothness, all the existing methods either lack scalability or robustness, or have no theoretical guarantee on convergence. In this paper, we apply the Majorization Minimization technique to solve this problem. At each iteration, we upper bound the original function with a strongly convex surrogate. By minimizing the surrogate and updating the iterates accordingly, the objective function has sufficient decrease, which is stronger than just being non-increasing that other methods could offer. As a consequence, without extra assumptions, we prove that any limit point of the iterates is a stationary point of the objective function. In comparison, other methods either do not have such a convergence guarantee or require extra critical assumptions. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real data sets testify to the effectiveness of our algorithm. The speed of our method is also highly competitive."
"Using a home-made cryotarget system and infrared spectroscopy system, we measure the infrared absorption spectra of liquid hydrogen at low temperaturs. It is found that the fundamental vibration frequency of hydrogen molecule is 4237.3 cm(-1). As liquid hydrogen cools from 19.75 K down to 16.75 K, the infrared absorption is enhanced. The vibration frequency of hydrogen molecules is calculated on the basis of non-harmonic approximation in order to explain the experimental ones."
"Lithium-rich transition metal oxides are attractive cathode materials providing high energy densities for lithium-ion batteries. A layer-structured Li2RuO3-LiCoO2 composite was synthesized by the solid-state reaction method. In the as-prepared composite, Li2RuO3 component not only serves as the electrochemical active phase providing large reversible capacity, but also improves the structural stability of layered LiCoO2 at high potential. Electrochemical measurements show the composite has high reversible specific capacity and good capacity retention. Particularly, the initial discharge specific capacity can reach 240 mA h/g at current density of 0.13 C between 2.0 V and 4.5 V. It also exhibits an excellent cycling stability with capacity retention of 75% after 50 cycles. The present work suggests choosing appropriate transition metal M and M' for Li2MO3-LiM'O-2 composite should be an efficient strategy for designing new cathode materials. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

"BACKGROUND: Violence against children from school staff is anecdotally common in low-and middle-income countries, but data on prevalence and associations with mental health and educational outcomes are lacking. METHODS: We report data from a cross-sectional survey conducted in June and July 2012 in Luwero District, Uganda. Forty-two primary schools representing 80% of students in the district were randomly selected; 100% agreed to participate. The International Society for the Prevention of Child Abuse and Neglect Child Abuse Screening Tool-Child Institutional; Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire; and reading, spelling, and math tests were administered. We present descriptive statistics and logistic regression models, accounting for the complex sampling scheme used in the survey. RESULTS: We surveyed 3706 students and 577 school staff members; 93.3% (SE 1.0%) of boys and 94.2% (SE 1.6%) of girls attending primary school reported lifetime experience of physical violence from a school staff member, and.50% reported experience in the past week. Past-week physical violence was associated with increased odds of poor mental health and, for girls, double the odds of poor educational performance (adjusted odds ratio = 1.78, 95% confidence interval = 1.19-2.66). For boys, significant interactions were present. CONCLUSIONS: Despite a ban on corporal punishment in Ugandan schools since 1997, the use of violence against students is widespread and associated with poor mental health and educational performance. School violence may be an important but overlooked contributor to disease burden and poor educational performance in low-and middle-income settings."
"Background/Aim. Thoracic surgery is in need of a widely recognized and dependable risk model which could prospectively make objective conclusions and retrospectively allow comparison of outcomes. Thoracoscore is the first model with multiple variables developed for predicting inhospital mortality following pulmonary resections. It is integrated in the British Thoracic Society and National Institute of Health and Clinical Excellence guidelines. However, additional evaluation of Thoracoscore is considerably advised in order to demonstrate its validity and potentially make it a dependable tool for thoracic surgeons across the world. Our study assesses the accuracy of Thoracoscore scoring system in estimating in-hospital mortality in patients undergoing pulmonary resections. Methods. Between September 2013 and October 2014 data were retrospectively collected on 196 patients operated on at the Thoracic Surgery Clinic, Institute of Pulmonary Diseases of Vojvodina. The procedures performed were: pneumonectomies, lobectomies and modified lobectomies (including bilobectomy and sleevelobectomy), Wedge resections and atypical resections. The Thoracoscore was calculated based on these nine variables: age, sex, American Society of Anaesthesiologists' (ASA) class, performance status classification, dyspnea score, priority of surgery, procedure class, diagnosis group and comorbidities score. Results. Study included one hundred and ninety-six patients, average age of 62 +/- 9 years, and 61% were males. Predicted mean in-hospital mortality was 3.6 +/- 3.2% 95% confidence interval (CI) 3.16-4.06, and mean actual in-hospital mortality was 6/196 (3.1%) (95% CI 1.78-4.42). Patients who were > 65 years old contributed to 3/6 (50%) of in-hospital mortality, and 4/6 (67%) were males. Four of 6 (67%) patients underwent pneumonectomy due to malignant pathology. Thoracoscore was divided into 4 risk groups: low (0-3), moderate (3.1-5), high (5.1-8) and very high (> 8). The correlation between observed and expected mortality was 0.99, by category of risk. Old age, male gender and malignancy showed to be strong indicators of in-hospital mortality. Conclusion. At our department Thoracoscore presented with good performance and as a practical tool for predicting in-hospital mortality among patients undergoing lung resections. However, any risk scoring system needs further validation before implementation and outcomes must be compared to those of other programs."
"In this paper, a sensorless speed estimation method with an artificial neural network for squirrel cage induction motors is presented. Motor current is generally used for sensorless speed estimation. Rotor slot harmonics are available in the frequency spectrum of the current. The frequency components of these determined harmonics are used to estimate the speed of the motor in which the number of rotor slots is given. In the literature, individual algorithms have been used to calculate the speed from the slot harmonics. Unlike the literature, in the proposed method, an artificial neural network is used to extract the speed from the rotor slot harmonic components in the spectrum. This experimental study is carried out to prove the method under steady-state conditions. The experimental results show that the proposed method is suitable for speed estimation and its average error is below 1.5 rpm."
"In this paper we discuss the multi-facility location problem on networks with positive and negative weights. As the finite dominating set for the single facility problem does not carry over to the multifacility problem, we derive a new finite dominating set. To solve the problem, we present a straightforward algorithm. Moreover, for the problem with just two new facilities, we show how to obtain a more efficient solution procedure by using planar arrangements. We present computational results to underline the efficiency of the improved algorithm and to test some approximations which are based on a reduced candidate set. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

The formation of ordered structures of macro- and microcrystalline waxes during cooling from the melt of bitumen was observed using temperature-modulated differential scanning calorimetry. This process develops in time. It is found that steric hardening of bitumen (gradual hardening at room temperature) is related to the processes of formation of ordered structures of bitumen waxes.
"In this work we introduce a facile procedure that allows a highly conformal coating of self-organized TiO2 nanotubes (NTs) with a graphite-like thin carbon layer. This provides a platform to enhance the functionality of TiO2 nanotubes for a wide range of applications. Here we show that such modified nanotubes can serve as a 3D scaffold for an ideal decoration with RuO2 nanoparticles. Used as 3D pseudocapacitor electrode, capacitance values of up to 80 times higher than plain TiO2 NTs, and a very high yield of utilization of RuO2 (872 F g(-1)) and excellent long-term cycling stability can be reached."
"An influence of various humic-plant feed additives based on some herbs (nettle, chamomile, yarrow, perforatum), lucerne and humic materials on biochemical indices of Lohmann Brown (LB) layers blood plasma was estimated. Hens were housed in deep litter system, 20 birds in a group. Four groups were formed: control (C - standard feeding), and experimental, supplemented with preparations: E-1 herbal-humic, E-2 humic-herbal and E-3 - humic-lucerne. Hens were placed in the pens on the 16th week of life, addition of preparations with standard food mixture started at the 22nd wk and lasted until 66th wk of life. Blood for analyses was collected four times in the following periods: 27, 37, 54 and 65th wk of life. The applied humic-plant preparations to a limited degree affected the values of examined biochemical parameters in serum: total protein (TP), albumins (Albs), glucose (Glu), urea, triacylglycerols (TAG), total cholesterol (TCh), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alkaline phosphatase (ALP). It is difficult to determine based on these study, which preparation is one the most active biologically, however is seems that humic-lucerne preparation affected the examined blood parameters to the highest degree. The reference values ranges in hens blood serum LB hens were proposed for: TP (43-65 g/l, Albs (15-22 g/l), urea (0.5-1.2 mmol/l), Glu 10-15 mmol/l), TCh (2.2-4.5 mmol/l), TAG (10-24 mmol/l), AST (4-12 U/l), ALT (150-280 mmol/l) and ALP (190-350 U/l)."
"A novel nano in situ gel forming system of 5-Fluorouracil (5-FU) was investigated for its potential use for conjunctival/corneal squamous cell carcinoma (CCSC). The study was conducted in two steps, in the first step PLA nanoparticles were prepared and characterized; in the second step the drug loaded PLA nanoparticles were dispersed in sodium alginate solution yielding the modified nano in situ system, which were evaluated in rabbit eye. Size and morphology of prepared PLA particles were verified by using dynamic light scattering (DLS), atomic force microscope (AFM) and scanning electron microscope (SEM). In vitro and in vivo study of free 5-FU, PLA nanoparticles and modified nano in situ system were conducted in simulated tear fluid and in rabbit eye respectively. PLA nanoparticles were in size range of 128-194 nm with spherical shape and smooth surface with narrow size distribution. No polymer drug interaction was found as confirmed by FTIR, NMR and DSC. XRD of PLA nanoparticles confirmed that 5-FU was present in the crystalline state. In vitro experiments indicated a diffusion controlled release of 5-FU from both PLA nanoparticles and modified nano in situ system with high burst effect. Modified nano in situ gel system (MNS) significantly increased the Cmax and AUC0-8 in aqueous humor as compared to 5-FU solution and PIA nanoparticles. Higher 5-FU level in aqueous humor was possibly because of increased retention time of gel matrix-embedded drug loaded nanoparticles. Overall results showed the potential of MNS for ophthalmic delivery in the therapy of CCSC. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."
"The intermittency of renewable energy will increase the uncertainty of the power system, so it is necessary to predict the short-term wind power, after which the electrical power system can operate reliably and safely. Unlike the traditional point forecasting, the purpose of this study is to quantify the potential uncertainties of wind power and to construct prediction intervals (PIs) and prediction models using wavelet neural network (WNN). Lower upper bound estimation (LUBE) of the PIs is achieved by minimizing a multi-objective function covering both interval width and coverage probabilities. Considering the influence of the points out of the PIs to shorten the width of PIs without compromising coverage probability, a new, improved, multi-objective artificial bee colony (MOABC) algorithm combining multi-objective evolutionary knowledge, called EKMOABC, is proposed for the optimization of the forecasting model. In this paper, some comparative simulations are carried out and the results show that the proposed model and algorithm can achieve higher quality PIs for wind power forecasting. Taking into account the intermittency of renewable energy, such a type of wind power forecast can actually provide a more reliable reference for dispatching of the power system."
"Compliance with food group and nutrient recommendations, and self-efficacy, stage of change, perceived barriers and benefits for healthy eating were assessed among a convenience sample of college students majoring in health-related disciplines. Dietary and psychosocial data were collected using three-day food records and scales, respectively. Means (SD), frequencies, and percents were calculated on all data, and logistic regressions were used to determine whether any of the psychosocial correlates predicted the stage of change for healthy eating. Noncompliance with food group recommendations ranged from 53% for the meat/meat alternates group to 93% for the vegetables/juice group, whereas noncompliance with nutrient recommendations ranged from 26% for cholesterol to 99% for potassium. A majority of students (57%) self-classified in the preaction and 40% in the action stages of change for eating healthy. The students' self-efficacy to eat healthy was highest in positive/social situations and lowest when experiencing emotional upset. The most important perceived barrier to healthy eating was that friends/roommates do not like to eat healthy foods, and the most important perceived benefit was that eating healthy foods provides the body with adequate nutrients. The difficult/inconvenient self-efficacy subscale predicted the stage of change for healthy eating. These students would benefit from interactive learning opportunities that teach how to purchase and prepare more whole grain foods, fruits, and vegetables, enhance their self-efficacy for making healthy food choices when experiencing negative emotions, and overcome perceived barriers to healthy eating."
"Introduction: Bulky dermoid cysts of the floor of the mouth are very rare and may pose a problem of diagnosis. They also raise problems for the anesthesiologist and surgeon. We report the first case to be described in Togo. Case report: A 23-year-old man was admitted for a submental submandibular sublingual mass. It was soft, depressable, painless, without adenopathies, raising the tongue against the palate and creating a ""second tongue-like"" aspect. Resection on intra-oral route removed an intactcyst of 13 cm long axis. Histology diagnosed dermoid cyst. Discussion: Dermoid cysts of the floor of the mouth present as a submental sublingual mass, which may cause dyspnea and disorders of swallowing, chewing and/or vocal function. Differential diagnosis concerns sublingual, submental and cervical masses. Definitive diagnosis is founded on the histology specimen. Imaging may assist diagnosis. Intubation may be problematic. The resection approach may be intra-oral or cervical. Conclusion: Dermoid cysts of the floor of the mouth are rare. They may induce functional disorder. An intra-oral approach is preferable when possible. (C) 2013 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved."
"This work is primarily inspired by the observation that supervisory control and regulated rewriting have the same nature. Indeed, both of them model a system using some formalism and use a certain formalized control structure to restrict the behavior of the system via some designated control mechanisms. In this paper, we propose the theory of Control Systems (C Systems), which provides a more generic framework to integrate the automaton and grammar representations of control in supervisory control and regulated rewriting. The C system contains two components: the controlled component and the controlling component. The two components are expressed using the same formalism, e.g. automata or grammars. More specifically, we define three types of control systems based on the automaton or grammar representation, namely Automaton Control Systems (AC Systems), Grammar Control Systems (GC Systems) and Leftmost-derivation-based Grammar Control Systems (LGC Systems). We formally study their key theoretical characterizations, such as generative power, equivalence and translation techniques, as well as their connections with supervisory control and regulated rewriting, including the relationships between AC systems and supervisory control, and between GC/LGC systems and regulated rewriting. We also discuss some applications of C systems and finally propose some open questions."
"Based on a state-of-the-art review of the Road Network Design Problem (RNDP), this paper proposes a bi-level programming model for the RNDP as well as algorithms for it. In the lower level of the proposed model, the elastic-demand Stochastic User Equilibrium (SUE) model is adopted to coincide well with characteristics of users behavior, and additionally, the parameter calibration method for the model is developed based on the Logit path choice model. In the upper level of the proposed model, the consumer surplus is maximized to improve the social benefit of a network in consideration of the travel demand, the construction cost, the off-gas emissions and the saturation level. The algorithm for the lower-level model is developed based on the descent iteration method, Dijkstra's algorithm and linear search technology. A modified Genetic Algorithm (GA) is developed as the algorithm for the whole bi-level model, which takes designed elitist selection operator, adaptive cross operator, mutation operator and niche technology into consideration. The proposed model and algorithms are applied to a numerical example. The results demonstrate the validity and efficiency of the model and algorithms, which shows a bright prospect of the application in RNDP."
"In this paper, we show that the dynamics of injection-locked Spin Hall Effect Spin-Torque Oscillator ( SHE-STO) cluster can be exploited as a robust primitive computational operator for non-Boolean associative computing. A cluster of SHE-STOs can be locked to a common frequency and phase with an injected ac current signal. DC input to each STO from external stimuli can conditionally unlock some of them. Based on the input dc signal, the degree of synchronization of SHE-STO cluster is detected by CMOS interface circuitry. The degree of synchronization can be used for associative computing/matching. We present a numerical simulation model of SHE-STO devices based on Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation with spin-transfer torque term and Spin Hall Effect. The model is then used to analyze the frequency and phase locking properties of injection-locked SHE-STO cluster. Results show that associative computing based on the injection locked SHE-STO cluster can be energy efficient and relatively immune to device parameter variations and thermal noise."
"The data of experimental studies on the after-fire digression of subtaiga forest-steppe pine forests in the Southwestern Baikal Region are analyzed. Ground fires of the litter-humus type are ascertained to be the most destructive factor in the dynamics of pine forests. The effect of a ground fire is accompanied with the drying of trees, and the vital capacity of those that survived the fire depends on the severity of fire damages. The characteristic of the lower vegetation layers and its dynamics under the effect of moderately intense fires are presented. Ground fires are shown to negatively affect the change in the reserve qualitative fractional structure of organogenic soil layers and their chemical composition."
"Objective: To measure the impact of a reimbursement-based consumer subsidy on vegetable expenditures, consumption and waste. Design: Two-arm randomized controlled trial; two-week baseline observation period, three-week intervention period. Participants' vegetable expenditures, consumption and waste were monitored using receipts collection and through an FFQ. During the intervention period, the treatment group received reimbursement of up to 50 US dollars ($) for purchased vegetables. Setting: Participants were solicited from Palo Alto, CA, USA using materials advertising a 'consumer behavior study' and a small participation incentive. To prevent selection bias, solicitation materials did not describe the specific behaviour being evaluated. Subjects: One hundred and fifty potential participants responded to the solicitations and 144 participants enrolled in the study; 138 participants completed all five weekly surveys. Results: Accounting for the control group (n 69) and the two-week baseline period, the intervention significantly impacted the treatment group's (n 69) vegetable expenditures (+$ 8.16 (SD 2.67)/week, P< 0.01), but not vegetable consumption (+ 1.3 (SD 1.2) servings/week, P= 0.28) or waste (-0.23 (SD 1.2) servings/week, P= 0.60). Conclusions: The consumer subsidy significantly increased participants' vegetable expenditures, but not consumption or waste, suggesting that this type of subsidy might not have the effects anticipated. Reimbursement-based consumer subsidies may therefore not be as useful a policy tool for impacting vegetable consumption as earlier studies have suggested. Moreover, moderation analysis revealed that the subsidy's effect on participants' vegetable expenditures was significant only in men. Additional research should seek to determine how far reaching gender-specific effects are in this context. Further research should also examine the effect of a similar consumer subsidy on high-risk populations and explore to what extent increases in participants' expenditures are due to the purchase of more expensive vegetables, purchasing of vegetables during the study period that were consumed outside the study period, or a shift from restaurant vegetable consumption to grocery vegetable consumption."
"The stability of the ITO/CuPc/C-60/Al cells exposed in air without encapsulation is studied. It is found that the performances of the cells will first enhance a little during the first hour after fabrication, and then begin to decline. The reason can be attributed to the appearance of Al2O3 layer at the interface of C-60/Al. The function and mechanism of this Al2O3 layer are similar to a LiF cathode buffer layer. The verification experiments were established and the optimal encapsulation time for ITO/CuPc/C-60/Al cells was demonstrated. The optimal encapsulation time in this work is an hour after removing from the vacuum. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."
"A new socially-parasitic species, Myrmica latra sp. n. is described based on a queen and male from Indian Himalaya. Its queen differs from other species by the distinctly narrower petiole and postpetiole, blunt and non-divergent propodeal spines, and a darker body colour. The taxonomic position of the three known Himalayan socially-parasitic Myrmica species is discussed, and M. ereptrix Bolton 1988 is transferred to the smythiesii species-group. It is supposed that M. nefaria Bharti 2012 is a temporary social parasite, but M. ereptrix and M. latra sp. n. are permanent social parasites, and a key for their identification is provided."
"We derive field equations of Gauss-Bonnet gravity in four dimensions after dimensional reduction of the action and demonstrate that in this scenario the Vainshtein mechanism operates in the flat spherically symmetric background. We show that inside this Vainshtein sphere the fifth force is negligibly small compared to the gravitational force. We also investigate the stability of the spherically symmetric solution, and clarify the vocabulary used in the literature about the hyperbolicity of the equation and the ghost-Laplacian stability conditions. We find superluminal behavior of the perturbation of the field in the radial direction. However, because of the presence of the nonlinear terms, the structure of the space-time is modified and as a result the field does not propagate in the Minkowski metric but rather in an ""aether"" composed of the scalar field pi(r). We thereby demonstrate that the superluminal behavior does not create time paradoxes thanks to the absence of causal closed curves. We also derive the stability conditions for a Friedmann universe in context with scalar and tensor perturbations and we study the cosmology of the model."
"We present a penalty-based haptic rendering analysis method for medicinal dentistry diagnose simulation. The method is based on the locally optimized generalized penetration computation algorithm which computes the minimum translational and rotational motion to separate two overlapping objects. The essence of penalty-based haptic rendering method is computing an amount of penetration depth, and the output force magnitude is following the Hooke's law. We use the virtual coupling method to calculate the output force and analysis the damping and stiffness coefficient in order to get a rendering force which optimizes the haptic feedback value and resolves the instability problems in haptic rendering system. Furthermore, we introduce friction force on different surface textures of the interacting objects. And successfully mapped the virtual contact results to force feedback and integrated the algorithm into the off-the-shelf 6Dof haptic device. The experiment result shows that our method can generate stable and realistic haptic feedback in dentistry diagnose simulation near ideal update rate."
"Background This systematic review aimed to evaluate the impact of nutrition interventions on participant reported pain severity and intensity in populations with chronic pain. Methods Eight databases were systematically searched for studies that included adult populations with a chronic pain condition, a nutrition intervention and a measure of pain. Where possible, data were pooled using meta-analysis. Seventy-one studies were included, with 23 being eligible for meta-analysis. Results Studies were categorised into four groups: (i) altered overall diet with 12 of 16 studies finding a significant reduction in participant reported pain; (ii) altered specific nutrients with two of five studies reporting a significant reduction in participant reported pain; (iii) supplement-based interventions with 11 of 46 studies showing a significant reduction in pain; and (iv) fasting therapy with one of four studies reporting a significant reduction in pain. The meta-analysis found that, overall, nutrition interventions had a significant effect on pain reduction with studies testing an altered overall diet or just one nutrient having the greatest effect. Conclusions This review highlights the importance and effectiveness of nutrition interventions for people who experience chronic pain."
"Neuropsychiatric systemic lupus erythematosus (NPSLE) presents a diagnostic challenge as there is no unified pathophysiological process driving its presentation. Case reports are limited in detailing manifestations and outcomes of NPSLE. This case highlights a unique presentation of NPSLE and discusses challenges associated with diagnosis. A 27-year-old man with systemic lupus erythematosus presented with altered mentation. Initial laboratory results and computed tomography of the brain were unremarkable, but magnetic resonance imaging of the brain revealed ring-enhancing lesions reported as NCC. This led to an extensive infectious disease evaluation, but ultimately there was no evidence of infection. The patient was diagnosed with NPSLE; treatment with intravenous glucocorticoids and cyclophosphamide led to dramatic clinical improvement. Repeat brain magnetic resonance imaging showed resolution of the ringed lesions. This case illustrates the importance of thorough evaluation in immunocompromised patients and warns of the risk of anchoring bias that can lead to diagnostic delays."
"The aim of this study is to explore the potential of utilizing carbon-doped fullerene-like boron-nitride nanocages (B11N12C and B12N11C) as an efficient metal-free catalyst for the oxidation of SO2 to SO3 molecule in the presence of N2O. The oxidation of SO2 over B11N12C includes two steps. First, the N2O molecule is decomposed into an activated oxygen atom (O*) and N-2 molecule, and then the SO2 molecule is oxidized by the O* species. In the case of B12N11C and B12N12, however, the reaction starts with the coadsorption of SO2 and N2O molecules, followed by the decomposition of N2O and the formation of SO3 and N-2 species. According to our results, B11N12C exhibits larger catalytic activity for the SO2 oxidation compared with B12N11C and B12N12 clusters. The estimated activation energy for the SO2 + O* -> SO3 reaction catalyzed over the B11N12C surface is 5.8 kcal/mol, which is comparable with those reported about noble-metal catalysts. The results of this study can be useful for developing metal-free catalysts based on C-doped BN nanostructures."
"Diabetic nephropathy (DN) is a primary cause of end-stage renal disease and is becoming more prevalent because of the global rise in type 2 diabetes. A model of DN, the db/db uninephrectomized (db/db-uni) mouse, is characterized by obesity, as well as compromised renal function. This model also manifests defects in mineral metabolism common in DN, including hyperphosphatemia, which leads to severe endocrine disease. The FGF23 coreceptor, alpha-Klotho, circulates as a soluble, cleaved form (cKL) and may directly influence phosphate handling. Our study sought to test the effects of cKL on mineral metabolism in db/db-uni mice. Mice were placed into either mild or moderate disease groups on the basis of the albumin-to-creatinine ratio (ACR). Body weights of db/db-uni mice were significantly greater across the study compared with lean controls regardless of disease severity. Adeno-associated cKL administration was associated with increased serum Klotho, intact, bioactive FGF23 (iFGF23), and COOH-terminal fragments of FGF23 (P < 0.05). Blood urea nitrogen was improved after cKL administration, and cKL corrected hyperphosphatemia in the high- and low-ACR db/db-uni groups. Interestingly, 2 wk after cKL delivery, blood glucose levels were significantly reduced in db/db-uni mice with high ACR (P < 0.05). Interestingly, several genes associated with stabilizing active iFGF23 were also increased in the osteoblastic UMR-106 cell line with cKL treatment. In summary, delivery of cKL to a model of DN normalized blood phosphate levels regardless of disease severity, supporting the concept that targeting cKL-affected pathways could provide future therapeutic avenues in DN. NEW & NOTEWORTHY In this work, systemic and continuous delivery of the ""soluble"" or ""cleaved"" form of the FGF23 coreceptor alpha-Klotho (cKL) via adeno-associated virus to a rodent model of diabetic nephropathy (DN), the db/db uninephrectomized mouse, normalized blood phosphate levels regardless of disease severity. This work supports the concept that targeting cKL-affected pathways could provide future therapeutic avenues for the severe mineral metabolism defects associated with DN."
"A cylindrical dielectric resonator antenna with switchable beams is proposed in this letter. The high-order HEM21(1+delta) mode of cylindrical dielectric resonator is excited at 5.8 GHz for high gain and quasi-endfire radiation pattern for the first time. Eight switches, whose locations are carefully optimized, are used to control the beam directions. By turning on one of the eight PIN diodes, the proposed antenna can rotate the beam to the opposite direction of the switch. For each direction, the antenna exhibits high gain (7.27 dBi), high efficiency (86.1%), low cross-polarization level, and similar radiation patterns. With these advantages, the antenna can be widely applied in wireless communication systems, especially for multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) systems."
"Orchestral musicians commonly have playing-related symptoms (PRS) but few use worker's compensation (WC) insurance for assessment and treatment. The purpose of this study was to examine the frequency of, and factors related to, filing a WC claim among musicians. METHODS: An online questionnaire was completed by 261 members of the International Conference of Symphony and Opera Musicians (ICSOM). The responses were analyzed to describe the frequency and type of injuries, perceived cause of PRS, and severity of injury in musicians who did and did not file a WC claim. RESULTS: Of the musicians, 93% reported PRS in the 12 months prior to the study. Only 9 musicians filed WC claims during their careers, and all claims were for upper extremity injuries. The most frequent reason for not filing a WC claim was insufficient severity. Yet among musicians describing their PRS as not severe enough for a WC claim, 47% had symptoms for >15 minutes after playing and 16% had symptoms that interfered with daily activities. CONCLUSION: These data suggest there is frequent under-reporting of injuries to WC among professional orchestral musicians. Although most musicians reported PRS that persisted after playing, the most common reason for not filing a WC claim was insufficient severity of symptoms perceived by the musicians. Future research should focus on clearly defining severity for PRS-related injuries and determining when treatment for overuse syndromes should be paid for through the WC system."
"We perform a time-dependent local spin density approximation (TDLSDA) study of one-dimensional Fermions with a contact interaction. We show that the simple TDLSDA approximation provides an exact description for density and spin density modes and conductance G in one-dimensional quantum wires, by establishing a general equivalence between TDSLDA and Tomonaga-Luttinger model for the elementary excitation spectra in one-dimensional Fermi systems. The role of interaction effects is carefully analyzed especially in relation to the problem of the universality of the result G = 2e(2)/h for the conductance of one-dimensional systems. Finally our results are in good agreement with the available experimental data on the one-dimensional plasmon dispersion, and conductance in GaAs quantum wires."
"The rate of M-L >= 3 earthquakes in the central and eastern United States increased beginning in 2009, particularly in Oklahoma and central Arkansas, where fluid injection has occurred. We find evidence that suggests these rate increases are man-made by examining the rate changes in a catalog of M-L >= 3 earthquakes in Oklahoma, which had a low background seismicity rate before 2009, as well as rate changes in a catalog of M-L >= 2.2 earthquakes in central Arkansas, which had a history of earthquake swarms prior to the start of injection in 2009. In both cases, stochastic epidemic-type aftershock sequence models and statistical tests demonstrate that the earthquake rate change is statistically significant, and both the background rate of independent earthquakes and the aftershock productivity must increase in 2009 to explain the observed increase in seismicity. This suggests that a significant change in the underlying triggering process occurred. Both parameters vary, even when comparing natural to potentially induced swarms in Arkansas, which suggests that changes in both the background rate and the aftershock productivity may provide a way to distinguish man-made from natural earthquake rate changes. In Arkansas we also compare earthquake and injection well locations, finding that earthquakes within 6 km of an active injection well tend to occur closer together than those that occur before, after, or far from active injection. Thus, like a change in productivity, a change in interevent distance distribution may also be an indicator of induced seismicity."
"Context. Whenever stars rotate very rapidly, such that Omega/Omega(crit) > 0.7 where Omega(crit) is the Keplerian angular velocity of the star accounting for its deformation, radiative stellar winds are enhanced in polar regions. This theoretical prediction has now been confirmed by interferometric observations of rapidly rotating stars. Aims. Polar winds remove less angular momentum than spherical winds, thus allow the star to retain more angular momentum. We quantitatively assess the importance of this effect. Methods. We first use a semi-analytical approach to estimate the variation in the angular momentum loss when the rotation parameter increases. We then compute complete 9 M-circle dot stellar models at very high angular velocities (starting on the ZAMS with Omega/Omega(crit) = 0.8 and reaching the critical velocity during the main sequence) with and without radiative wind anisotropies. Results. When wind anisotropies are accounted for, the angular-momentum loss rate is reduced by less than 4% for Omega/Omega(crit) < 0.9 relative to the case for spherical winds. The reduction amounts to at most 30% when the star is rotating near the critical velocity. These values result from two counteracting effects: on the one hand, polar winds reduce the loss of angular momentum, and on the other hand, surface deformations imply that the mass that is lost at high co-latitude is lost at a larger distance from the rotational axis and thus removes more angular momentum. Conclusions. In contrast to previous studies that neglected surface deformations, we show that the radiative wind anisotropies have a relatively modest effect on the evolution of the angular momentum content of rapidly rotating stars."
"Multiple energy generating cycles such as tri-generation cycles, which produce heat and cold in addition to power through burning of a primary fuel, have increasingly been used in recent decades. On the other hand, advanced exergy analysis of thermodynamic systems by splitting exergy destruction into endogenous and exogenous parts identifies internal irreversibilities of each of the components and the effect of these irreversibilities on the performance of other components. Therefore, main sources of exergy destruction in cycles can be highlighted and useful recommendations in order to improve the performance of thermodynamic cycles can be presented. In the present work, a tri-generation cycle with 100 MW power production, 70 MW heat and 9 MW cooling capacity is considered. For this tri-generation cycle, effects of various thermodynamic parameters on the amount of endogenous and exogenous exergy destructions, exergy loss and the amount of fuel consumption, are investigated. The results indicate that, increasing compressor pressure ratio, pre-heater outlet temperature and excess air leads to better combustion and lower exergy loss and fuel consumption. Increasing the mass flow rate of steam generator, while keeping the cycle outlet temperature constant and considering cooling capacity variable, lead to increase the first- and second-law efficiencies of the cycle.

"Drawing on a combination of interviews and archive materials, mainly from the trade press, this article describes the emergence of restaurant pastry chefs in France as a case of professional segmentation. Following the spread of a new category of sweet preparations (plated desserts) in the 1980s, dessert production in restaurants - that is to say the content, organization and aesthetic conventions of the activity - is described from a new perspective, contrasted with the work of cooks and pastry shop workers. Since the 1990s, in response to this evolution in restaurant desserts, specialist associations have formed to claim a jurisdiction for ""restaurant pastry chefs"" (patissiers de restaurant), advancing a new definition of pastry work. Since the late 1990s, these claims have been echoed by the descriptions of pastry work proposed by the French federation of pastry shop owners. In the description of this case, the paper argues that professional segmentation should not be defined as the incorporation of several segments within a third form, but as the emergence of mutual dependency between several professional forms, such as between restaurant pastry chefs and pastry shops owners."
"Interprofessional learning (IPL) aims to equip students for future interprofessional and collaborative practice. Involving students as IPL facilitators is becoming increasingly commonplace as an attempt to catalyse the necessary transformation of our workforce needed to deliver truly integrated and person-centred care. Evidence in the literature highlights the key role of trained facilitators in reaching successful IPL outcomes. Some guidelines are available as to how we train staff facilitators, but little evidence is available that describes how to appropriately prepare student IPL facilitators. The aim of this exploratory study was to investigate whether student IPL facilitators felt that they were sufficiently prepared for their role. Data in the form of open-ended text-based responses from student facilitators (n = 9) were collated after an intervention where student facilitators had been given the role of supporting IPL. Data were analysed using principles of thematic analysis. Three main themes emerged: i) building confidence; ii) purpose of IPL; iii) learning moments. Student IPL facilitators who took part in this study felt that they were adequately prepared for their role. Findings show that preparing students for IPL facilitation has similar, yet unique, components compared to the training staff. In particular, this study highlighted a need for student facilitators to receive further preparation to help build their confidence. Involving students as IPL facilitators has great potential in staff and students joining forces to equip students for future interprofessional and collaborative practice that can deliver high-quality care."
"Background: The cardio-metabolic and antioxidant health benefits of caffeinated green tea (GT) relate to its catechin polyphenol content. Less is known about decaffeinated extracts, particularly in combination with exercise. The aim of this study was therefore to determine whether a decaffeinated green tea extract (dGTE) positively influenced fat oxidation, body composition and exercise performance in recreationally active participants. Methods: Fourteen, recreationally active males participated in a double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel design intervention (mean +/- SE; age = 21.4 +/- 0.3 yrs; weight = 76.37 +/- 1.73 kg; body fat = 16.84 +/- 0.97%, peak oxygen consumption [(V) over dotO(2peak)] = 3.00 +/- 0.10 L.min(-1)). Participants were randomly assigned capsulated dGTE (571 mg.d(-1); n = 7) or placebo (PL; n = 7) for 4 weeks. Following body composition and resting cardiovascular measures, participants cycled for 1 hour at 50% (V) over dotO(2peak), followed by a 40 minute performance trial at week 0, 2 and 4. Fat and carbohydrate oxidation was assessed via indirect calorimetry. Pre-post exercise blood samples were collected for determination of total fatty acids (TFA). Distance covered (km) and average power output (W) were assessed as exercise performance criteria. Results: Total fat oxidation rates increased by 24.9% from 0.241 +/- 0.025 to 0.301 +/- 0.009 g.min(-1) with dGTE (P = 0.05; eta p(2) = 0.45) by week 4, whereas substrate utilisation was unaltered with PL. Body fat significantly decreased with dGTE by 1.63 +/- 0.16% in contrast to PL over the intervention period (P < 0.001; eta p(2) = 0.84). No significant changes for FFA or blood pressure between groups were observed. dGTE resulted in a 10.9% improvement in performance distance covered from 20.23 +/- 0.54 km to 22.43 +/- 0.40 km by week 4 (P < 0.001; eta p(2) = 0.85). Conclusions: A 4 week dGTE intervention favourably enhanced substrate utilisation and subsequent performance indices, but did not alter TFA concentrations in comparison to PL. The results support the use of catechin polyphenols from dGTE in combination with exercise training in recreationally active volunteers."
"We have performed a survey for new members of the Upper Sco association that have circumstellar disks using mid-infrared photometry from the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE). Through optical and near-infrared spectroscopy, we have confirmed 185 candidates as likely members of Upper Sco with spectral types ranging from mid-K to M9. They comprise similar to 36% of the known disk-bearing members of the association. We also have compiled all available mid-infrared photometry from WISE and the Spitzer Space Telescope for the known members of Upper Sco, resulting in a catalog of data for 1608 objects. We have used these data to identify the members that exhibit excess emission from disks and we have classified the evolutionary stages of those disks with criteria similar to those applied in our previous studies of Taurus and Upper Sco. Among 484 members with excesses in at least one band (excluding five Be stars), we classify 296 disks as full, 66 as evolved, 19 as transitional, 22 as evolved or transitional, and 81 as evolved transitional or debris. Many of these disks have not been previously reported, including 129 full disks and 50 disks that are at more advanced evolutionary stages."
"Much medical literature attributes persistently high rates of very low birthweight (VLBW) to ""dysregulated"" gestation. We offer the alternative view that natural selection conserved well-regulated, though nonconscious, decisional biology that protects the reproductive fitness of women by spontaneously aborting gestations that would otherwise yield frail infants, particularly small males. Modern obstetric practice, however, converts some fraction of these erstwhile spontaneous abortions into live births of very small infants. We further propose that the nonconscious decisional biology of gestation exhibits preferences also seen in consciously made decisions. We hypothesize that the incidence of VLBW among male infants should vary with the population's self-reported intentions to assume financial risk. We apply time-series modeling to monthly birth counts by sex and weight from the Swedish Medical Birth Registry between January 1993 and December 2010. We gauge risk aversion with monthly data from the Micro Index of the Swedish Consumer Tendency Survey (MISCT). Consistent with our argument that nonconscious decisional biology shares risk aversion with conscious decisions, we find that the incidence of VLBW among male infants in Sweden varies with the population's self-reported intentions to assume financial risk. We find increases above expected odds of a very low weight infant among males born 1 month after increases above expected levels of self-reported risk aversion in the Swedish population. We offer this finding as support for the argument that persistently high rates of VLBW arise, at least in part, from a combination of medical interventions and mechanisms conserved by natural selection to protect reproductive fitness.

"Thymomas are rare tumors of the thymic epithelium with a broad spectrum of morphological and clinical features. Despite a benign histological appearance, it can invade nearby structures or metastasize. The majority of patients are asymptomatic, but some may present with paraneoplastic syndromes such as myasthenia gravis, red cell aplasia, or hypogammaglobulinemia. Various staging systems of thymomas have been defined based on the degree of invasiveness. According to the WHO Classification, there are six histologic types of thymic epithelial tumors. The most important prognostic factor is the stage according to Masaoka's system. We report a case of invasive thymoma diagnosed incidentally in a patient with cardiovascular risk factors referred to the cardiologist with suspected thoracic aorta aneurism."
"This study examines the economic impact of the expenditures from the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) of 2009 that the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) administered for coastal habitat restoration projects around the United States. Estimates of the total jobs created as well as the average number of jobs created per million dollars spent are provided. The study shows that the 50 ARRA projects administered by NOAA in the first year and half generated a total of 1409 jobs. These habitat restoration projects created, on average, 17 jobs per million dollars spent which is similar to other conservation industries such as parks and land conservation, and much higher than other traditional industries including coal, gas, and nuclear energy generation. This suggests that habitat restoration is indeed an effective way to stimulate job creation. In addition, habitat restoration has longer-term economic benefits, including future job creation in rebuilt fisheries and coastal tourism, and benefits to coastal economies including higher property values and better water quality. Therefore, investing in blue infrastructure habitat restoration is a green opportunity benefiting coastal economies and societies in both the short and the long term. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

"The study examined, using confirmatory factor analyses, the three-factor structure of the Disposition to Seek Forgiveness Questionnaire - inability in seeking forgiveness, sensitivity to circumstances before seeking forgiveness, and unconditional seeking of forgiveness - among samples from Latin America (Brazil), Africa (Angola and Mozambique), Asia (Indonesia), and Southern Europe (Portugal). It was found that this ternary structure has cross-cultural generality."
"We report four cases of communicating hydrocephalus, requiring shunt placement, in the subset of patients whose ventricles were breached at the time of glioma resection (a total 97 cases over 3 years). The hydrocephalus in these cases presented without ventricular dilatation on computed tomography (CT) scanning, and in 3 cases without headache. Failure to progress, visual deterioration or cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leak in the post-operative patient after tumour resection with ventricular opening should alert clinicians to the possibility of hydrocephalus, despite the absence of headache or ventriculomegaly, and lumbar puncture should be performed without delay."
"An impact of a magnetic cloud on the Earth's magnetosphere occurred at 1636 UT on 25 June, 1998, associated with a sudden increase of the solar wind density and velocity, as well as a sudden increase of the zenithal component of the interplanetary magnetic field (IMF-B-z). Following the impact of the magnetic cloud, IMF-B-z was northward (10 nT) and remained steadily strong (about 15 nT) for the next six hours. IMF-B-z turned southward at 2330 UT on 25 June, 1998, and remained strongly southward (-15 nT) for the next four hours. During the positive phase of IMF-B-z, both the Auroral index and ring current index SYM/H remained steadily low indicating complete isolation of the Earth's magnetosphere from the solar wind and no significant changes were observed in the equatorial ionosphere. After the southward turning, the steady southward IMF-B-z permitted solar wind energy to penetrate the magnetosphere and caused the generation of a magnetic storm associated with strong auroral electrojet activity (A(E) index). Strong southward IMF-B-z corresponds to the dawn-dusk interplanetary electric field (eastward on the dayside and westward on the night side). The ionograms at Jicamarca (night side) showed strong spread-F and at Thumba (dayside) showed an absence of equatorial type of sporadic-E, indicating a dusk-to-dawn electric field. Thus, the observations point to an electric field opposite in direction to that expected by the prompt penetration of the interplanetary electric field. An abnormally-large Auroral index (A(E)) associated with the start of the storm suggests that the cause of the equatorial electric field changes is due to the disturbance dynamo effect."
"Background. Vitamin E (VE) bonded polysulfone dialysis membranes have putative erythropoiesis stimulating agent (ESA)-sparing and anti-inflammatory properties based on data from a small number of studies. We sought to investigate this in a large, prospective 12-month randomized controlled trial. Methods. Two-hundred and sixty prevalent haemodialysis (HD) patients were randomized to dialysis with VE-bonded polysulfone membranes or non-VE-bonded equivalents. All ESA-dosing was performed by means of a computer-based anaemia management decision support system. Monthly data were used to calculate the ESA resistance index (ERI) and blood tests were performed at baseline, 6 and 12 months for measurement of C-reactive protein (CRP) levels. Results. Of the 260 patients, 123 were randomized to dialysis with the VE-membrane and 12-month data was available for 220 patients. At the study population level, no beneficial effect of the VE membranes on the ERI or CRP levels was observed. Post hoc analyses indicated that there was a significant fall in ERI for patients with the highest baseline ESA resistance dialysed with the VE (9.28 [7.70-12.5] versus 7.70 [5.34-12.7] IU/week/kg/g/dL Hb, P = 0.01) but not the control membranes (9.45 [7.62-12.3] versus 8.14 [4.44-15.6] IU/week/kg/g/dL Hb, P = 0.41); this was not attributable to changes in CRP levels. Conclusions. Wholesale switching of all chronic HD patients to dialysis with VE-bonded polysulfone membranes appears not to be associated with improvements in ESA-responsiveness or CRP. These membranes may have utility in patients with heightened ESA resistance."
"Modular multilevel converter (MMC) is now the state-of-the-art converter topology for high-voltage dc transmission (HVDC) systems. Another potential application for MMC is medium-voltage (MV) high-power industrial ac drives. In high-power applications, thermal constraints of power semiconductor devices limit device switching frequency to a few hundred hertz. However, there exists a tradeoff between device switching frequency and harmonic distortion of converter output currents. Synchronous optimal pulsewidth (SOP) modulation is an emerging low-device switching-frequency-modulation technique for high-power converters, which maintains the quality of converter output currents. SOP technique has been successfully demonstrated for classical multilevel topologies and it has been proved that maximum-device switching frequency can be limited to rated fundamental frequency for seven or higher level inverters without compromising on the quality of output currents. However, implementation of SOP technique for MMC topology is still pending. One of the main challenges for control of MMC is to maintain floating-capacitor voltages around their nominal value. The goal of our study is to propose, analyze, and implement enhanced SOP technique for MMCs to achieve low-device switching-frequency operation, better quality of converter output currents, and maintain capacitor voltages around their nominal value. The proposed technique has been validated using low-power prototype of five-level MMC feeding an 1.5-kW induction motor."
"The combined effects of erosive rains, steep slopes and human land use have caused severe land degradation in the Ethiopian Highlands for several thousand years, but since the 1970s, however, land rehabilitation programmes have been established to try to reverse deterioration. In order to characterize and quantify the transformations in the north Ethiopian Highlands, a study was carried out over 8884 km(2) of the Tigray Highlands of northern Ethiopia. Using Landsat Multispectral Scanner and later Thematic Mapper imagery (1972, 1984/1986 and 2000), historical terrestrial photographs (1974-1975) and fieldwork (2008), we prepared land use and cover maps. For assessing the use of the historical terrestrial photographs, Landsat images from 1972 were classified using two different methods, namely conventional change detection (image differencing) and ground truthing (using the historical photographs of 1974-1975). Results show that the use of terrestrial photographs is promising, as the classification accuracy based on this method (Kappa coefficient 0.54) is better than the classification accuracy of the method based on image differencing (Kappa coefficient 0.46). Major land use and cover changes indicate the following: (1) a gradual but significant decline in bare ground (32 per cent in 1972 to 8 per cent in 2000); (2) a significant increase of bushland (25 to 43 per cent) and total forest area (including eucalypt plantations, 2.6 to 6.3 per cent); and (3) creation of numerous lakes and ponds. The dominant change trajectory (27 per cent of the study area) indicates a gradual or recent vegetation increase. These changes can be linked to the population growth and the introduction of land rehabilitation initiatives, complemented by growing awareness of land holders.

"Antioxidant activity of ethanol and water extracts and infusion of the flowers of Phrygilanthus acutifolius were evaluated. Total phenolic contents were determined using Folin- Ciocalteau reagent. The ethanol extract was more effective in scavenging radical 1,1 biphenyl -2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH), with lower IC50 values. The water and ethanol extracts were the most effective antioxidants based on the inhibition of lipid peroxidation (beta carotene bleaching method). The acute toxicity test in rats indicated that oral administration of 3.200 mg/Kg of flowers produced neither mortality, nor changes in behaviour or any other physiological activities. There were no significant differences in the body and organ weight between controls and treated animals. In blood chemistry analysis, aspartate transaminase, alanine transaminase, and alkaline phosphatase activities, no significant changes occurred. In view of the doses consumed empirically in traditional medicine of Amaicha del Valle, Tucuman, Argentina, there is a wide margin of safety for the therapeutic use of Phrygilanthus acutifolius flowers."
"Posttransplant lymphoproliferative disorder (PTLD) is a potentially fatal disease that arises in 2%-10% of solid organ and hematopoietic stem cell transplants and is most frequently of B-cell origin. This very heterogeneous disorder ranges from benign lymphoproliferations to malignant lymphomas, and despite the clear association with Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV) infection, its etiology is still obscure. Although a number of risk factors have been identified (EBV serostatus, graft type, and immunosuppressive regimen), it is currently not possible to predict which transplant patient will eventually develop PTLD. Genetic studies have linked translocations (involving C-MYC, IGH, BCL-2), various copy number variations, DNA mutations (PIM1, PAX5, C-MYC, RhoH/TTF), and polymorphisms in both the host (IFN-gamma, IL-10, TGF-beta, HLA) and the EBV genome to B-cell PTLD development. Furthermore, the tumor microenvironment seems to play an important role in the course of disease representing a local niche that can allow antitumor immune responses even in an immunocompromised host. Taken together, B-cell PTLD pathogenesis is very complex due to the interplay of many different (patient-dependent) factors and requires thorough molecular analysis for the development of novel tailored therapies. This review aims at giving a global overview of the currently known parameters that contribute to the development of B-cell PTLD."
"This study aimed to evaluate the reproduction of Pratylenchus zeae and P. brachyurus in leguminous plants used as cover crops. Seedlings of sunn hemp (Crotalaria juncea and C. spectabilis), pigeon pea cultivar IPR 43 (Cajanus cajan), dwarf velvet bean (Mucuna deeringiana), black velvet bean (Stizolobium aterrimum), and jack bean (Canavalia ensiformis) were inoculated with each nematode separately. Maize cultivar IPR 114 and soybean cultivar Pintado were used as controls to measure the viability of the inoculation of P. zeae and P. brachyurus. After 90 days of inoculation, the plants were collected and nematode g(-)(1) root, final population, and reproduction factors (RF) were evaluated. The experiment was carried out at two different times of the year. The nematode's RF on cover crops from treatments with the two Crotalaria species, dwarf pigeon pea, and black velvet bean were lower than one (bad host plants) in both experiments for P. zeae. For P. brachyurus, the lowest RFs were obtained for C. juncea, C. spectabilis, and pigeon pea, while the other plants presented RF values close to or higher than one in at least one of the experiments. Therefore, C. spectabilis, C. juncea, and C. cajan cultivar IPR 43 are antagonistic plants that represent useful options for rotation or succession systems that aim to control P. zeae and P. brachyurus."
"Several studies have evidenced high prevalence of myocardial systolic and diastolic dysfunction among patients with systemic sclerosis (SSc). Exercise echocardiography has shown a diagnostic and prognostic role in identifying early left ventricular (LV) dysfunction in several myocardial pathological settings. The aim of our study was to evaluate early signs of LV impairment under exercise and their correlation to patient's exercise tolerance. Forty-five patients (age 60.4 +/- A 10.3 years) with SSc and 20 age and sex comparable controls were enrolled in the study. All patients underwent clinical evaluation, 2D echocardiography associated with Tissue Doppler and speckle tracking to evaluate LV deformation indexes, and an exercise echocardiography to evaluate left ventricle contractile reserve (LVCR) and exercise pulmonary pressures. Finally, a 6-minute walking test (6MWT) to evaluate exercise tolerance was also performed. Compared to controls, SSc patients showed an impaired diastolic function (E/E' 10.9 +/- A 3.7 vs 8.36 +/- A 2.01; p < 0.01) associated with larger left atrial dimensions (LAVI 28.4 +/- A 8.7 vs 19.3 +/- A 4.6 mL/m(2); p < 0.01). During exercise echocardiography, a reduced global longitudinal strain at peak exercise (S-GLS) was highlighted compared to controls (15.7 +/- A 3.6 vs 18.2 +/- A 2.2; p = 0.001). A S-GLS cutoff < 18 %, identified by ROC analysis, identified SSc patients with a reduced diastolic function, exercise tolerance at the 6MWT and higher pulmonary pressures. Our data show that in SSc patients a reduced LVCR characterizes the patients with a more extensive cardiovascular impairment in terms of LV diastolic function, pulmonary pressures and exercise tolerance. These data underline the importance of exercise echocardiography for the preclinical screening of the LV impairment in this population."
"The time-variable electromagnetic sky has been well-explored at a wide range of wavelengths. In contrast, the ultra-violet (UV) variable sky is relatively poorly explored, even though it offers exciting scientific prospects. Here, we review the potential scientific impact of a wide-field UV survey on the study of explosive and other transient events, as well as known classes of variable objects, such as active galactic nuclei and variable stars. We quantify our predictions using a fiducial set of observational parameters which are similar to those envisaged for the proposed ULTRASAT mission. We show that such a mission would be able to revolutionize our knowledge about massive star explosions by measuring the early UV emission from hundreds of events, revealing key physical parameters of the exploding progenitor stars. Such a mission would also detect the UV emission from many tens of tidal-disruption events of stars by supermassive black holes at galactic nuclei and enable a measurement of the rate of such events. The overlap of such a wide-field UV mission with existing and planned gravitational-wave and high-energy neutrino telescopes makes it especially timely."
"The December 2011 5th International Workshop on HIV Persistence during Therapy addressed the issue of HIV persistence among 210 scientists from 10 countries involved in the study of HIV reservoirs and the search of an HIV cure. High quality abstracts were selected and discussed as oral or poster presentations. The aim of this review is to distribute the scientific highlights of this workshop outside the group as analyzed and represented by experts in retrovirology, immunology and clinical research."
"Background: Until the early 2000s, people who inject drugs (PWID) in Quebec had mainly been injecting powder cocaine and heroin. Since then, ethnographic studies have shown that the drug market has diversified, with crack and prescription opioids (PO) becoming increasingly available. This could have led to changes in drug use practices among PWID. The objectives of our study were to examine annual trends in injection of different drugs, crack smoking and frequent injection (FL), as well as relationships between injected drugs and FL. Methods: PWID are participants in the ongoing Quebec SurvUDI surveillance system. PWID (past 6 months) were recruited in 2 urban and 6 semi-urban/rural sites. Each visit included a structured interview addressing drug use behaviours. Analyses were carried out using GEE methods. For trend analyses (2003-2014) on drugs and FI (number of injections >= upper quartile, previous month), the first annual interview was selected for PWID with multiple participations per year. Analyses on associations between Fl and types of injected drugs were based on all interviews (2004-2014). Results: Crack/cocaine and heroin injection declined significantly, with prevalence ratios (PR) per year of 0.983 [95% confidence interval (CI): 0.980-0.986] and 0.979 (95% CI: 0.969-0.990), while PO injection [PR = 1.052 (1.045-1.059)], crack smoking [PR = 1.006 (1.001-1.012)], and Fl (>= 120 injections, previous month) significantly increased [PR = 1.015 (1.004-1.026)]. Compared to PWID who injected crack/cocaine other drugs, the proportion of PWID reporting FI was higher among those who injected PO + heroin/speedball, crack/cocaine or other drugs (adjusted PR 2.29; 95% CI: 2.07-2.53) or PO only (aPR 1.72; 95%Cl: 1.47-2.01). Conclusions: Changes that have occurred in the drug market are reflected in PWID's practices. The high frequency of injection observed among PO injectors is of particular concern. Drug market variations are a challenge for health authorities responsible for harm reduction programs. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."
"Stormwater harvesting is becoming a popular alternative water resource in water stressed regions. Stormwater biofilters have been recognized as being among the most promising pre-treatment technologies. In this study, a series of challenge tests were conducted as part of a validation framework of stormwater biofilters for selected micropollutants. Two biofilter configurations were studied: a configuration with loamy sand and no submerged zone (LS-noSZ) and another configuration that uses sand and a submerged zone (S-SZ). Biofilter challenge conditions were: (i) treatment volume set at 95th percentile of all treated events and (ii) the maximum and minimum durations of dry period between two events, both based on hydrology simulations using 30 years rainfall data for Melbourne. The hydraulic performance of S-SZ was stable and not affected by either prolonged wet or dry periods, while the outflow rate of LS-noSZ was largely reduced during prolonged wet periods. Biofilters had a removal efficiency of >80% for total petroleum hydrocarbons (TPHs), glyphosate, dibutyl phthalate (DBP), bis-(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP), pyrene and naphthalene loads by both configurations under the most challenge conditions; the removal of pentachlorophenol (PCP) and phenol loads was >80% in LS-noSZ and 50-80% in S-SZ, while chloroform had load removal rates between 20% and 50%. Biofilters were less effective in removing atrazine and simazine with load removal 20-50% in LS-noSZ and <20% in S-SZ. Prolonged dry periods benefited the removal of micropollutants while very short dry periods adversely affected micropollutants removal. The study contributes to the development of the overall framework for validation of stormwater biofilters, which is required if these systems are to be applied in stormwater treatment systems for higher end water uses such as drinking water.

"Critical micelle concentration (CMC) of two anionic surfactants in methanol was estimated using conductometry, viscometry and pyrene fluorescence spectroscopy methods. The surfactants used, were sodium bis(2-ethylhexyl) sulfosuccinate (Aerosol-OT, AOT) and sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) dispersed in pure methanol. The CMC determination was evaluated in room temperature. The results have shown nearly similar concentrations. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."
"Volcanic ash layers preserved within the geologic record represent precise time markers that correlate disparate depositional environments and enable the investigation of synchronous and/or asynchronous behaviors in Earth system and archaeological sciences. However, it is generally assumed that only exceptionally powerful events, such as supereruptions (>= 450 km(3) of ejecta as dense-rock equivalent; recurrence interval of similar to 10(5) yr), distribute ash broadly enough to have an impact on human society, or allow us to address geologic, climatic, and cultural questions on an intercontinental scale. Here we use geochemical, age, and morphological evidence to show that the Alaskan White River Ash (eastern lobe; A.D. 833-850) correlates to the ""AD860B"" ash (A.D. 846-848) found in Greenland and northern Europe. These occurrences represent the distribution of an ash over 7000 km, linking marine, terrestrial, and ice-core records. Our results indicate that tephra from more moderate-size eruptions, with recurrence intervals of similar to 100 yr, can have substantially greater distributions than previously thought, with direct implications for volcanic dispersal studies, correlation of widely distributed proxy records, and volcanic hazard assessment."
"Cracking is caused by physiological stress during the development of jujube fruit, and this causes considerable economic losses to fruit producers. The aim of this study was to clarify the mechanisms of water entry into the fruit and the events that lead to cracking. Differences in water absorption by fruit stalks and surfaces were observed in a cracking-sensitive variety (Ziziphus jujuba Mill. 'Hupingzao') and a cracking-resistant variety (Ziziphus jujuba Mill. 'Yuanlingzao'). The response of the fruit surface to water absorption was studied, and the relationship between stomatal characteristics and cracking was analyzed. The cracking rate of 'Hupingzao' was higher during the coloring period. The relative amount of water absorbed through the fruit stalk of 'Yuanlingzao' after 10 h was 1.22 times higher than that of 'Hupingzao' during the coloring period. The rate of water absorption through the fruit surface of 'Hupingzao' was higher than that of 'Yuanlingzao' during the coloring period (3.73 and 3.04, respectively). Water was transported by the vascular bundle after entering the fruit through the fruit stalk, but was mainly distributed around the stomata of the epidermis and near-surface cells following entry through the fruit surface. After water was absorbed by the fruit surface, surface and stomatal cracks in 'Hupingzao' were apparent, and the degree of cracking of the stomata worsened with increasing water absorption time. The surface of 'Yuanlingzao' appeared cracked with increasing immersion time, but stomatal changes were not obvious. The stomatal size and aperture in the cracking-resistant variety of jujube fruit were lower than those in the cracking-sensitive variety. Stomatal size was positively correlated with the rate of fruit cracking. Water absorption through the surface was the main factor that induced fruit cracking. Stomatal characteristics, as well as the increased and deepened fruit surface microcracks caused by stomatal water absorption, were the primary factors related to cracking."
"Background/Aims: Evidence of increased risk of osteoporosis and osteopenia in chronic liver disease and cirrhosis is inconsistent. This study aims to investigate this relationship and to identify the predictors of increased loss of bone mineral density in Saudi patients. Patients and Methods: One hundred and sixty-four patients and controls who are age and gender matched, were included in this study with 1:1 ratio. Patients' included in this study were adults with confirmed liver cirrhosis. Bone mineral densitometry (BMD) at both lumbar spine (LS) and femoral neck (FN) were collected for both groups. Univariate and multivariate regression analyses were performed to identify predictors of BMD loss. Results: Results showed that cirrhotic patients are at higher risk of developing osteoporosis or osteopenia at LS (OR 2.23, 95% CI [1.19-4.19], P = 0.01) but not at FN, when compared to control sample. Patients with cirrhosis were found to have lower vitamin D and PTH levels (P = 0.0005) and (P = 0.006), respectively. Of the possible predictors tested (gender, age, body mass index [BMI], phosphorus, calcium, parathyroid hormone (PTH), vitamin D, and Model for End Stage Liver Disease [MELD] score), female gender was the main predictor of loss of BMD at LS only (OR 4.80, 95% CI [1.47-15.73], P = 0.01). Conclusions: The study showed that cirrhotic patients are at increased susceptibility of having decreased BMD, particularly at the LS and it highlights the need for preventive measures, especially for female patients."
"The prevalence of stunting among children below 5 years of age is higher in the slum-dwelling population of Bangladesh compared to that in both urban and rural areas. Studies have reported that several factors such as inadequate nutrition, low socio-economic status, poor hygiene and sanitation and lack of maternal education are the substantial predictors of childhood stunting. Almost all these factors are universally present in the slum-dwelling population of Bangladesh. However, few studies have prospectively examined such determinants of stunting among slum populations. In this paper, we reveal the findings of a cohort study with an aim to explore the status of micronutrient adequacy among such vulnerable children and establish its association with stunting along with other determinants. Two-hundredsixty- five children were enrolled and followed since birth until 24 months of age. We collected anthropometric, morbidity and dietary intake data monthly. We used the 24-hour multiple-pass recall approach to collect dietary intake data from the age of 9 months onward. Micronutrient adequacy of the diet was determined by the mean adequacy ratio (MAR) which was constructed from the average intake of 9 vitamins and 4 minerals considered for the analysis. We used generalized estimating equation (GEE) regression models to establish the determinants of stunting between 12-24 months of age in our study population. The prevalence of low-birth-weight (LBW) was about 28.7% and approximately half of the children were stunted by the age of 24 months. The average micronutrient intake was considerably lower than the recommended dietary allowance and the MAR was only 0.48 at 24 months of age compared to the optimum value of 1. However, the MAR was not associated with stunting between 12-24 months of age. Rather, LBW was the significant determinant (AOR = 3.03, 95% CI: 1.69-5.44) after adjusting for other factors such as age (AOR = 2.12, 95% CI: 1.45-3.11 at 24 months and AOR = 1.97, 95% CI: 1.49-2.59 at 18 months, ref: 12 months) and sex (AOR = 1.98, 95% CI: 1.17-3.33, ref: female). Improving the nutritional quality of complementary food in terms of adequacy of micronutrients is imperative for optimum growth but may not be adequate to mitigate under-nutrition in this setting. Further research should focus on identifying multiple strategies that can work synergistically to diminish the burden of stunting in resource-poor settings."
"A multisensor system combined with multivariate analysis is applied for the characterization and classification of white grape juices. The proposed system, known as hybrid electronic tongue, consists of an array of electrochemical microsensors and a colorimetric optofluidic system. A total of 25 white grape juices representing the large variability of vines grown in the Northwest Iberian Peninsula were studied. The data obtained were treated with Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Soft Independent Modeling Class Analogy (SIMCA). The first tool was used to train the system with the reference genotypes Albarino, Muscat a Petit Grains Blanc and Palomino and the second to study the feasibility of the hybrid electronic tongue to distinguish between different grape juice varieties. The results show that the three reference genotypes are well differentiated in the PCA model and this can be used to interpolate the rest of varieties and predict their basic characteristics. Besides, using the SIMCA, the system demonstrates high potential for classifying and discriminating grape varieties."
"Background: ALS2/alsin is a guanine nucleotide exchange factor for the small GTPase Rab5 and involved in macropinocytosis-associated endosome fusion and trafficking, and neurite outgrowth. ALS2 deficiency accounts for a number of juvenile recessive motor neuron diseases (MNDs). Recently, it has been shown that ALS2 plays a role in neuroprotection against MND-associated pathological insults, such as toxicity induced by mutant Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase (SOD1). However, molecular mechanisms underlying the relationship between ALS2-associated cellular function and its neuroprotective role remain unclear. Methodology/Principal Findings: To address this issue, we investigated the molecular and pathological basis for the phenotypic modification of mutant SOD1-expressing mice by ALS2 loss. Genetic ablation of Als2 in SOD1(H46R), but not SOD1(G93A), transgenic mice aggravated the mutant SOD1-associated disease symptoms such as body weight loss and motor dysfunction, leading to the earlier death. Light and electron microscopic examinations revealed the presence of degenerating and/or swollen spinal axons accumulating granular aggregates and autophagosome-like vesicles in early-and even pre-symptomatic SOD1(H46R) mice. Further, enhanced accumulation of insoluble high molecular weight SOD1, poly-ubiquitinated proteins, and macroautophagy-associated proteins such as polyubiquitin-binding protein p62/SQSTM1 and a lipidated form of light chain 3 (LC3-II), emerged in ALS2-deficient SOD1(H46R) mice. Intriguingly, ALS2 was colocalized with LC3 and p62, and partly with SOD1 on autophagosome/endosome hybrid compartments, and loss of ALS2 significantly lowered the lysosome-dependent clearance of LC3 and p62 in cultured cells. Conclusions/Significance: Based on these observations, although molecular basis for the distinctive susceptibilities to ALS2 loss in different mutant SOD1-expressing ALS models is still elusive, disturbance of the endolysosomal system by ALS2 loss may exacerbate the SOD1(H46R)-mediated neurotoxicity by accelerating the accumulation of immature vesicles and misfolded proteins in the spinal cord. We propose that ALS2 is implicated in endolysosomal trafficking through the fusion between endosomes and autophagosomes, thereby regulating endolysosomal protein degradation in vivo."
"Phytoremediation, the use of plants and microbes to cleanup inorganic and organic pollutants, has shown great promise as an inexpensive and feasible form of remediation. More recently, studies have shown that some plants have an amazing capacity to volatilize contaminants and can be an effective remediation strategy if the chemicals released are non-toxic. Arsenic contamination and remediation has drawn great attention in the scientific community. However, its toxicity also varies depending on its form. We evaluated, optimized, and then utilized a solid phase microfiber extraction (SPME) head space sampling technique to characterize the organoarsinical emissions from rabbitfoot grass (Polypogon monspeliensis) in arsenic treated soils to determine if the potentially more toxic organic forms of arsenic (AsH3, AsH2CH3, AsH(CH3)(2), and As(CH3)(3)) were being emitted from the plant soil system. The SPME fiber that proved best fitted for this application was the DVB/CAR/PDMS fiber with a 45 min sampling period. We did detect and confirm the emissions of dimethylchloroarsine (AsCl(CH3)(2)) and pentamethylarsine (As(CH3)(5)). However, it was determined that the more toxic organic forms of arsenic were not released during phytovolatilization. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."
"We consider the general (composite) Newton-Cotes method for the computation of Cauchy principal value integrals and focus on its pointwise superconvergence phenomenon, which means that the rate of convergence of the Newton-Cotes quadrature rule is higher than what is globally possible when the singular point coincides with some a priori known point. The necessary and sufficient conditions satisfied by the superconvergence point are given. Moreover, the superconvergence estimate is obtained and the properties of the superconvergence points are investigated. Finally, some numerical examples are provided to validate the theoretical results. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."
"Background: Cardiovascular diseases and skeletal muscle dysfunction are common comorbidities in COPD. Hand grip strength (HGS) is related to general muscle strength and is associated with cardiovascular disease and all-cause mortality, while the results from small selected COPD populations are contradictory. The aim of this population-based study was to compare HGS among the subjects with and without COPD, to evaluate HGS in relation to COPD severity, and to evaluate the impact of heart disease. Subjects and methods: Data were collected from the Obstructive Lung disease in Northern Sweden COPD study, where the subjects with and without COPD have been invited to annual examinations since 2005. In 2009-2010, 441 subjects with COPD (postbronchodilator forced expiratory volume in 1 second [FEV1]/vital capacity,0.70) and 570 without COPD participated in structured interviews, spirometry, and measurements of HGS. Results: The mean HGS was similar when comparing subjects with and without COPD, but those with heart disease had lower HGS than those without. When compared by Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) grades, the subjects with GOLD 3-4 had lower HGS than those without COPD in both sexes (females 21.4 kg vs 26.9 kg, P=0.010; males 41.5 kg vs 46.3 kg, P=0.038), and the difference persisted also when adjusted for confounders. Among the subjects with COPD, HGS was associated with FEV1% of predicted value but not heart disease when adjusted for height, age, sex, and smoking habits, and the pattern was similar among males and females. Conclusion: In this population-based study, the subjects with GOLD 3-4 had lower HGS than the subjects without COPD. Among those with COPD, HGS was associated with FEV1% of predicted value but not heart disease, and the pattern was similar in both sexes."
"This study reports that killer whales, the largest dolphin, produce whistles with the highest fundamental frequencies ever reported in a delphinid. Using wide-band acoustic sampling from both animal-attached (Dtag) and remotely deployed hydrophone arrays, ultrasonic whistles were detected in three Northeast Atlantic populations but not in two Northeast Pacific populations. These results are inconsistent with analyses suggesting a correlation of maximum frequency of whistles with body size in delphinids, indicate substantial intraspecific variation in whistle production in killer whales, and highlight the importance of appropriate acoustic sampling techniques when conducting comparative analyses of sound repertoires.

"Using copper-catalysed Huisgen 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition, we describe the synthesis of new A-pi-D compounds containing a pyrimidine moiety as pi-acceptor (A) and various para-substituted benzene rings as donors (D). Structure-photo-physical properties relationships revealed the triazole ring to be a better pi-conjugated linker than the triple bond."
"The aim of this study is to investigate changes in regulatory B cells (Bregs) and the expression of related cytokines such as interleukin-10 (IL-10) and transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta in a mouse model of collagen-induced arthritis (CIA). A total 20 DBA/1 mice (6-8 weeks old) were randomly divided into control and CIA disease groups. For the CIA disease group, animals were injected intradermally with chicken collagen type II and complete Freund's adjuvant. The calculated arthritis index score of the CIA group was significantly higher than that in control group. Hematoxylin and eosin staining showed tumid synovial cells with irregular arrangement and obvious hyperplasia, with a high degree of inflammatory cell infiltration in CIA model group. Cytometric bead array technology and quantitative RT-PCR indicated that the levels of IL-10 and TGF-beta in serum, and synovial cells were significantly increased in the CIA group. The proportion of Bregs in the spleen of the CIA group was significantly increased compared to the control group. In conclusion, our findings demonstrate that the number of Bregs and the expression of TGF-beta and IL-10 are enhanced in mice with CIA."
"An analysis of the international division of reproductive labor is incomplete without acknowledging the proliferation of state regulations in migrant-receiving countries, which result in restricting workers' ability to maintain their own families and to exercise their full range of labor rights. An overview of trends in nations fueling the need for domestic workers and caregivers includes the social conditions for migrants increasingly fill this niche. The transnational circuits of care migration are constructed by the commercial and legal processes used to recruit and transport domestic workers. These are highlighted by analyzing the policies in the USA and United Arab Emirates to demonstrate the restrictions countries place on migrants seeking employment and the limited labor protections offered migrant domestic workers. Two otherwise different countries have adopted similar entry requirements tying migrant domestic workers to employer sponsored jobs in their homes. However, the USA offers fewer visa options to domestic workers and recruitment systems differ. Vulnerabilities faced by migrant domestics receiving visas are linked to these immigration policies."
"The lifestyles of the indigenous people (Orang Asli) of Peninsular Malaysia who traditionally live close to the forest, put them at higher risk of exposure to zoonotic diseases. Leptospirosis has recently emerged as one of the most important diseases of public health concern. Here, we aimed to obtain a baseline data on the level of Leptospira exposure among the 107 Orang Asli volunteers using a recombinant antigen-based ELISA, previously shown to have sensitivity of similar to 90.0% in comparison to the microscopic agglutination test (MAT). Among the Orang Asli volunteers in this study, 60.7% had IgM against Leptospira and 57.9% were anti-Leptospira IgG positive. Of these seropositive individuals, 29.9% had both anti-Leptospira IgM and IgG antibodies. Age was found to be a significant predictor for exposure to Leptospira (P < 0.05) with the younger Orang Asli population more likely to be tested positive for anti-Leptospira IgM. The finding of high Leptospira exposure among the Orang Asli volunteers could be due to their socio-economic practices and dependency on the forest for their livelihood. The rapid and sensitive recombinant antigen-based ELISA used in the study, could possibly complement MAT for the epidemiological surveillance of leptospirosis, especially among the underserved populations."
"AimLow Hartmann's resection (LHR) and intersphincteric abdominoperineal excision (iAPR) are both feasible options in the treatment of rectal cancer when restoration of bowel continuity is not desired. The aim of this study was to compare the incidence of pelvic abscess and associated need for re-intervention and readmission after LHR and iAPR. MethodFrom a snapshot research project in which all rectal cancer resections from 71 Dutch hospitals in 2011 were evaluated, patients who underwent LHR or iAPR were selected. ResultsA total of 185 patients were included: 139 LHR and 46 iAPR. No differences in baseline characteristics were found except for more multivisceral resections in the iAPR group (22% vs 10%; P=0.041). Pelvic abscesses were diagnosed in 17% of the LHR group after a median of 21days (interquartile range 10-151days), compared to 11% in the iAPR group (P=0.352) after a median of 90days (interquartile range 44-269days; P=0.102). All 28 patients with a pelvic abscess underwent at least one re-intervention. Four patients (9%) in the iAPR group and nine (7%) after LHR were readmitted because of a pelvic abscess over a median 39months of follow-up. ConclusionThis cross-sectional multicentre study suggests that cross-stapling and intersphincteric resection of the rectal stump, during non-restorative rectal cancer resection, are associated with an equal risk of pelvic abscess formation and have a similar need for re-intervention and readmission."
"Permittivity measurement of materials is important in microwave chemistry, microwave material processing and microwave heating. The open-ended coaxial line method is one of the most popular and effective means for permittivity measurement. However, the conventional coaxial probe has difficulty in distinguishing small permittivity variations for low loss media. In this paper an additional S-shaped structure is proposed for sensitivity improvement of a coaxial probe for permittivity determination of low loss materials at 2.45 GHz. The small permittivity variation can be distinguished due to field enhancement generated by the additional S-shaped structure. We studied the variation of reflection coefficient amplitude for three kinds of samples with different moisture content, within the probe at different insertion depths. We find that the conventional coaxial probe cannot distinguish small permittivity variations until the moisture content of materials reaches 3%. Meanwhile, the probe with the S-shaped structure can detect such small permittivity variations when the moisture content of samples changes by only 1%. The experimental results demonstrate that the new probe proposed in this paper is reliable and feasible."
"Introduction: Youth in Uganda are disproportionately impacted by HIV and report significant barriers to ART adherence. We asked participants how fixed versus flexible adherence target setting for incentive interventions, in combination with other support systems, could help HIV-positive youth in Uganda reach medication adherence targets. Methods: Four focus groups conducted in Luganda were audiotaped, transcribed, and translated into English; the transcriptions were then coded using Dedoose software. Two members of the research team read the text and identified the basic topics covered. A codebook was developed that detailed inclusion and exclusion criteria for each topic area, as well as typical entries for each code. A directed content analysis was used to identify key themes. Results: Several themes were common across groups. Participants consistently maintained that they preferred to set their own adherence targets. But regardless of how adherence targets were assigned, participants noted that missing their target was disappointing. They commented positively on the use of MEMS caps, noting that knowing their adherence information was being tracked often encouraged them to take their medications. Participants reported that receiving text messages further motivated them to take their medications; however, on occasions when they reported not doing well, they wanted intensive follow-up by staff. Participants said that the prize drawing alone did not motivate their ART adherence and that receiving 'zero' in the drawing was disheartening. Conclusion: We found that participants preferred to set their own adherence targets and that doing so increased a sense of ownership in achieving them. All participants enjoyed using MEMS caps and expressed disappointment at needing to return the device at the study's completion. Participants noted that text message reminders may be a useful way to help patients stay motivated between clinic visits; however, ongoing engagement and support are needed from providers and counselors. Finally, our participants stressed the importance of including incentives with a small, positive value rather than 0 when designing the lowest prize."
"Various three-dimensional (3-D) talking heads have been developed lately for language learning, with both external and internal articulatory movements being visualized to guide learning. Mandarin pronunciation animation is challenging due to its confusable stops and affricates with similar places of articulation. Until now, less attention has been paid to the biosignal information of aspiratory airflow, which is essential in distinguishing Mandarin consonants. This study fills a research gap by presenting the quantitative analyses of airflow, and then designing an airflow model for a 3-D pronunciation system. The airflow information was collected by Phonatory Aerodynamic System, so that confusable consonants in Mandarin could be discerned by mean airflow rate, peak airflow rate, airflow duration, and peak time. Based on the airflow parameters, an airflow model using the physical equation of fluid flow was proposed and solved, which was then combined and synchronized with the existing 3-D articulatory model. Therefore, the new multimodal system was implemented to synchronously exhibit the airflow motions and articulatory movements of uttering Mandarin syllables. Both an audio-visual perception test and a pronunciation training study were conducted to assess the effectiveness of our system. Perceptual results indicated that identification accuracy was improved for both native and nonnative groups with the help of airflow motions, while native perceivers exhibited higher accuracy due to long-term language experience. Moreover, our system helped Japanese learners of Mandarin enhance their production skills of Mandarin aspirated consonants, reflected by higher gain values of voice onset time after training."
Radiation effects such as soft errors are the major threat to the reliability of SRAM-based FPGAs. This work analyzes the effectiveness in correcting soft errors of a novel scrubbing technique using internal frame redundancy called Frame-level Redundancy Scrubbing (FLR-scrubbing). This correction technique can be implemented in a coarse grain TMR design. The FLR-scrubbing technique was implemented on a mid-size Xilinx Virtex-5 FPGA device used as a case study. The FLR-scrubbing technique was tested under neutron radiation and fault injection. Implementation results demonstrated minimum area and energy consumption overhead when compared to other techniques. The time to repair the fault is also improved by using the Internal Configuration Access Port (ICAP). Neutron radiation test results demonstrated that the proposed technique is suitable for correcting accumulated SEUs and MBUs.
"Low P digestibility combined with intensive pig production can lead to water pollution. The aim of this paper was to develop a model able to represent P digestion in pigs across diets and contribute towards the reduction of P excretion. Phosphorus in plant feedstuffs includes some nonphytate P (NPP) that is readily digested but is mostly as organic phytate P (oP) that is indigestible unless it is dephosphorylated. The ability of pigs to dephosphorylate oP using endogenous phytase enzymes is limited and is a function of Ca intake. The effect of Ca (g/kg diet) on the proportion of oP dephosphorylated (kg/kg) in the small intestine (SI) and large intestine (LI) was determined as 0.26 - (0.015 x dietary Ca) and 0.69 - (0.059 x dietary Ca), respectively. The dephosphorylated oP in the LI was assumed to be indigestible and was excreted. Proportion of oP dephosphosphorylation (kg/kg) by microbial and plant phytase activity (FTU) in the stomach was estimated to be 0.56 x [1 - exp(-0.001 x FTU)] and 0.38 x [1 - exp(-0.002 x FTU)], respectively. Phosphorus digestibility (kg/kg) of NPP and dephosphorylated oP in the SI was assumed to be constant at 0.8. The model was used to predict P digestibility in 2 experiments by Stein et al. (2011) and Poulsen et al. (2010) and compare the predictions with experimental outcomes. The model successfully predicted the P digestibility to a range of dietary Ca concentrations and for 2 levels of supplementation with microbial phytase. However, the predictions overestimated P digestion systematically but always within a 10% margin of the observed values. The model could be a useful tool for formulating strategies to improve the efficiency of P digestion and reduce soluble P excretion in pigs."
"For the first time, chimpanzees have been observed using tools to clean the corpse of a deceased group member. A female chimpanzee sat down at the dead body of a young male, selected a firm stem of grass, and started to intently remove debris from his teeth. This report contributes novel behaviour to the chimpanzee's ethogram, and highlights how crucial information for reconstructing the evolutionary origins of human mortuary practices may be missed by refraining from developing adequate observation techniques to capture non-human animals' death responses."
"Background Congenital partial anterior arch defect of the atlas is extremely rare. It could be found as an incidental radiological finding or patients can present with neurological deficit after head or neck trauma. Objective To describe an extremely rare presentation of anterior midline cleft at the atlas and congenital posterior atlanto-occipital fusion with symptomatic anterior atlantoaxial subluxation. This report includes a feasible hypothesis for the development of this anomaly on the basis of previous hypotheses and surgical findings. Methods A 46-year-old female presented with a 6-day history of right limbs numb and left upper and lower extremities paraparesis (Frankel D). Radiographs of the cervical spine showed anterior atlantoaxial subluxation with congenital posterior atlanto-occipital fusion. Computed tomography subsequently revealed partial midline absence of the anterior arch of the atlas and the odontoid tip ahead of the anterior arch of the atlas. Magnetic resonance imaging showed that the cervical dura was compressed by the remnant of anterior arch of the atlas. The patient underwent Gardner-Wells tong traction and surgery of occipitocervical fusion with autogenous iliac bone graft because she had definite neurological symptom and congenital posterior atlanto-occipital fusion. Results Atlantoaxial reduction was confirmed with fluoroscopic X-ray evaluation by bed, her neurological deficit was resolved from Frankel D to E, and numb of right limbs completely disappeared 6 days postoperation. No instability has been observed during 2-year follow-up. Conclusion We describe the association between compressive myelopathy and congenital defect of the anterior arch of the atlas with symptomatic anterior atlantoaxial subluxation. Both computed tomography and magnetic resonance image were required to demonstrate the bony configuration and cord compression. And Gardner-Wells tong traction and surgery of occipitocervical fusion with autogenous iliac bone graft were effective as a treatment for this compressive myelopathy caused by the remnant of anterior arch of the atlas."
"To identify the unknown estrogenic disinfection by-products (DBPs) from the chlorination extract, an effective method based on affinity chromatography with immobilized human recombinant estrogen receptor alpha (ER alpha) was developed, which has an advantage in targeting different potential estrogenic compounds from mixed sample simultaneously by comparing their relative binding activities to ER. The new method worked well for six known environmental estrogens. To further test the validity of this method for unknown chemicals, six DBPs of diethylstilbestrol (DES) with relatively strong ER binding affinity after chlorination were isolated and identified. It was found that except for 2-chloro-DES which showed 1.36 times stronger binding affinity than DES, most of the by-products bound to ER much more weakly than DES. All these seven by-products induced a dose-dependent transcriptional activation in two-hybrid-yeast assays. Z,Z-dienestrol (DE) and 2-chloro-DES, which exhibiting the weakest and the strongest binding affinity, were further tested for their transcriptional potential as 0.00243 and 0.014 compared to DES, respectively. However, they were still potential harmful environmental estrogenic disruptors as their estrogenic activities were much stronger than that of bisphenol A (BPA).

"Background A one-dose-fits-all approach to use of aspirin has yielded only modest benefits in long-term prevention of cardiovascular events, possibly due to underdosing in patients of large body size and excess dosing in patients of small body size, which might also affect other outcomes. Methods Using individual patient data, we analysed the modifying effects of bodyweight (10 kg bands) and height (10 cm bands) on the effects of low doses (<= 100 mg) and higher doses (300-325 mg or =500 mg) of aspirin in randomised trials of aspirin in primary prevention of cardiovascular events. We stratified the findings by age, sex, and vascular risk factors, and validated them in trials of aspirin in secondary prevention of stroke. Additionally, we assessed whether any weight or height dependence was evident for the effect of aspirin on 20-year risk of colorectal cancer or any in-trial cancer. Results Among ten eligible trials of aspirin in primary prevention (including 117 279 participants), bodyweight varied four-fold and trial median weight ranged from 60.0 kg to 81.2 kg (p< 0.0001). The ability of 75-100 mg aspirin to reduce cardiovascular events decreased with increasing weight (p(interaction) =0.0072), with benefit seen in people weighing 50-69 kg (hazard ratio [HR] 0.75 [95% CI 0.65-0.85]) but not in those weighing 70 kg or more (0.95 [0.86-1.04]; 1.09 [0.93-1.29] for vascular death). Furthermore, the case fatality of a first cardiovascular event was increased by low-dose aspirin in people weighing 70 kg or more (odds ratio 1.33 [95% CI 1.08-1.64], p=0.0082). Higher doses of aspirin (=325 mg) had the opposite interaction with bodyweight (difference p(interaction) =0.0013), reducing cardiovascular events only at higher weight (p(interaction) =0.017). Findings were similar in men and women, in people with diabetes, in trials of aspirin in secondary prevention, and in relation to height (p(interaction) =0.0025 for cardiovascular events). Aspirin-mediated reductions in long-term risk of colorectal cancer were also weight dependent (p(interaction) =0.038). Stratification by body size also revealed harms due to excess dosing: risk of sudden death was increased by aspirin in people at low weight for dose (p(interaction) =0.0018) and risk of all-cause death was increased in people weighing less than 50 kg who were receiving 75-100 mg aspirin (HR 1.52 [95% CI 1.04-2.21], p=0.031). In participants aged 70 years or older, the 3-year risk of cancer was also increased by aspirin (1.20 [1.03-1.47], p=0.02), particularly in those weighing less than 70 kg (1.31 [1.07-1.61], p=0.009) and consequently in women (1.44 [1.11-1.87], p=0.0069). Interpretation Low doses of aspirin (75-100 mg) were only effective in preventing vascular events in patients weighing less than 70 kg, and had no benefit in the 80% of men and nearly 50% of all women weighing 70 kg or more. By contrast, higher doses of aspirin were only effective in patients weighing 70 kg or more. Given that aspirin's effects on other outcomes, including cancer, also showed interactions with body size, a one-dose-fits-all approach to aspirin is unlikely to be optimal, and a more tailored strategy is required.

"A fractal permeability model for nonwoven fabrics is developed based on the fractal characteristics of pores within them. The fractal permeability is found to be related to pore area fractal dimension, tortuosity fractal dimension, size of fibers, the maximum and minimum pore sizes, fabric thickness, and the effective porosity of a medium. To verify the validity of the proposed model, experimental work was conducted on a set of nonwoven fabrics, and the predicted air permeability was compared with the experimental results. Good concordance was found between them. Meantime, the model was also compared with the existing models and is proved to be more accurate."
