EN Main outstanding issues The Presidency invites the Permanent Representatives Committee to focus the discussion on the following three main outstanding issues","Scope - Article ( ) ( e ) , Article ( ) ( b ) , recital ( ) The delimitation of the scope of the two instruments in the pac kage the General Data Protection Regulation and the Data Protection Directive","The main concern of delegations has been to ensure that the police can use only one single instrument in their work when processing personal data","The scope as initially propos ed by the Commission linked the scope of the Directive to criminal offences","For many delegations that was too narrow","The police could encounter difficulties when dealing with separate rules on processing of personal data in a situation when police activities are not investigating of crimes , but other tasks in order to prevent threats to public security , for example when providing order on demonstrations","The scope as set out in the texts relat es - in addition to the prevention , investigation , detect ion or prosecution of criminal offences or the execution of criminal offences - also to the safeguardi ng against and the prevention of threats to public security","In the recitals to the Directive examples are set out when the Directive would be applicable and what should be excluded from its scope","Question Can the Permanent Representatives Committee endorse the Presidency suggestion for the scope of the General Data Protection Regulation ?
