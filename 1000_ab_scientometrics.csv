"Background: Scientific journals have been recognized to have the authority to register both the ownership of ideas and the validity of published knowledge. This paper explores the extent to which the editorial policies of journals contribute to ensure the accuracy of scientific authorship. Methods: Cross-sectional study of scientific authorship criteria used by 23 Spanish medical journals included in Journal Citation Reports 2008 and evaluation of their fulfilment to the uniformity requirements URM of ICMJE. Criteria have been structured in observational items and six levels of fulfilment have been established in order to quantify its adjustment to URM. Results: 52% of journals do not make a reference to URM, 39% only provides some information on the conditions lobe respected by the signatories of an article and only 26% (6 magazines) comply with URM. 61% of the journals declare information regarding the responsibility contracted by authors. 35% of the journals give some type guidelines as to the number Of authors but no one mentions signature order. As for acknowledgments and corresponding address instructions, 61% declare it but 30,4% only properly formulate their aims. Conclusions: Only 48% of the journals include one or some instructions related with scientific authorship. Results coincide with those of other studies. Despite the existence of an international standard such as URM, authorship criteria provided by journals are scarce and uneven. The assertion that URM is universally well-known by medical journals is questioned."
"With the continued development of open access policies, it is important to promote consensus-building projects with the various stakeholders. This article gives an account of how such collaboration has facilitated the construction of the project Heloise. This project is a French information service dedicated to describing the policies of French publishers on the self-archiving of scientific publications. Heloise represents a real tool of mediation whose development involved much debate between publishers and research stakeholders. This article seeks to demonstrate that the development of trust between the actors involved in the project was a major component of its success. (c) Hans Dillaerts and Ghislaine Chartron 2013"
"This study investigates the progress of highly cited research in China from 2001 to 2016 through the analysis of the Highly Cited database. The Highly Cited database, compiled by Clarivate Analytics, is comprised of the world's most influential researchers in the 22 Essential Science Indicator fields as catalogued by the Web of Science. The database is considered an international standard for the measurement of national and institutional highly cited research output. Overall, we found a consistent and substantial increase in Highly Cited Researchers from China during the timespan. The Chinese institutions with the most Highly Cited Researchers-the Chinese Academy of Sciences, Tsinghua University, Peking University, Zhejiang University, the University of Science and Technology of China, and BGI Shenzhen- are all top ten universities or primary government research institutions. Further evaluation of separate fields of research and government funding data from the National Natural Science Foundation of China revealed disproportionate growth efficiencies among the separate divisions of the National Natural Science Foundation. The most development occurred in the fields of Chemistry, Materials Sciences, and Engineering, whereas the least development occurred in Economics and Business, Health Sciences, and Life Sciences."
"Objective: To analyse scientific papers published by Chinese authors in nursing journals included in the Science Citation Index Expanded and compare the published scientific papers from mainland China (ML), Taiwan (TW) and Hong Kong (HK). Methods: All articles published in 62 journals that were related to nursing originating from ML, TW and HK from 1999 to 2008 were retrieved from the PubMed and Institute for Scientific Information (ISI) Web of Knowledge database. The total number of articles published in nursing journals, impact factors and citation reports and articles were estimated for quantity and quality comparisons. Results: The number of articles from the three regions increased significantly from 1999 to 2008. There were 1015 articles in total from the three regions: ML (48), HK (414) and TW (553) in PubMed. In the ISI Web of Knowledge database, TW derived the highest total citations (1755 citations from 500 articles), followed by HK (1316 citations from 347 articles) and ML (158 citations from 55 articles). HK had the highest average citations of 3.79, followed by TW (3.51) and then ML (2.87). Discussion: The difference between the quantity and quality of nursing research articles published in ML, TW and HK is significant, although the gap appears to be narrowing. Long-term job stresses, low levels of education and language barriers are likely the main factors. ML, TW and HK have the same culture and ethnicity. We expect that ML will benefit significantly from increased exchanges with TW and HK in nursing research and education. We also speculate that TW and HK will benefit from exchanges because ML may have diverse nursing problems."
"This paper deals with the bibliometric study of the research concerning the San Andreas Fault System (SAFS), an extraordinary example of a complex boundary between the North of America and the Pacific plates that can be seen, followed and studied on land for hundreds of kilometers through California, in the USA. The bibliometric analysis discussed here considers the time span of 23 years, from 1991 to 2013. The bibliographic databases taken as a reference are the Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED) and the Social Sciences Citation Index (SSCI) accessed via Web of Science Core Collection. After having selected the proper search terms to fix the query and extracting the useful information from the two Web of Science (WoS) databases, we performed the analysis of the outputs paying attention to the document typology and languages, journals, subject categories, authors, articles, countries, institutions, and keywords. The results of this study can (1) contribute to see how the research on SAFS has changed over the time and suggest clues about the future investigation trends, (2) help scientists or institutions to build a research network and find strategic partners, (3) suggest scientists and institutions the dissemination strategies, and (4) provide helpful information to researchers wishing to embark on work in this area."
"Principles and criteria used by the National Evaluation Committee of Research Activity (CNEAI-Spain) for the assessment of scientific publications: 1989-2009. Study of the origins, philosophy and history of the criteria used to assess research activities in Spain by the CNEAI. The assessment criteria and quality evidence of publications is discussed. Results are presented on the temporal development of the criteria used, grouped by publication type (articles and books) and fields of knowledge. Between 1989-1996, assessment was based on the definition and goals set by the Spanish scientific framework and on general criteria. Between 1996-2004. the formulation of indicators began to be almost exclusively based on Journal Citation Reorts (JCR). Success rates up to 2004 indicate that the evaluation criteria and publishing behaviour matched the ""hard sciences"", hut not the Social Sciences and Economics. In 2005, the criteria used were further developed and reoriented with an eye to softening the preceding JCR-centrism by taking into consideration other databases and defining the quality criteria to be met by journals, books and conferences not included in JCR. Correspondingly, the success rates for 2007 indicate a dramatic recovery in Economics, In the last 4 years, Humanities and Social Sciences have consolidated the further opening of the criteria used with the addition of new benchmarks and the full integration of books."
"Purpose - This article aims to explore the geographic distribution of open access practices in the world from a diffusionist perspective. Design/methodology/approach - The article applies a tempo-spatial analysis to examine the diffusion movement of open access practices from the West to the entire world during the past several decades. Both maps and tables are used to support the analysis. The diffusionist theory is reviewed and applied to the understanding of open access. Findings - The paper discovers that technology is not the only factor determining the diffusion pattern of information systems as discussed in the literature. Cultural dissimilarities across countries have played a significant role in open access development. Open access can only be effectively established after it meets local standards. Practical implications - The findings help understanding of why open access has a disproportionate growth among developing countries, and even among developed countries, where the ICT infrastructure has been in place. Originality/value - Few studies have taken a transnational view to analyze open access geography at the global level, and few have been able to synthesize models to interpret diverse discoveries. Furthermore, a chronological evaluation tracing the history of open access spatial expansion is absent in the literature."
"Purpose - The study aims to monitor the status of open access (OA) journals published in Developing 8 (D-8) countries, i.e. Bangladesh, Egypt, Indonesia, Iran, Malaysia, Nigeria, Pakistan and Turkey. Design/methodology/approach - The authors' web-based data sources for journal-based metrics were the Directory of Open Access Journals (DOAJ), Thomson Reuters (Journal Citation Reports [JCR], which provided journal impact factors [JIF]) and Scopus (source normalized impact per paper [SNIP] and SCImago journal rank [SJR]). The authors obtained information about journals published before 2000 to 2014. From the JCR, JIF, Rank in Category, Total Journals in Category, Journal Rank in Category, and Quartile in Category were used. Findings - The authors' identified 1,407 OAJ published in D-8 countries. Egypt published the most journals (490) and Bangladesh the fewest (29). Egypt, Iran and Turkey accounted for approximately 73.5 per cent of all journals. At the time of study, 10,162 journals were registered in DOAJ, and 13.8 per cent of them were published in D-8 countries. The mean JIF for all journals from individual countries was highest for Pakistan (0.84), followed by Iran (0.74) and Turkey (0.57). The mean SNIP for all journals from each country was highest for Nigeria (0.57), followed by Egypt (0.57) and Pakistan (0.51). Practical implications - The widespread use of OA publishing models in D-8 countries will boost accessibility of their journals' content and ultimately impact research in D-8 states. Originality/value - Journals published in Egypt, Iran and Turkey account for approximately three-fourths of all OA journals published in D-8 countries. More than one-third (38 per cent) of the journals the authors studied used a Creative Commons (CC) BY license, a hallmark of OA research findings. Most of the journals with a JIF were in the JCR Medical Sciences category (60 per cent). As the number of journals in D-8 countries increases, publishers should attempt to make their journals eligible for indexing in-citation databases. The authors recommend efforts to improve the quality of journals in other subject categories, so that as many as possible become eligible for indexing in JCR."
"Research assessment exercises aim to identify research quantity and quality and provide insights into research capacity building strategies for the future. Yet with limited knowledge of the ecology of Australian educational research, there is little chance of understanding what research audits might contribute towards a capacity building agenda for such a complex field. This paper draws on secondary data analysis of research outputs submitted by 13 Australian higher education institutions to the Excellence in Research for Australia (ERA) 2010 and 2012 national research assessment exercises, to show where Australian educational research is conducted. Findings offer a profile of education researchers by location in academic organisational units within universities. By analyzing data not accessible through reported ERA data we were also able to present information about appointment profiles, specifically levels and type of appointment within universities, as well as data on institutional and geographic region, and patterns associated with type of outputs (books, book chapters, journal articles, conference papers and other outputs) and field of research. Analysis of the data reveals definitive shifts in the nature of the published outputs and in employment profiles of researchers and their location across university and regional groupings. Research audits are administrative processes that reshape institutional and disciplinary governance structures, policies, individual outputs, work practices and careers, but they are not the sum total of the field per se."
"Prior research has investigated the relationships between communication, collaboration and production of information/knowledge. Most of this research has been conducted either in developed countries where the internet facility is highly advanced or in developing countries with little internet access. Investigations in countries that fall in between these two extremes are rare. This study of respondents from higher education institutions and research institutes examines the relationship between collaboration and internet use, as well as productivity and internet use in the South African scientific system which has become a strong contributor to science in Africa."
"Background The UK, like some other countries, carries out a periodic review of research quality in universities and the most recent Research Excellence Framework (REF) reported a doubling (103% increase) in its ""world leading"" or so-called ""4*"" research outputs in the areas of life sciences and medicine between 2008 and 2014. This is a remarkable improvement in six years and if validated internationally could have profound implications for health sciences. Methods We compared the reported changes in 4* quality to bibliometric measures of quality for the 56,639 articles submitted to the RAE 2008 and the 50,044 articles submitted to the REF 2014 to Panel A, which assesses the life sciences, including medicine. Findings UK research submitted to the RAE and REF was of better quality than worldwide research on average. While we found evidence for some increase in the quality of top UK research articles, a 10-25% increase in the top 10% ile papers, depending upon the metrics used, we could not find evidence to support a 103% increase in quality. Instead we found that as compared to the RAE, the REF results implied a lower citation % ile threshold for declaring a 4*. Interpretation There is a wide discrepancy between bibliometric indices and peer-review panel judgements between the RAE 2008 and REF 2014. It is possible that the changes in the funding regime between 2008 and 2014 that significantly increased the financial premium for 4* articles may have influenced research quality evaluation. For the advancement of science and health, evaluation of research quality requires consistency and validity - the discrepancy noted here calls for a closer examination of mass peer- review methods like the REF."
"Objective The extent to which biomedical authors have received training in publication ethics, and their attitudes and opinions about the ethical aspects of specific behaviours, have been understudied. We sought to characterise the knowledge and attitudes of biomedical authors about common issues in publication ethics. Design Cross-sectional online survey. Setting and participants Corresponding authors of research submissions to 20 journals. Main outcome measure(s) Perceived level of unethical behaviour (rated 0 to 10) presented in five vignettes containing key variables that were experimentally manipulated on entry to the survey and perceived level of knowledge of seven ethical topics related to publishing (prior publication, author omission, self-plagiarism, honorary authorship, conflicts of interest, image manipulation and plagiarism). Results 4043/10 582 (38%) researchers responded. Respondents worked in 100 countries and reported varying levels of publishing experience. 67% (n=2700) had received some publication ethics training from a mentor, 41% (n=1677) a partial course, 28% (n=1130) a full course and 55% (n=2206) an online course; only a small proportion rated training received as excellent. There was a full range (0 to 10 points) in ratings of the extent of unethical behaviour within each vignette, illustrating a broad range of opinion about the ethical acceptability of the behaviours evaluated, but these opinions were little altered by the context in which it occurred. Participants reported substantial variability in their perceived knowledge of seven publication ethics topics; one-third perceived their knowledge to be less than some knowledge' for the sum of the seven ethical topics and only 9% perceived substantial knowledge' of all topics. Conclusions We found a large degree of variability in espoused training and perceived knowledge, and variability in views about how ethical or unethical scenarios were. Ethical standards need to be better articulated and taught to improve consistency of training across institutions and countries."
"This paper presents methods to develop metrics that compare Big Deal journal packages and the journals within those packages. Deal-level metrics guide selection of a Big Deal for termination. Journal-level metrics guide selection of individual subscriptions from journals previously provided by a terminated deal. The paper argues that, while the proposed metrics provide helpful quantitative data for comparative analysis, selection of individual subscriptions must also involve informed judgment about a library's subject coverage needs and alternative sources of access. The paper also discusses how replacing a Big Deal with a reduced number of individual subscriptions may affect the collections budget, use of other resources, and interlibrary loan."
Rankings of journals and rankings of scientists are usually discussed separately. We argue that a consistent approach to both rankings is desirable because both the quality of a journal and the quality of a scientist depend on the papers it/he publishes. We present a pair of consistent rankings (impact factor for the journals and total number of citations for the authors) and we provide an axiomatic characterization thereof.

Plagiarism is a serious threat plaguing the research in publication of science globally. There is an increasing need to address the issue of plagiarism especially among young researchers in the developing part of the world. Plagiarism needs to be earnestly discouraged to ensure a plagiarism free research environment. We provide further suggestions to combat student plagiarism at Master's level and the regulations/guidelines regarding plagiarism in India.
"This study examines the impact of collaborating patterns on the R&D performance of public research institutions (PRIs) in Korea's science and engineering fields. For the construction of R&D collaborating networks based on the co-authorship data of 127 institutions in Scopus, this paper proposes four types of collaborations by categorizing network analyses into two dimensions: structural positions (density, efficiency, and betweeness centrality) and the relational characteristics of individual nodes (eigenvector and closeness centralities). To explore the research performance by collaboration type, we employ a data envelopment analysis window analysis of a panel of 23 PRIs over a 10-year period. Comparing the R&D productivities of each group, we find that the PRIs of higher productivity adhere to a cohesive networking strategy, retaining intensive relations with their existing partners. The empirical results suggest that excessively cohesive alliances might end up in 'lock-in' relations, hindering the exploitation of new opportunities for innovation. These findings are implicit in relation to the Korean Government's R&D policies on collaborating strategies to produce sustained research results with the advent of the convergence research era."
"Objectives: To conduct a bibliometric evaluation and trend prediction of English literature on animal-derived regenerative implantable medical devices based on tissue engineering technology. Methods: Data identified by a search strategy with eleven combinations of keywords before 1 January, 2014 were downloaded from eight databases on 25 November, 2014. The study analysed publication year, journal preference, authors' geographic location and research topics. Results: Research on animal-derived regenerative implantable medical devices is gradually increasing. The majority of the first authors are from colleges or universities. Approximately one-third of the papers were the result of cooperation of different institutions. The top five productive countries are the United States, China, UK, Germany and Italy. Biomaterials are the main literature source. Bradford's law analysis shows that a core journal area has formed. The active areas of research and future research directions are 'scaffold materials', 'biocompatibility', 'growth factors' and 'extracellular matrix'. Conclusion: Research of animal-derived regenerative implantable medical devices has attracted more and more attention from the academia. But most of the research achievements are generated by a few developed countries. Researchers around the world need to complement each other in knowledge and academic resources by communication and cooperation."
"The purpose of this study was to summarise recent research activity from 2009 to 2013 of faculty in Canadian developmental psychology programs, as there have been no previous studies on this stream in Canada. Rankings for research productivity (i.e., number of publications) and impact (e.g., citation counts) were evaluated using the Publish or Perish software. Various metrics of impact factor were calculated (e.g., h-index, h(I)-index, h(I), (annual)-index, and g-index). These metrics were evaluated both with and without the most contributing faculty member to examine both the breadth and depth of each program. Overall, while some universities had relatively stable rankings across all the metrics, rankings for other universities fluctuated depending on the metric and whether or not the top contributing faculty member was included. Implications for both students and faculty members with respect to graduate studies are discussed."
"The scientific community of Latin America (LA) has developed international leadership in tropical medicine research which has influenced the decline of diseases such as Chagas and malaria. Contributions of authors, institutions and scientific journals from Brazil and Colombia stand out in the struggle of more than 100 years to eradicate tropical diseases. Our aim in the present paper is to study how this international leadership has influenced the communication patterns of two of the regional journals that have aided in the construction of this prestige: Memorias do Instituto Oswaldo Cruz (MIOC) from Brazil and Biomedica from Colombia, during the period of greatest international visibility of LA scientific journals, 2007-2015. The texts of the mentioned journals are used to study the relations of intertextuality between references and citations. Authors, references and citations of each text were classified according to three geographical origins: local, regional, and external. Resulting correlations are identified and compared. MIOC and Biomedica have improved their editorial policies and increased the international visibility of their papers without commercial publishing alliances and without changing their historical institutional mandate. The role played by Biomedica and MIOC has matured as accreditation sources of papers originating from the three geographical regions explored in the present work. We hope that this trend will continue and that both journals will play an increasingly more active role in the international system of scientific communication."
"VOS is a new mapping technique that can serve as an alternative to the well-known technique of multidimensional scaling (MDS). We present an extensive comparison between the use of MDS and the use of VOS for constructing bibliometric maps. In our theoretical analysis, we show the mathematical relation between the two techniques. In our empirical analysis, we use the techniques for constructing maps of authors, journals, and keywords. Two commonly used approaches to bibliometric mapping, both based on MDS, turn out to produce maps that suffer from artifacts. Maps constructed using VOS turn out not to have this problem. We conclude that in general maps constructed using VOS provide a more satisfactory representation of a dataset than maps constructed using well-known MDS approaches."
"Retractions are rare in science, but there is growing concern about the impact retracted papers have. We present data on the retractions in the journal Science, between 1983 and 2017. Each year, approximately 2.6 papers are retracted; that is about 0.34% of the papers published in the journal. 30% of the retracted papers are retracted within 1year of publication. Some papers are retracted almost 12years after publication. 51% of the retracted papers are retracted due to honest mistakes. Smaller research teams of 2-4 scientists are responsible for a disproportionately larger share of the retracted papers especially when it comes to retractions due to honest mistakes. In 60% of thecases all authors sign the retraction notice."
"Predatory open access is a controversial publishing business model that exploits the open-access system by charging publication fees in the absence of transparent editorial services. The credibility of academic publishing is now seriously threatened by predatory journals, whose articles are accorded real citations and thus contaminate the genuine scientific records of legitimate journals. This is of particular concern for public health since clinical practice relies on the findings generated by scholarly articles. Aim of this study was to compile a list of predatory journals targeting the neurosciences and neurology disciplines and to analyze the magnitude and geographical distribution of the phenomenon in these fields. Eighty-seven predatory journals operate in neurosciences and 101 in neurology, for a total of 2404 and 3134 articles issued, respectively. Publication fees range 521-637 USD, much less than those charged by genuine open-access journals. The country of origin of 26.0-37.0% of the publishers was impossible to determine due to poor websites or provision of vague or non-credible locations. Of the rest 35.3-42.0% reported their headquarters in the USA, 19.0-39.2% in India, 3.0-9.8% in other countries. Although calling themselves ""open-access"", none of the journals retrieved was listed in the Directory of Open Access Journals. However, 14.9-24.7% of them were found to be indexed in PubMed and PubMed Central, which raises concerns on the criteria for inclusion of journals and publishers imposed by these popular databases. Scholars in the neurosciences are advised to use all the available tools to recognize predatory practices and avoid the downsides of predatory journals. (C) 2017 IBRO. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

"This paper aims to identify the conceptual structure in the category Library and Information Sciences in the Web of Science, in the period 2007-2017, using the analytical tool Essential Science indicators. Based on highly cited papers, the methodology consisted in the application of co-word analysis and multivariate analysis techniques and visualization through science mapping. The main results showed that the studies on Web 20 based on the collaborative participation of the users, the evaluation of scientific activities, as well as the alternative metrics developed in the social and academic platforms, such as Altmetrics, trust in virtual environments, and the application of information technologies in companies and digital e-commerce platforms were the areas of greatest interest to the researchers."
"The Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI) was created recently, in 2015, but few assessments of its journal coverage have been made. The present study tries to fill that gap by comparing its coverage with that of other international abstracting and indexing (A&I) databases. Using this measure, it is feasible to benchmark this index against the other citation indexes for acceptance criteria. We analysed 6,296 ESCI-indexed journals, 8,889 Science Citation Index Expanded (SCIE), 3,258 Social Science Citation Index (SSCI), 1,784 Arts and Humanities Citation Index (AHCI), and 22,749 Scopus journals as indexed in July 2017 to determine their inclusion in 105 databases. We found that 19.3% of the ESCI journals are not covered by any other A&I databases, a high figure compared with only 0.5% SCIE, 0.3% SSCI, 0.3% AHCI, and 5.5% Scopus journals. This low coverage suggests that the selection criteria for ESCI journals are not consistent with the overall trend in the other classical citation indexes."
"Bibliometric indicators of production and impact of e-learning research are analyzed to know the contribution of countries and institutions in the scientific development of this subject and to strengthen its characterization as knowledge domain. We extracted bibliometric indicators from 39,244 documents indexed in Scopus and SCImago Institutional Rankings, and generated maps of production and collaboration networks and graphics about the impact of e-learning research in countries and institutions. The results of this combined analysis showed that at country level the United States produce most of the works and generated the greatest international collaboration. At institutional level, the University of Hong Kong is the most productive and National Taiwan University of Science and Technology is the one with the greatest collaboration. In addition, the analysis showed that Taiwan ranks first in productivity and impact, which is why we linked these results to a brief analysis of its national policies. This study presents a new method to analyze both emerging and established knowledge domains."
"The distributions of citations L, two- (IF2) and five-year impact factors (IF5), and citation half-lives lambda of journals published in different selected countries are analyzed using Langmuir-type relation: y(n) = y(0) {1 - alpha Kn/(1 + Kn)}, where y(n) denotes L-n, IF2(n) or IF5(n) of n-ranked journal, y(0) is the value of y(n) when journal rank n = 0, alpha is an empirical effectiveness parameter, and K is the Langmuir constant. It was found that: (1) the general features of the distribution of L-n, IF2(n) or IF5(n) of the journals published in different individual countries are similar to the results obtained before by the author from the analysis of the citation distribution data of papers of individual authors (K. Sangwal,Journal of Informetrics 7 (2013) 36-49), (2) in contrast to the theoretically expected value of the effectiveness parameter alpha = 1, the calculated values of alpha > 1 for journals published in different countries, (3) the trends of the distribution of cited half-lives lambda(n) of journals differ from those of L-n, IF2(n) and IF5(n) data for different countries, and show one, two or three linear regions, the longest linear regions with low slopes are observed in the case of countries publishing relatively high number of journals, and (4) the product of the Langmuir constant K and the number N of journals for the processes of citations and two- and five-year impact factors of journals published in different countries is constant for a process. The results suggest that: (1) the values of alpha > 1 are associated with a process that retards the generation of items (i.e. citations or impact factors), the difference (alpha - 1) being related to the dissemination of contents of the journals published by a country, and (2) the constancy of KN is related to the publication potential of a country.

"Despite the social importance of awards, they have been largely disregarded by academic research in economics. This paper investigates whether receiving prestigious academic awards the John Bates Clark Medal and the Fellowship of the Econometric Society is associated with higher subsequent research productivity and status compared to a synthetic control group of non-recipient scholars with similar previous research performance. Our results suggest statistically significant positive publication and citation differences after award receipt. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."
"In this article a new form for the evaluation of scientific articles under peer review is presented. This proposal is based on some empirical observations with respect to the process through which scientific knowledge is built. The principles underlying this proposal are simplicity, agility and clarity in the feedback for authors. Some of the weaknesses of peer review could be addressed by applying this new procedure."
"An increasing number of higher education institutions worldwide are requiring submission of electronic theses and dissertations (ETDs) by graduate students and are subsequently providing open access to these works in online repositories. Faculty advisors and graduate students are concerned that such unfettered access to their work could diminish future publishing opportunities. This study investigated social sciences, arts, and humanities journal editors' and university press directors' attitudes toward ETDs. The findings indicate that manuscripts that are revisions of openly accessible ETDs are always welcome for submission or considered on a case-by-case basis by 82.8 percent of journal editors and 53.7 percent of university press directors polled."
"Scientific production is steadily growing, exhibiting 4% annual growth in publications and 1.8% annual growth in the number of references per publication, together producing a 12-year doubling period in the total supply of references, i.e. links in the science citation network. This growth has far-reaching implications for how academic knowledge is connected, accessed and evaluated. Against this background, we analyzed a citation network comprised of 837 million references produced by 32.6 million publications over the period 1965-2012, allowing for a detailed analysis of the 'attention economy' in science. Our results show how growth relates to 'citation inflation', increased connectivity in the citation network resulting from decreased levels of uncitedness, and a narrowing range of attention as both very classic and very recent literature are being cited increasingly less. The decreasing attention to recent literature published within the last 6 years suggests that science has become stifled by a publication deluge destabilizing the balance between production and consumption. To better understand these patterns together, we developed a generative model of the citation network, featuring exponential growth, the redirection of scientific attention via publications' reference lists, and the crowding out of old literature by the new. We validate our model against several empirical benchmarks, and then use perturbation analysis to measure the impact of shifts in citing behavior on the synthetic system's properties, thereby providing insights into the functionality of the science citation network as an infrastructure supporting the memory of science.

"Scientific writing is about communicating ideas. Today, simplicity is more important than ever. Scientist are overwhelmed with new information. The overall growth rate for scientific publication over the last few decades has been at least 4.7 % per year, which means doubling publication volume every 15 years. I measure simplicity/readability with proportion of adjectives and adverbs in a paper, and find natural science to be the most readable and social science the least readable."
"Through the bibliometric approach and citation analysis, this study analyzes the disciplines and subjects of literature citing important information science journals during the period from 1998 to 2010. The four information science journals under study include Journal of the American Society for Information Science and Technology, Information Processing and Management, the Journal of Information Science, and the Journal of Documentation. The Ulrich's Periodical Directory, Library of Congress Subject Headings retrieved from WorldCat and the LISA database were used to identify the main classes, subclasses, and subjects of citing journals. We also indentify and analyze the highly citing journals, the main classes and subclasses of citing journals for the four journals under study as well as highly cited subjects in journals related to library and information science. Overall, the knowledge flow out of the domain of information science mainly includes information science itself, and also science and technology at a lower percentage. Moreover, there are minor outputs for various other subjects. The comparison of knowledge flow into and out of the domain of information science reveals the main knowledge flow is into information science itself. This comparison also reveals significant knowledge flow from computer science to information science."
"Water security has been an emerging and rapidly developing new research area. A bibiometric study is very helpful. By sufficiently analyzing the data from all related items between 1998 and 2015 obtained in Web of Science databases, we found the publications in overall scopes, various subjects, countries or journals all matched logistic growths with large value of K (maximum possible publication) and small value of b (related to growth rate). The most promising subjects were environmental sciences and water resources, and Zipf's law of publication distribution in all subjects was satisfied. USA owned maximum publications, whereas Canada had a more latent capacity. USA and UK dominated the collaborative network. With ""Water Science and Technology'' as the most active journal, the Bradford's scattering distribution of publications in all journals was elucidated. The productivity of the authors showed a rough Lotka's distribution. Besides ""water security'' and ""water safety'', ""climate change'' was the hottest keyword. The co-words patterns revealed the wide mutual influences between water security and climate change. No significant aging for the highly cited publications implied the past, future and vitality of rapidly-developing water security research. Our findings drawn from a suite of bibliometric indicators are instructive for the future studies of researchers, the strategy/policy of countries and the efforts of publishing organizations, altogether prompting the global water security research."
"Australia is a vast country with an average distance of 1911 km between its eight state capital cities. The quantitative impact of this distance on collaboration practices between Australian universities and between different types of Australian universities has not been examined previously and hence our knowledge about the spatial distribution effects, if any, on collaboration practices and opportunities is very limited. The aim of the study reported here was therefore to analyse the effect of distance on the collaboration activities of humanities, arts and social science scholars in Australia, using co-authorship as a proxy for collaboration. In order to do this, gravity models were developed to determine the distance effects on external collaboration between universities in relation to geographic region and institutional alliance of 25 Australian universities. Although distance was found to have a weak impact on external collaboration, the strength of the research publishing record within a university (internal collaboration) was found to be an important factor in determining external collaboration activity levels. This finding would suggest that increasing internal collaboration within universities could be an effective strategy to encourage external collaboration between universities. This strategy becomes even more effective for universities that are further away from each other. Establishing a hierarchical structure of different types of universities within a region can optimise the location advantage in the region to encourage knowledge exchange within that region. The stronger network could also attract more collaboration between networks."
"Learning to search on the Web of Science: A reply to the Aluja, Becona, Botella, Colom, Echeburua, Forns, Perez and Vila (2011) study. The aims of this paper are, on the one hand, to present the differences in the results that may be incurred when working with some automated database functions to obtain scientific production and, on the other hand, to reveal the mistakes made by Aluja et al. (2011) in their considerations and suggestions to the study of Olivas-Avila and Musi-Lechuga (2010a). In this paper, we show that the procedure used to replicate the study is incorrect and, therefore, the authors did not only confuse production with diffusion indicators, but also suggest many indicators that have no discriminative power with the sample studied, - and the most striking - one hundred percent out of the ten cases analyzed were incorrectly analyzed and, therefore, the results do not correspond to the real record count in the Web of Science (WoS). In some cases, the errors involved items omitted from the WoS. The authors also propose rates like the percentage of articles in journals of Spanish spheres, or the percentage of items as first author. These indexes have no theoretical or empirical justification or previous studies that support them."
"Characteristics of citation and language in publications of German authors from the journal ""Der Chirurg"" (vol 78, 2007) were analysed. Out of a total of 3,342 citations, 756 (22.62%) were from German authors with 248 (32.8) self-citations. The hegemony of the impact factor in science, research and education is critically discussed. The imbalance between the number of surgeons in the US and United Kingdom (66,032) and surgeons in the German speaking countries in Europe (25,300) is compared with respect to the counting methods used to create the impact factor of a journal. The creation of an independent impact factor in Europe and the development of an EU-based citation data bank which allows unselected access to national language scientific literature are strongly needed."
"Public transport research involves a lot of disciplinary and interdisciplinary research applying methods, techniques, and technologies to investigate, regulate, and advance public transport. The importance of research in this area has led to a huge amount of publications in recent years. In this study, we conducted a comprehensive scientometric analysis of related literature published in 2009-2013 to empirically explore the consistence, focus areas, and key contributors of public transport research from a meta-perspective, providing novel insights into publication patterns, major topics, research impact, and productivity by focusing on short-term developments. As such, the results of this study provide a novel perspective on public transport research and may help achieving an overview on important characteristics."
"The three much cited laws of scientometrics are the laws of Bradford, Lotka and Zipf. The authors briefly review the scientific career of the men behind the names, and that how they discovered the laws named after them. An outline is also given of the scientific aftermath of the laws and of the oeuvre of their eponym."
"The paper addresses the question of how, in a research-intensive university, choices should be made to determine strategies that are appropriate for ambitious and creative institutions committed to both teaching and research at a high level. The paper calls for accountable real leadership at the university level and at lower levels. It also calls for organizational flexibility and flexibility in the allocation of material and immaterial resources."
"We describe mathematically the age-independent version of the h-index, defined by Abt (Scientometrics 91(3):863-868, 2012) and explain when this indicator is constant with age. We compare this index with the one where not the h-index is divided by career length but where all citation numbers are divided by career length and where we then calculate the new h-index. Both mathematical models are compared. A variant of this second method is by calculating the h-index of the citation data, divided by article age. Examples are given."
"The introduction of the European Higher Education Area (EHEA) has resulted in the transformation of higher education in Spain. However, the attitude of university teaching staff and how this reform has affected their teaching and research functions are unknown. Therefore, the level of satisfaction towards different aspects related to the EHEA has been evaluated. The participants were 1,958 teachers from the Science field in Spanish public universities. It is a population-based, descriptive study using a cross-sectional survey with a probability sample. Firstly, a sample selection with a confidence level of 97% was carried out. Then, a questionnaire was created for the purpose, applied online and made up of questions related to personal and professional information; general and institutional aspects of the EHEA; teaching, research and management; methodology and the teaching and learning process; student assessment; teacher training; coordination, organization and centre resources; additional comments and suggestions for improvement. Cronbach's alpha coefficient was 0.80. The results revealed the dissatisfaction of most of the teachers regarding the way in which Science degrees have been adapted to the EHEA (46.4%), followed by 44% who declared that it could be improved. Several possible solutions were also proposed to be considered when implementing efficient educational policies to improve higher education in Spain. Finally, an insight is given into the influence of the European convergence process in the professional development of teaching staff in this field and the consequences in the educational and scientific area."
"This study explores the evolution of institutional collaborations in articles published in the Strategic Management Journal between 1980 and 2014 via descriptive analysis and social network analysis. These analyses show that, in each sub-period, the number of institutions involved, as measured by papers published, increased significantly and a significant number of new institutions participated in the strategic management community via the SMJ. However, a few institutions from the US dominated the field. The collaboration network was weakly clustered, fragmented, and scattered, and the relationship among institutions was not close. International collaborations have been growing based on center-periphery, international trade, and social factors, instead of geographic proximity. An inclusive evaluation of the results, limitations, and suggestions for future research is provided."
"Purpose: To test whether there is an association between the growth in the number of ophthalmic journals in the past years and their mean and maximum impact factor (IF) as a common sign of scientific proliferation. Methods: Using data from the 2013 Journal Citation Report database a study of the major clinical medical fields was conducted to assess the correlation between the number of journals and maximum IF in a given field in the year 2013. In the field of ophthalmology, we examined the correlation between year, number of journals, mean IF and maximum IF in the field of ophthalmology throughout the years 2000-2013. Results: In the major medical fields, a positive correlation was found between the number of journals and the maximum IF (quadratic R-2 = 0.71, P < 0.001). When studying the field of ophthalmology a positive correlation between the number of journals and mean IF (R-2 = 0.84, P < 0.001) and between number of journals and maximum IF (R-2 = 0.71, P < 0.001) was detected. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that the variation in the IF can be explained by the number of journals in the field of ophthalmology. In the future, the formation of additional ophthalmology journals is likely to further increase the IFs of existing journals."
"Recruiting qualified reviewers, though challenging, is crucial for ensuring a fair and robust scholarly peer review process. We conducted a survey of 307 reviewers of submissions to the International Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems (CHI 2011) to gain a better understanding of their motivations for reviewing. We found that encouraging high-quality research, giving back to the research community, and finding out about new research were the top general motivations for reviewing. We further found that relevance of the submission to a reviewer's research and relevance to the reviewer's expertise were the strongest motivations for accepting a request to review, closely followed by a number of social factors. Gender and reviewing experience significantly affected some reviewing motivations, such as the desire for learning and preparing for higher reviewing roles. We discuss implications of our findings for the design of future peer review processes and systems to support them."
"Objective: to analyse research articles on pain and nursing issues using bibliometric and scientometric methodologies. Method: articles in the Web of Science database containing pain and nurse and pain and nursing were analyzed using scientometric methods through data visualization techniques and advanced text analytics. Result: among the 107,559 research articles found in the field of nursing, 3,976 of them were written based on the keywords pain and nursing, and were considered in conformity with the scope of this study. Preliminary analyses indicated that the publications have increased through the years with minor fluctuations. Titles, keywords, and abstracts were analyzed through text analytics to reveal keyword clusters and topic structures. Studies on oncology and pain in the field of nursing have a relatively higher frequency. Conclusion: the results of the analyses revealed the characteristics of the current literature in a broad range of areas by considering the particular dimensions. Therefore, the findings may support present and future research in this field by shedding light on the networks, trends, and contents in the related literature."
"This study aimed to gather the opinions of editors of Library and Information Science journals indexed in Scopus and the Web of Knowledge regarding the current situation and their forecasts on open access, peer review procedures, functionalities, and specialization. The response rate was 23%, and some noteworthy conclusions can be drawn according to editors' opinions: Within 5-10 years, the main business model for journal publishing will be open access. Institutional support is the preferred source of financing. The review process requires less than 2 months, and the main problems are low quality of texts and finding reviewers. Functionalities such as mobile versions of the journals, social media, data policy, and altmetrics have yet to be exploited; interdisciplinarity will increase the presence of these functionalities in journals, especially through the influence of the related areas of Communication, Management, and Computer Science. Finally, the area that will see the most changes is the management of research data."
"In this paper, we estimate the impact of receiving an NIH postdoctoral training grant on subsequent publications and citations. Our sample consists of all applications for NIH postdoctoral training grants (unsuccessful as well as successful) from 1980 to 2000. Both ordinary least squares and regression discontinuity estimates show that receipt of an NIH postdoctoral fellowship leads to about one additional publication over the next five years, which reflects a 20% increase in research productivity.

"A majority of international branch campuses (IBCs) have been established during the last two decades, with China, Malaysia, Qatar, and the United Arab Emirates being the countries hosting the largest numbers. IBCs are often considered education providers within the host country; but there has been ongoing debate about their role as contributors to the scientific wealth of the host country. This study develops a methodology to investigate the research activity at branch campuses based on their publications. The main methodological challenge was to identify publications from these entities, as they are often not indexed and visible in the publication databases. This was solved through a search query extracting publications with affiliation data including the host country or city for the branch campus as well as the name of the institution. Using the publication sets for each research active IBC, the study illustrates not only that they are increasingly active in research, but also how their publication quality and collaboration patterns relate to their host country as well as to their home institution. The results also indicate that IBCs appear to have a role in the academic research development of some hosting countries; Qatar, the United Arab Emirates and Malaysia."
"Productivity of individuals and institutions in educational psychology journals has been previously examined in three separate studies (Hsieh et al. [Hsieh, P., Acee, T., Chung, W., Hsieh, Y., Kim, H., Thomas, G. D., et al. (2004). An alternate look at educational psychologist's productivity from 1991 to 2002. Contemporary Educational Psychology, 29, 333-343]; Smith et al. [Smith, M. C., Locke, S. G., Boisse, S. J., Gallagher, P. A.. Krengel, L. E., & Kuczek, J. E., et al. (1998). Productivity of educational psychologists in educational psychology journals, 1991-1996. Contemporary Educational Psychology, 23,173-181]; [Smith, M. C., Plant, M., Carney, R. N., Arnold, C.

Contemporary Educational Psychology, 28,422-430.1) spanning the years 1991-2002. The present study updates this literature by examining the same five journals: Cognition and Instruction, Contemporary Educational Psychology, the Educational Psychologist, Educational Psychology Review, and the Journal of Educational Psychology from 2003 to 2008. Individual productivity was calculated by the number of (a) articles published and (b) points based on a formula that considers author position in relation to the number of authors. The University of Maryland and Richard E. Mayer maintained their positions as the top research institution and author, respectively. There was also growth in collaboration as well as international involvement as measured by number of authors. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved."
"As an emerging research direction in the field of systems and control, distributed control or decentralized control has attracted great interests of researchers in the past decade. In this paper, a bibliometric analysis of the relevant publications is presented based on the data collected from the Science Citation Index Expanded Web of Science. In particular, we make a discussion on the trend of total publications, journal distribution, top research organizations (i.e. universities and institutes), and publication performance of nations, and the focus is on highly cited articles and authors, subject categories, and the future trend of hot topics. Some key bibliometric indexes such as single country articles, first author articles, and internationally collaborative articles are employed to give us a detailed picture about the intrinsic relationship and the state of the art of distributed control publications. Finally, the statistical analysis indicates that multi-agent systems are extremely popular in recent years and will dominate the future research on distributed control."
"Hirsch's h index is becoming the standard measure of an individual's research accomplishments. The aggregation of individuals' measures is also the basis for global measures at institutional or national levels. To investigate whether the h index can be reliably computed through alternative sources of citation records, the Web of Science (WoS), PsycINFO and Google Scholar (GS) were used to collect citation records for known publications of four Spanish psychologists. Compared with WoS, PsycINFO included a larger percentage of publication records, whereas GS outperformed WoS and PsycINFO in this respect. Compared with WoS, PsycINFO retrieved a larger number of citations in unique areas of psychology, but it retrieved a smaller number of citations in areas that are close to statistics or the neurosciences, whereas GS retrieved the largest numbers of citations in all cases. Incorrect citations were scarce in Wos (0.3%), more prevalent in PsycINFO (1.1%), and overwhelming in GS (16.5%). All platforms retrieved unique citations, the largest set coming from GS. WoS and PsycINFO cover distinct areas of psychology unevenly, thus applying different penalties on the h index of researches working in different fields. Obtaining fair and accurate h indices required the union of citations retrieved by all three platforms."
"Background: Medical school graduates in Spain must take a uniform national exam (called ""examen MIR"") in order to enter postgraduate training in a specialty. Its results offer a unique opportunity to rank medical schools according to this exam. Objectives: We measured differences in the MIR exam results among Spanish medical schools and assessed the stability of the MIR-based rankings for the period 2003-2011. Results: In the year 2011 a total of 6873 residency positions nationwide were offered by the Spanish Ministry of Health, Social Services and Equality. These positions covered 47 specialties distributed over 231 training centers. A total of 11,550 medical graduates (including 1997 foreign graduates) took the MIR examination. Marked differences among medical schools were evident. The median graduate from medical school #1 and #29 occupied the positions 1477 and 5383, respectively. These figures correspond to a standardized ranking of 21 out of 100 for medical school #1 (that is, 1477/6873; half of medical school #1 obtained better [below position 21%] and half worse [over position 21%] results) and a standardized ranking of 70 out of 100 for medical school #29. While 81% of the medical school #1 graduates were amongst the best 3000 MIR exams and only 5% above the 5000 position the corresponding figures for medical school #29 graduates were 21% and 44%, respectively. The ranking position of the 29 medical schools was very stable between the years 2003 and 2011. Conclusion: There are marked differences in medical schools in Spain and these differences are very consistent over the years 2003-2011. (C) 2013 Elsevier Espana, S.L. All rights reserved."
"Author name ambiguity may occur when multiple authors share the same name or different name variations of a single author exist. This degrades search results and correct attributions in bibliographic databases. Existing solutions require either the actual number of ambiguous authors or extra information that is collected from the Web. However, in many scenarios, obtaining such auxiliary information is not possible or requires much extra effort. An effective and scalable method, ASONET, is proposed that uses graph community detection algorithms and graph operations to disambiguate namesakes. The citation dataset is preprocessed and ambiguous author blocks are formed. A graph structural clustering, gSkeletonClu, is applied to identify hubs, outliers, and clusters of nodes in a coauthor's graph. Namesakes are resolved by splitting these clusters across the hub if their feature vector similarity is less than a predefined threshold. ASONET utilizes only coauthors and titles that are surely available in all bibliographic databases. To validate the ASONET performance, experiments are performed on two real-world datasets of Arnetminer and DBLP. The results confirm that ASONET is scalable and outperforms baselines."
"The great importance international rankings have achieved in the research policy arena warns against many threats consequence of the flaws and shortcomings these tools present. One of them has to do with the inability to accurately represent national university systems as their original purpose is only to rank world-class universities. Another one has to do with the lack of representativeness of universities' disciplinary profiles as they usually provide a unique table. Although some rankings offer a great coverage and others offer league tables by fields, no international ranking does both. In order to surpass such limitation from a research policy viewpoint, this paper analyzes the possibility of using national rankings in order to complement international rankings. For this, we analyze the Spanish university system as a study case presenting the I-UGR Rankings for Spanish universities by fields and subfields. Then, we compare their results with those obtained by the Shanghai Ranking, the QS Ranking, the Leiden Ranking and the NTU Ranking, as they all have basic common grounds which allow such comparison. We conclude that it is advisable to use national rankings in order to complement international rankings, however we observe that this must be done with certain caution as they differ on the methodology employed as well as on the construction of the fields."
"In Brazil, scientific performance of researchers is one important criteria for decision-making in grant allocation. In this context, this study aimed to evaluate and compare the profile of 82 seniors' investigators (graded as level 1A-D) which were receiving CNPq (National Council for Scientific and Technological Development) productivity grant in Pharmacology, by analyzing the pattern of citation of their papers and h-index. Total documents, citations (with and without self-citations) and h-index (with and without self-citations) were retrieved from the Scopus database. The results indicated a clear difference among researchers from the higher categories (1A and 1B) in most of the parameters analyzed. However, no noticeable differentiation was found between researchers from grant category 1C and 1D. The results presented here may inform the scientific community and the grant agencies on the profile of PQ 1(A-D) fellows of Pharmacology, and may help to define new differences within CNPq grant categories, and consequently, a better allocation of grants."
"We investigated the extent to which different selection mechanisms for awarding scholarships varied in their short- and longer-term consequences in the performance of awardees in terms of scientific production. We conducted an impact evaluation study on undergraduate, master's, and PhD research scholarships and compared two different financial sources in Brazil: in one, the selection mechanism was based on a peer review system; the other was based on an institutional system other than peer review. Over 8,500 questionnaires were successfully completed, covering the period 1995-2009. The two groups were compared in terms of their scientific performance using a propensity score approach. We found that the peer-reviewed scholarship awardees showed better performance: they published more often and in journals with higher impact factors than scholarship awardees from the other group. However, two other results indicate a different situation. First, over the long-term, awardees under the peer review system continued to increase their publication rate and published in higher-quality journals; however, the differences with the control group tended to diminish after PhD graduation. Second, the better performance of peer-reviewed scholarships was not observed in all subject areas. The main policy implications of this study relate to a better understanding of selection mechanisms and the heterogeneity regarding the relation between selection processes and scientific and academic output."
"In 1983 I found that the most productive ages for research astronomers was 40-75 years, contradicting the frequent statement that a scientist's best work is done before the age of 35. Now most scientists work in small to large teams, unlike the individual research usually done previously. How has that affected the productive careers of astronomers? A new study of 14 recent Russell Lecturers shows a peak in productivity at age 33 and more than half that peak during 25-56 years, in agreement with results in other sciences. Nevertheless, 33% of their best work was done after the age of 50 years."
"Background: To investigate the characteristics of editors and criteria used by orthopaedic journal editors in assessing submitted manuscripts. Methods: Between 2008 to 2009 all 70 editors of Medline listed orthopaedic journals were approached prospectively with a questionnaire to determine the criteria used in assessing manuscripts for publication. Results: There was a 42% response rate. There was 1 female editor and the rest were male with 57% greater than 60 years of age. 67% of the editors worked in university teaching hospitals and 90% of publications were in English. The review process differed between journals with 59% using a review proforma, 52% reviewing an anonymised manuscript, 76% using a routine statistical review and 59% of journals used 2 reviewers routinely. In 89% of the editors surveyed, the editor was able to overrule the final decision of the reviewers. Important design factors considered for manuscript acceptance were that the study conclusions were justified (80%), that the statistical analysis was appropriate (76%), that the findings could change practice (72%). The level of evidence (70%) and type of study (62%) were deemed less important. When asked what factors were important in the manuscript influencing acceptance, 73% cited an understandable manuscript, 53% cited a well written manuscript and 50% a thorough literature review as very important factors. Conclusions: The editorial and review process in orthopaedic journals uses different approaches. There may be a risk of language bias among editors of orthopaedic journals with under-representation of non-English publications in the orthopaedic literature."
"A bibliometric evaluation was made of research performance in modern language and linguistics research. Separate analyses were made for language and linguistics and for literature components of each language in the study. The study covered both publications directed at a national or international scholarly output and publications destined for the general public. The latter accounted. for 8-73% of the output, and were particularly important in literature output. Publication and citation behavior differed considerably between language and linguistics on the one hand and literature on the other hand, calling for a tailored design of monitoring studies in both fields. In publications directed at scholars, the national language did not dominate. In literature fields, the language of the object of study was most important, while in language and linguistics, the object language was not always more important than English. The study indicates that both journal articles and book output need to be included in bibliometric evaluation. Citation impact analysis is shown to be informative in bibliometric assessment in this field, especially when a five-year citation window is used."
"Background: Shiraz University of Medical Sciences, Iran has developed a new version of health urban posts called Urban Community Health Center (UCHC) with primary aim of improving primary health care (PHC) in urban areas. The aim of present study was to evaluate this newly developed model of UCHC in Ghaleno, a suburban region of Shiraz, Iran in 2014. Methods: Besides descriptive analysis of foregoing model and considering its goal, plan, and dimensions, a qualitative study was carried out using in-depth interview with four managers of this model in Ghaleo region as well as the family physicians (FPs) of the model. Data were analyzed using conventional content analysis. Results: Evaluation of this model in 7-month period after implementation, showed that population coverage was raised from 23% to 84%, a remarkable and increasing achievement of 61%. The universal package is a protocol for providing healthcare services based on PHC. The descriptive study of the model based on physicians view, explored real FP, population's satisfaction, importance of physician's assistant, and payment system reform in the model. Conclusion: Ghaleno model has unique objectives in providing healthcare services in urban areas. The findings of this study call for further evaluation, specifically in quality care services. The success and continuation of this model demand the support of policy makers."
"The paper analyzes the concept of scientific institutionalization and its relationship with research in the context of the scientific production published in books, journal articles, book chapters and lectures in events outside Brazil, by Brazilian researchers registered at the Plataforma Lattes. A qualitative and diachronic analysis was performed by means of a survey on the publications in an attempt to analyze the evolution in the number of Brazilian documents published abroad, distribution of the publications both per country, author affiliation and type of document, in addition to authors' profiles. It is concluded that the analyzed studies have contributed for the acknowledgement of Brazilian researchers in Information Science (IS) in other countries and, as a consequence, there is a consolidation of the scientific institutionalization of this field in Brazil."
"The subject of our present paper is the analysis of the origins or historical roots of the Higgs boson research from a bibliometric perspective, using a segmented regression analysis in combination with a method named reference publication year spectroscopy (RPYS). Our analysis is based on the references cited in the Higgs boson publications published since 1974. The objective of our analysis consists of identifying specific individual publications in the Higgs boson research context to which the scientific community frequently had referred to. We are interested in seminal works which contributed to a high extent to the discovery of the Higgs boson. Our results show that researchers in the Higgs boson field preferably refer to more recently published papers - particularly papers published since the beginning of the sixties. For example, our analysis reveals seven major contributions which appeared within the sixties: Englert and Brout (1964), Higgs (1964, 2 papers), and Guralnik et al. (1964) on the Higgs mechanism as well as Glashow (1961), Weinberg (1967), and Salam (1968) on the unification of weak and electromagnetic interaction. Even if the Nobel Prize award highlights the outstanding importance of the work of Peter Higgs and Francois Englert, bibliometrics offer the additional possibility of getting hints to other publications in this research field (especially to historical publications), which are of vital importance from the expert point of view."
"This research note presents the results of a bibliometric analysis that was conducted to better understand the impact that Sustainable Forest Management Network (SFMN) funded research had in the forest-related social and Aboriginal research communities. We applied two indicators of research impact: (i) research outputs and (ii) citations. Our results suggest that the SFMN's research outputs were highest in the fields of economics, sociology, and political science and law. The number of research articles that acknowledged the SFMN was 30% of the total research output of the SFMN-funded Principal Investigators. These articles represented 3% of the social science articles published in the Forestry Chronicle (the journal most frequently used by SFMN-funded Principal Investigators). Research output related to Aboriginal forestry indicated that the SFMN had a significant influence on the development of the field. Our citation analysis indicated that the average number of citations per SFMN-acknowledged publication in the social sciences was approximately the same as the international impact standard in the field. These results suggest that the SFMN-funded research in the social sciences compared very well with the international research standards in forest-related social sciences."
"Objectives/Hypothesis: Assessment of scholarly productivity as measured by research output is a key component of decisions regarding appointment and advancement in academic otolaryngology. An increasing number of graduating residents are pursuing postresidency fellowships, and evaluation of research productivity among these subspecialists is important in determining their role in academic otolaryngology departments. The h-index is a reliable indicator of research productivity, as it takes into account both quantity and relevance of research contributions. Our objective was to evaluate and compare trends in research productivity among the various otolaryngology subspecialties. Study Design: Analysis of research productivity trends among otolaryngology subspecialties using the h-index. Methods: Faculty members from 92 academic otolaryngology departments were organized by subspecialty and academic rank, and their research productivity, as measured by the h-index, was calculated using the Scopus database. Results: Fellowship-trained otolaryngologists in academic programs had higher h-indices than nonfellowship-trained otolaryngologists. Head and neck surgeons and otologists had significantly higher research productivity than their peers in other otolaryngology subspecialties. Analysis of the subspecialties of chairpersons indicated that 62% were either head and neck surgeons or otologists. Conclusions: Fellowship-trained otolaryngologists had higher h-indices, and faculty members trained in the subspecialties with the highest research productivity were disproportionately represented in positions of leadership within academic otolaryngology, probably reflecting the importance of research contributions in the academic advancement process, although other factors, such as educational contributions and clinical performance, may also be important factors.

"Purpose: In this series of articles-Research Ethics I, Research Ethics II, and Research Ethics III-the authors provide a comprehensive review of the 9 core domains for the responsible conduct of research (RCR) as articulated by the Office of Research Integrity. In Research Ethics II, the authors review the RCR domains of mentoring, collaboration, peer review, and data management and ownership. Method: They relied on authoritative documents, both historical and contemporary, insightful commentary, and empirical research in order to identify current issues and controversies of potential interest to both faculty and students. Conclusions: The authors close by urging readers to stay abreast of the manifold ethics issues facing today's community of scientists, policymakers, and research institutions, and to adhere to best practices as they evolve."
"A recent paper (Canavero et al., 2014. Journal of the American Society for Information Science and Technology, doi:10.1109/TPC.2013.2255935) performed a bibliometric analysis of an extensive set of scientific journals within the Engineering field, published by IEEE (Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers). The analysis was based on (i) the citation impact of journal articles and (ii) the reputation of journal authors in terms of total scientific production and relevant citation impact. The goal of this paper is to complement the prior analysis, investigating on the different citation cultures of these journals, depending on the sub-field/specialty of interest. To perform this evaluation, it is suggested a novel technique, which takes into account the connections between journals and some highly specialized communities of scientists, known as IEEE Technical Societies and Councils. After showing significant differences in terms of propensity to cite, probably attributable to the large variety of sub-fields and specialties covered by IEEE journals, it is presented a simplified technique for the sub-field normalization of the results of the prior study. The main contribution of this work is (1) providing an empirical confirmation of the complexity of the problem of normalization, even for journals within the same field but different sub-fields/specialties, and (2) showing how the use of highly specialized information on a journal reference sub-field(s) may be helpful for improving the estimation of the journal propensity to cite. Description is supported by a large amount of empirical data. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."
"In this paper we show that assigning weights to the edges in a collaboration network of authors, according to a decreasing exponential function depending on the time elapsed since the publication of a common paper, may add valuable information to the process of ranking authors based on importance. The main idea is that a recent collaboration represents a stronger tie between the co-authors than an older one and, therefore, reduces the weight of potential citations between the co-authors. We test this approach, on a well-known data set and with an established methodology of using PageRank-based ranking techniques and reference sets of awarded authors and demonstrate that edge ageing may improve the ranking of authors."
"Finding relevant publications is important for scientists who have to cope with exponentially increasing numbers of scholarly material. Algorithms can help with this task as they help for music, movie, and product recommendations. However, we know little about the performance of these algorithms with scholarly material. Here, we develop an algorithm, and an accompanying Python library, that implements a recommendation system based on the content of articles. Design principles are to adapt to new content, provide near-real time suggestions, and be open source. We tested the library on 15K posters from the Society of Neuroscience Conference 2015. Human curated topics are used to cross validate parameters in the algorithm and produce a similarity metric that maximally correlates with human judgments. We show that our algorithm significantly outperformed suggestions based on keywords. The work presented here promises to make the exploration of scholarly material faster and more accurate."
"Background: Chairpersons of surgery departments are key stakeholders and role models and leaders of research in academic medical institutions. However, the characteristics of surgical chairpersons are understudied. This study aimed to investigate the association between the personal academic achievement of a surgical chairperson and the National Institutes of Health (NIH) funding of the department. Methods: We calculated the Hirsch index (H-index), a measure of research productivity, for chairpersons of surgery of the top 90 research medical schools that were ranked by U.S. News & World Report. Specialty training, y as chairperson, location, and NIH institutional and department funding were analyzed. Nonparametric tests and linear regression methods were used to compare the different groups. Results: Of the 90 chairpersons, 20 positions for chairs (22%) are either recent (< 1 y) or unfilled (n=6). Only 3% of all chairpersons are women, and the median H-index for the chairpersons is 20 (Interquartile range 14-27) with a median 101 publications with 14 cites per publication. Median surgery-specific NIH funding in 2011 was $ 1.7 million (Interquartile range $ 721,042-5,085,305). The chairperson's H-index was exponentially associated with department funding in multivariate models adjusting for institution rank, except when the H-index was extreme (< 4 or > 49) (coefficient 0.32, P=0.02). Conclusions: The research productivity of a chairperson is the only personal attribute of those studied that is associated with the departmental NIH funding. This suggests the important role an academically productive surgical leader may play as a champion for the academic success of the department. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved."
"Analyzes the dynamics of scientific production process from the perspective of philosophy, with the contribution of the sociology of science. Aims to conduct a meta-theoretical study of Scientific Collaboration, from the Dynamic Systems Theory and the Self-organization Theory. This paper also use the methodology about meta-theoretical analysis Mu by Ritzer and describes the science and scientific collaboration as from selected theories. Identifies the work in the intellectual-internal, social-domestic and foreign intellectual axes and points out that each area has different characteristics according to its domestic laws, consolidated from its historical development and social context. Considers that the groups of researchers form spontaneously and this researchers organize themselves to choose their colaborators. It also considers that science can be treated as an autonomous and self-organizing system that is built from their own results, and with the interaction with the social context in which it operates."
"The five Indian Institutes of Technology set up between 1951 and 1961 have established a great reputation for undergraduate engineering education, as good as and, in fact, better than most institutions in the world. But this achievement did not extend to postgraduate engineering education, particularly the training of Ph Ds leading to cited publications, exploitable patents, innovative products and entrepreneurship. An attempt is made here to analyse the reasons for this and suggest achievable, though tough, pathways."
"The scientific integrity, perceptions of scientific misconduct, and students' needs in the research ethics education of Korean and Japanese gifted students were analyzed to address three questions. First, how well do students practice research ethics in their research? Second, how do students perceive scientists' misconduct? Third, do students want to learn research ethics and what aspects do they want to learn? Participants comprised 397 Korean and 370 Japanese science gifted high school students. Survey results showed that 48.92% of Korean students and 14.86% of Japanese students experienced scientific misconduct regarding their research. However, 90.61% of Korean students and 87.54% of Japanese students could identify these behaviors are scientific misconducts. Only 32.94% of Korean students and 19.63% of Japanese students expressed a desire to learn about research ethics concepts and practical issues during research. Although professing knowledge about scientific integrity, their scientific misconduct demonstrates a lack of authentic understanding. Thus, there is a need to accurately present students with the training they need."
"In this review we investigate what the available data on the predictive validity of peer review can add to our understanding of judgmental forecasting. We found that peer review attests to the relative success of judgmental forecasting by experts. Both manuscript and group-based peer review allow, on average, for accurate decisions to be made. However, tension exists between peer review and innovative ideas, even though the latter underlie scientific advance. This points to the danger of biases and preconceptions in judgments. We therefore formulate two proposals for enhancing the likelihood of innovative work. (C) 2010 International Institute of Forecasters. Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."
"This paper addresses how countries placed a different intellectual focus on the management of technology and innovation (MOT) research in ten leading MOT specialty journals published in 2000-2009. The result confirms that each country has quite diverse relative research interests and performances in MOT domains. Among the top seven leading countries in MOT research, the US has a comparative advantage in project management (PJM); the UK has one in social change (SCH); and Spain has one in intellectual property (IPR). The other four countries show much more dynamic observations. Netherlands has clearly a comparative advantage in technology policy (TPO), while Taiwan has one in technology analysis and forecast (TAF), Germany in entrepreneurship (ENT), and Italy in technology transfer and commercialization (TTC). This paper contributes to the MOT community by providing much clearer evidence of how countries become differently positioned in the global MOT arena. These empirical findings demonstrate significant differences in the comparative competitiveness of countries involved in MOT research that were little known earlier. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

"We describe ongoing research where the aim is to apply recent results from the research field of information fusion to bibliometric analysis and information retrieval. We highlight the importance of 'uncertainty' within information fusion and argue that this concept is crucial also for bibliometrics and information retrieval. More specifically, we elaborate on three research strategies related to uncertainty: uncertainty management methods, explanation of uncertainty and visualization of uncertainty. We exemplify our strategies to the classical problem of author name disambiguation where we show how uncertainty can be modeled explained and visualized using information fusion. We show how an information seeker can benefit from tracing increases/decreases of uncertainty in the reasoning process. We also present how such changes can be explained for the information seeker through visualization techniques, which are employed to highlight the complexity involved in the process of modeling and managing uncertainty in bibliometric analysis. Finally we argue that a further integration of information fusion approaches in the research area of bibliometrics and information retrieval may results in new and fruitful venues of research."
"The objective of this article is to further the study of journal interdisciplinarity, or, more generally, knowledge integration at the level of individual articles. Interdisciplinarity is operationalized by the diversity of subject fields assigned to cited items in the article's reference list. Subject fields and subfields were obtained from the Leuven-Budapest (ECOOM) subject-classification scheme, while disciplinary diversity was measured taking variety, balance, and disparity into account. As diversity measure we use a Hill-type true diversity in the sense of Jost and Leinster-Cobbold. The analysis is conducted in 3 steps. In the first part, the properties of this measure are discussed, and, on the basis of these properties it is shown that the measure has the potential to serve as an indicator of interdisciplinarity. In the second part the applicability of this indicator is shown using selected journals from several research fields ranging from mathematics to social sciences. Finally, the often-heard argument, namely, that interdisciplinary research exhibits larger visibility and impact, is studied on the basis of these selected journals. Yet, as only 7 journals, representing a total of 15,757 articles, are studied, albeit chosen to cover a large range of interdisciplinarity, further research is still needed."
"Objective: To find out the frequency and type of English Grammar problems in original articles, submitted for publication in Annals of Abbasi Shaheed Hospital, Karachi. Study Design: A cross-sectional study. Place and Duration of Study: Department of Annals of Abbasi Shaheed Hospital and Karachi Medical and Dental College in January 2015. Methodology: The study evaluated 28 original research articles, published in Annals of Abbasi Shaheed Hospital and Karachi Medical and Dental College during January 2013 to December 2014, for the English language mistakes in the manuscripts. The researchers evaluated English grammar problems in the manuscripts and recorded the details on a predesigned proforma. The data was analysed on SPSS version 19.0. The categorical variables were computed as percentage. Results: It has been observed that all the manuscripts evaluated for English grammar mistakes, demonstrated language mistakes. The mean of mistakes in June 2014 was 14.6 +/- 2.26, while for December 2014 is 20.5 +/- 4.76. The mean for the year 2013 issues was 1 +/- 6.18 for June issue and 13.3 +/- 3.0 for December issue, respectively. The number of mistakes identified in the manuscripts in descending order included punctuation marks, use of inappropriate tense and voice, use of articles (a, an, the), use of prepositions, wordiness (excessive words), long sentences, spelling mistakes, flow of thought process, incomplete sentences, and frequent use of abbreviations. Conclusion: A large number of manuscripts revealed inappropriate use of punctuation marks followed by tenses, active and passive voices."
"Purpose: Citations received by papers published within a journal serve to increase its bibliometric impact. The objective of this paper was to assess the influence of publication language, article type, number of authors, and year of publication on the citations received by papers published in Gaceta Sanitaria, a Spanish-language journal of public health. Methods: The information sources were the journal website and the Web of Knowledge, of the Institute of Scientific Information. The period analyzed was from 2007 to 2010. We included original articles, brief original articles, and reviews published within that period. We extracted manually information regarding the variables analyzed and we also differentiated among total citations and self-citations. We constructed logistic regression models to analyze the probability of a Gaceta Sanitaria paper to be cited or not, taking into account the aforementioned independent variables. We also analyzed the probability of receiving citations from non-Spanish authors. Results: Two hundred forty papers fulfilled the inclusion criteria. The included papers received a total of 287 citations, which became 202 when excluding self-citations. The only variable influencing the probability of being cited was the publication year. After excluding never cited papers, time since publication and review papers had the highest probabilities of being cited. Papers in English and review articles had a higher probability of citation from non-Spanish authors. Conclusions: Publication language has no influence on the citations received by a national, non-English journal. Reviews in English have the highest probability of citation from abroad. Editors should decide how to manage this information when deciding policies to raise the bibliometric impact factor of their journals. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved."
"Background: Team science research includes the number of coauthors in publications. Many papers have discussed the ordering of author names and the contributions of authors to a paper. However, no paper addresses the relation between authors' research domains and personal impact factors (PIF) with the ordering of author names. We aimed to apply Gini coefficient (GC) to evaluate the author research domains associated with the PIF and the ordering of author names on academic papers. Methods: By searching the PubMed database (Pubmed. com), we used the keyword "" medicine"" [journal] and downloaded 10,854 articles published from 1969 to 2018. A total number of 7502 articles labeled with complete author's countries/areas were included in data analysis. We also proposed a PIF index and jointly applied social network analysis (SNA), the GC, and Google Maps to report the following data with visual representations: the trend of author collaboration in Medicine; the dominant nations and keywords in Medicine; and the author research domains in Medicine associated with the PIF and the ordering of author names on academic papers. Results: The trend of author collaboration in Medicine is slightly declining (= -0.06) based on the number of authors per article. The mean number of individuals listed as authors in articles is 7.5. Most first authors are from China (3649, 48.64%) and Taiwan (847, 11.29%). The median of GC (0.32) and PIF (0.74) for the middle authors are obviously less than those for the first (0.53, 2.19) and the last authors (0.42, 2.61). A perfect positive linear relation with a large effect exists between GC and PIF because the correlation coefficient is 0.68 (> 0.50, t= 2.48, n= 9). Conclusion: Results suggest that the corresponding author is submitting the manuscript to the target journal with a core author's academic background and the personal impact factor related to the research domain and the journal scope in the future. As such, peer reviewers can quickly determine whether the manuscript is a potentially citable research paper."
"Maturity model has been increasingly approached by several researchers from various research areas in order to develop models that could assess the strengths and weaknesses of a system and/or a process, and to develop scripts for improvement. Additionally, they pursue the development of a process with desirable goals, such as a set of resources or practices, resulting in a more mature organization or system. This study provides an overview of the maturity models' literature and their main features while employing bibliometric analyses of publications from 2004 through 2014 aiming to identify scientific gaps that would serve as guides for future research. The analyses' results reveal that maturity models are highly applied in project management seeking for processes and/or systems improvement, and they can also be described as adaptable models which could be used in various research areas, as can be seen in the scientific gaps section. Therefore, the main contribution of this paper is to make the evolution of this subject and its importance better known, thus encouraging the use of maturity model in future researches, seeking the improvement of the current model."
"This study analyzes the impact that publishing during the period of PhD study has on researchers' future knowledge production, impact, and co-authorship. The analysis is based on a representative sample of PhDs from all fields of science working in Portugal. For each researcher in the dataset, we compiled a lifetime publication record and respective meta-data retrieved from Thomson Reuters Web of Science. Our results extend the previous literature by showing that those who publish during their PhD have greater research production and productivity, and greater numbers of yearly citations and citations throughout their career compared to those who did not publish during their PhD. Moreover, it is found that those who publish during their PhD are more adept to publish single-authored publications and engage in publications with peers based abroad, thus suggesting both higher levels of scientific autonomy and international collaboration dynamics."
"This paper measures social media activities of 15 broad scientific disciplines indexed in Scopus database using Altmetric.com data. First, the presence of Altmetric.com data in Scopus database is investigated, overall and across disciplines. Second, a zero-truncated negative binomial model is used to determine the association of various factors with increasing or decreasing citations. Lastly, the effectiveness of altmetric indices to identify publications with high citation impact is comprehensively evaluated by deploying area under the curve (AUC)-an application of receiver operating characteristic. Results indicate a rapid increase in the presence of Altmetric.com data in Scopus database from 10.19% in 2011 to 20.46% in 2015. It was found that Blog count was the most important factor in the field of Health Professions and Nursing as it increased the number of citations by 38.6%, followed by Twitter count increasing the number of citations by 8% in the field of Physics and Astronomy. The results of receiver operating characteristic show that altmetric indices can be a good indicator to discriminate highly cited publications, with an encouragingly AUC = 0.725 between highly cited publications and total altmetric count. Overall, findings suggest that altmetrics can be used to distinguish highly cited publications. The implications of this research are significant in many different directions. Firstly, they set the basis for a further investigation of altmetrics efficiency to predict publications impact and most significantly promote new insights for the measurement of research outcome dissemination over social media."
"Professors in small departments do carry out research, and they can sene an important role in inspiring and preparing under graduate students for graduate school. Although normative data of research productivity and impact of professors in Canadian psychology graduate departments have been reported, no normative data are available for professors in departments that offer undergraduate programmes only. Such normative data would provide a fuller picture of research productivity in academic psychology in Canada and help students in small departments identify mentors. In the present study, normative data of research productivity and impact for 165 professors in 14 Canadian psychology departments that offer only under graduate programmes were provided through an analysis of data from publicly available databases. The results show that these professors (excluding 5 outliers) had a mean of 11.74 career-to-date peer-reviewed journal articles (M-d = 9), 268 citations (M-d = 130), and an h-index of 6.30 (M-d = 5), and there were great variations on all measures. Most significant was that research field had significant effects on number of career-to-date publications and h-index, but research field was no longer a significant factor for the number of publications at then current institutions As expected, there was a significant mam effect of academic tank (p < .05) but no significant differences in productivity and impact between men and women. Limitations of using such archival data and implications of the findings for professors and students in undergraduate programmes are discussed."
"Systematic reviews of scientific literature are important for mapping the existing state of research and highlighting further growth channels in a field of study, but systematic reviews are inherently tedious, time consuming, and manual in nature. In recent years, keyword cooccurrence networks (KCNs) are exploited for knowledge mapping. In a KCN, each keyword is represented as a node and each co-occurrence of a pair of words is represented as a link. The number of times that a pair of words co-occurs in multiple articles constitutes the weight of the link connecting the pair. The network constructed in this manner represents cumulative knowledge of a domain and helps to uncover meaningful knowledge components and insights based on the patterns and strength of links between keywords that appear in the literature. In this work, we propose a KCN-based approach that can be implemented prior to undertaking a systematic review to guide and accelerate the review process. The novelty of this method lies in the new metrics used for statistical analysis of a KCN that differ from those typically used for KCN analysis. The approach is demonstrated through its application to nano-related Environmental, Health, and Safety (EHS) risk literature. The KCN approach identified the knowledge components, knowledge structure, and research trends that match with those discovered through a traditional systematic review of the nanoEHS field. Because KCN-based analyses can be conducted more quickly to explore a vast amount of literature, this method can provide a knowledge map and insights prior to undertaking a rigorous traditional systematic review. This two-step approach can significantly reduce the effort and time required for a traditional systematic literature review. The proposed KCN-based pre-systematic review method is universal. It can be applied to any scientific field of study to prepare a knowledge map."
"The aim of this study was to analyze the Research Projects I+D+i financed by the National Plan in the area of psychology and management in the area of Sport Management, as well as granted by the Sports Council. Thiswas recorded on the website of the Ministry of Innovation and Science projects related to sports science (n = 155) and those associated with psychology (n = 646). In addition there were projects awarded by the National Sports Council (CSD) (n = 203). From each of the approved projects have analyzed the following variables: year of the grant, gender researcher, principal investigator name, Region, University or agency, the grant amount,project type, project mode of Psychology sport and type of sample projects of Sport Psychology. The results indicate that the grant is much larger project of Sport Psychology in the ""Plan Nacional"" managed within the area of sport management and the Sports Council, that are managed within the management area of psychology, and well in all of them is much higher percentage of men than women as principal investigator. The regions of Cataluna, Valencia, Andalucia and Extremadura are spread over 70% of the approved projects in Sport Psychology. Among the Autonomous University of Barcelona, the University of Extremadura and the University orValencia are distributed over a third of all projects of Sport Psychology. The Psychology of Sport mode with more projects is the Health and Quality of Life, followed Motivation and Emotion and Psychobiology of Sport."
"Global industrialization is accelerated under the driving force of developing countries' rapid economic development. Water pollution is inevitably worsened due to lagging investment in basic treatment infrastructure. Wastewater treatment cannot rely on just one treatment technique, so research in this field has attracted much attention to satisfy stringent recovery and emissions standards increasingly imposed on industrial wastewater. This case study is a bibliometric analysis conducted to evaluate industrial wastewater treatment research from 1991 to 2014, based on the Science Citation Index Expanded (SCIE) database. Journal of Chemical Technology and Biotechnology is the leading journal in this field, publishing 3.8 % of articles over this period, followed by Journal of Hazardous Materials and Water Research, the latter of which has the highest impact factor and h-index of all journals in this field. India and the Chinese Academy of Sciences were the most productive country and institution, respectively, while the USA, was the most internationally collaborative and had the highest h-index (82) of all countries. A new method named ""word cluster analysis"" was successfully applied to trace the research hotspots. Innovation in treatment methods is thought to relate to the growth in volume and increase in complexity of industrial wastewater, as well as to policy decisions in developing countries that encourage effective industrial wastewater treatment."
"Author self-citation is a practice that has been historically surrounded by controversy. Although the prevalence of self-citations in different scientific fields has been thoroughly analysed, there is a lack of large scale quantitative research focusing on its usefulness at guiding readers in finding new relevant scientific knowledge. In this work we empirically address this issue. Using as our main corpus the entire set of PLOS journals research articles, we train a topic discovery model able to capture semantic dissimilarity between pairs of articles. By dividing pairs of articles involved in intra-PLOS citations into self-citations (articles linked by a cite which share at least one author) and non-self-citations (articles linked by a cite which share no author), we observe the distribution of semantic dissimilarity between citing and cited papers in both groups. We find that the typical semantic distance between articles involved in self-citations is significantly smaller than the observed one for articles involved in non-self-citations. Additionally, we find that our results are not driven by the fact that authors tend to specialize in particular areas of research, make use of specific research methodologies or simply have particular styles of writing. Overall, assuming shared content as an indicator of relevance and pertinence of citations, our results indicate that self-citations are, in general, useful as a mechanism of knowledge diffusion."
"The large amount of information contained in bibliographic databases has recently boosted the use of citations, and other indicators based on citation numbers, as tools for the quantitative assessment of scientific research. Citations counts are often interpreted as proxies for the scientific influence of papers, journals, scholars, and institutions. However, a rigorous and scientifically grounded methodology for a correct use of citation counts is still missing. In particular, cross-disciplinary comparisons in terms of raw citation counts systematically favors scientific disciplines with higher citation and publication rates. Here we perform an exhaustive study of the citation patterns of millions of papers, and derive a simple transformation of citation counts able to suppress the disproportionate citation counts among scientific domains. We find that the transformation is well described by a power-law function, and that the parameter values of the transformation are typical features of each scientific discipline. Universal properties of citation patterns descend therefore from the fact that citation distributions for papers in a specific field are all part of the same family of univariate distributions."
"This article presents an overview of the evolution of research activities at the Instituto Clodomiro Picado (ICP; University of Costa Rica), as reflected by its scientific publications during 40 years (1970-2010) since its foundation. The total production of publications in journals (442 articles) was compiled and an analysis was carried out of their characteristics such as subject areas, citation figures in the Web of Science, proportion of collaboration with foreign authors, countries involved in the collaborations, and utilization of local or international journals. The data indicate that research activities at ICP, from the perspective of the production of papers in journals, present a considerable development, consolidation and visibility. These analyses support the conclusion that it is feasible to produce science in a socioeconomic context such as that of Costa Rica, where resources to foster research are scarce and inconstant. Some of the factors that may have favored such quantitative and qualitative growth are discussed. The study of ICP as a particular case could provide information of a more general interest to formulate strategies for development in other groups or countries with similar characteristics."
"The ThomsonReuters impact factor is a viable, widely used and informative measure of journal visibility and frequency of use. It is accurate, transparent and easy to use. It is a live and evolving system, that can broaden its scope and implement new features and methods. Some of Vanclay's suggestions, like wider use of order statistics, or our suggestion of rank normalization might be implemented by JCR in the future."
"This study investigates the extent to which a gender gap exists in the citation rates of management researchers. Based on a cross-sectional sample of 26,783 publications and 65,436 authorships, we illuminate possible differences in women's and men's average citation impact per paper, adjusting for covariation attributable to geographical setting, institutional reputation, self-citations, collaborative patterns and journal prestige. We find a marginal difference in citation impact in favor of women management scholars. Women are also slightly more likely than men to author articles among the top-10% most cited in their field. Yet given the sensitivity of our results to uncertainties in the data, these variations should not be overgeneralized. In the large picture, differences in citation rates appear to be a negligible factor in the reproduction of gender inequalities in management research. (c) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."
"Both end users and authors commonly evaluate scientific journals based on several popular journal metrics. Such metrics, in particular the ""impact factor,"" carry crucial weight in terms of which journals authors choose for submitting scientific works as well as to what titles an institutional library subscribes. While previous research has focused on the value of journals in terms of ""price per page,"" no study has investigated the relationship between common journal metrics and the price a journal advertises for an annual subscription. In the present study, we took a linear modeling approach using Akaike information criterion to determine which journal metric (impact factor, Eigenfactor score, article influence score, total cites, or proportion reviews) was the ""best"" predictor of the advertised annual subscription price for scientific journals. Examining three differing scientific fields (aquatic science, sociology, and immunology) and accounting for for-profit versus not-for-profit status, we found results to be field-dependent. Total cites was the best predicting metric for the annual advertised subscription price for aquatic science and immunology, while the Eigenfactor score was the best predictor for sociology. We hypothesize the relationship with price changes with differing magnitudes of citation flows in a field. Clear from our study was that no single measure of journal quality is universally applicable to determine subscription ""value.""."
"Editors of peer-reviewed journals obtain recommendations from peer reviewers as guidance in deciding upon the suitability of a submitted manuscript for publication. To investigate whether the number of reviewers used by an editor affects the rate at which manuscripts are rejected, 500 manuscripts submitted to Monthly Weather Review during 15.5 months in 2007-2008 were examined. Two and three reviewers were used for 306 and 155 manuscripts, respectively (92.2% of all manuscripts). Rejection rates for initial decisions and final decisions were not significantly different whether two or three reviewers were used. Manuscripts with more reviewers did not spend more rounds in review or have different rejection rates at each round. The results varied by editor, however, with some editors rejecting more two-reviewer manuscripts and others rejecting more three-reviewer manuscripts. Editors described using their scientific expertise in the decision-making process, either in determining the number of reviews to be sought or in making decisions once the reviews were received, approaches that differ from that of relying purely upon reviewer agreement as reported previously in the literature. A simple model is constructed for three decision-making strategies for editors: rejection when all reviewers recommend rejection, rejection when any reviewer recommends rejection, and rejection when a majority of reviewers recommend rejection. By plotting the probability of reviewer rejection against the probability of editor rejection, the decision-making process can be graphically illustrated, demonstrating that, for this dataset, editors are likely to reject a manuscript when any reviewer recommends rejection."
"Keyword analysis has been an important research theme in bibliometrics. The deduction of new valuable bibliometric indicators/approaches through keyword analysis is important for prompting the further development of this subject area. In this study, the following three bibliometric indicators/approaches were thus derived. Indicator K was derived using the ratio between the average unique keyword number and average keyword frequency of a discipline for quantitatively describing the discipline's development stages highlighted by scientific-philosopher Kuhn. Next, the correlation matrix analysis was used after k-core filtration to quantitatively expose the detailed correlations between topics for a large network. Thirdly, indicators I (node betweenness divided by node degree) and C (clustering coefficient) were collectively introduced to predict potential growth keywords. Diverse topical evolutions were categorized into a strategic diagram according to the tendencies of I and C. With sustainable development as a case study, we verified that the three new bibliometric indicators/approaches work well and can realize many new concepts beyond the scope of available indicators or approaches. In summary, the present paper makes a renewed effort to promote the development of bibliometrics. We hope our work could catalyze the further studies from the communities in the scientometric fields."
"This study aimed to assess the impact of the Gross Domestic Product (GDP), spending on Research and Development (R&D), the number of universities and scientific journals on the published research documents, citable documents, citations per document and H-index in environmental sciences in the Middle East countries. All the 16 Middle East countries were included in the study. Information regarding the GDP, spending on R&D, the total number of universities and indexed journals was collected. Total number of research documents (papers), citable documents, citations per document and H-index in environmental sciences during the period 1996-2011 was recorded. The study used the World Bank, SCI-mago/Scopus, Web of Science, Journal Citation Reports (Thomson Reuters) as the main sources of information. The mean GDP per capita of all the Middle East countries amounted to 18 125.49 +/- 5386.28 US$, spending on R&D was 0.63 +/- 0.28 US$, the number of universities equaled 36.56 +/- 11.33 and mean ISI indexed journals amounted to 8.25 +/- 3.93. The mean number of research documents published in environmental sciences in the Middle East countries during the period 1996-2011 was 2202.12 +/- 883.98; citable documents: 2156.87 +/- 865.09; citations per document: 8.74 +/- 0.73; and the H-index: 35.37 +/- 6.17. There was a positive correlation between the money spent on R&D and citations per documents (r = 0.6, p = 0.01), H-Index (r = 0.6, p = 0.01); the number of universities and a total of research documents (r = 0.65, p = 0.006), citable documents (r = 0.65, p = 0.006), H-Index (r = 0.50, p = 0.04), as well as ISI indexed journals and total research documents (r = 0.94, p = 0.0001), citable documents (r = 0.94, p = 0.0001), H-Index (r = 0.73, p = 0.001). The Middle East countries which spend more on R&D and which have a large number of universities and ISI indexed journals are likely to produce more significant volume of research papers in the field of environmental science."

Peer-review of manuscripts submitted for publication in a scholarly journal is a cornerstone of the scientific process. Most scholars receive little or no training on how to conduct this key component of academic citizenship. This article provides guidance on a systematic approach to performing peer-review.
"The European Union (EU) seems to presume that the mass production of European research papers indicates that Europe is a leading scientific power, and the so-called European paradox of strong science but weak technology is due to inefficiencies in the utilization of this top level European science by European industry. We fundamentally disagree, and will show that Europe lags far behind the USA in the production of important, highly cited research. We will show that there is a consistent weakening of European science as one ascends the citation scale, with the EU almost twice as effective in the production of minimal impact papers, while the USA is at least twice as effective in the production of very highly cited scientific papers, and garnering Nobel prizes. Only in the highly multinational, collaborative fields of Physics and Clinical Medicine does the EU seem to approach the USA in top scale impact."
"Many journals seek to evaluate the quality of reviews performed by their panel of reviewers. The purpose of this study is to determine if members of a journal editorial board can consistently and reliably use a single numeric scoring system to evaluate the quality of peer reviews. A retrospective analysis of 11 randomly selected manuscripts that had undergone external peer review by three reviewers was performed. Six had been rejected and five accepted. Each deputy editor was asked to score each of the reviews. The intraclass correlation was determined for each of the manuscripts to determine the consistency in grading. The intraclass correlation for 10 of the 11 manuscripts was above 0.87. This study demonstrates that an editorial board of deputy editors, without external training, can consistently and reliably grade reviews with excellent agreement."
"A position paper (PP) should establish a unified voice in areas where controversy occurs based upon multiple practices and/or therapeutic choices. Typically, a position paper should elucidate the knowledge gap, followed by an evidence-based review of options, leading to an ""endorsed position."" A position paper should represent more than the opinion or consensus of the authors but should present current opinions and practices supported by the World Society of Emergency Surgery (WSES). Accordingly, position papers should require the approval of an expert group of WSES and in parallel be presented at an annual meeting prior to submission for publication. It is important that a unified approach for drafting of position papers be established and endorsed by WSES in order to establish credibility and prevent misunderstandings during a smooth transition to publication. The purpose of this article is to suggest a uniform process for the development of WSES guidelines."
"This research seeks to expand the body of knowledge surrounding International Open Access Week (OA Week) practices among small to medium-sized U.S. institutions, examining the rationales guiding these, and creating a baseline activity inventory which may be elaborated upon as open access continues to evolve and as OA Week matures beyond its fifth (2013) anniversary. An electronic survey with closed- and open-ended questions was used to collect data, which were analyzed for recurring themes. Of respondents whose campuses did observe OA Week, the most reported reason for doing so was related to supporting the library's educational outreach program; fewer respondents cited the library's philosophical commitment to open access. Lack of time was the most frequently given reason for OA Week non-participation, however around one quarter of non-participating respondents reported that they were unaware of OA Week, and another quarter reported that it did not figure in their strategic plan. The conditions that were found to best support celebrating OA Week included a grasp of the principles guiding OA on the part of at least one librarian, reinforced by: the educational mission of the library; adequate personnel; and sufficient time for planning. This exploratory study yields points for library- and self-assessment. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved."
"Portfolio analysis of the publication profile of a unit of interest, ranging from individuals and organizations to a scientific field or interdisciplinary programs, aims to inform analysts and decision makers about the position of the unit, where it has been, and where it may go in a complex adaptive environment. A portfolio analysis may aim to identify the gap between the current position of an organization and a goal that it intends to achieve or identify competencies of multiple institutions. We introduce a new visual analytic method for analyzing, comparing, and contrasting characteristics of publication portfolios. The new method introduces a novel design of dual-map thematic overlays on global maps of science. Each publication portfolio can be added as one layer of dual-map overlays over 2 related, but distinct, global maps of science: one for citing journals and the other for cited journals. We demonstrate how the new design facilitates a portfolio analysis in terms of patterns emerging from the distributions of citation threads and the dynamics of trajectories as a function of space and time. We first demonstrate the analysis of portfolios defined on a single source article. Then we contrast publication portfolios of multiple comparable units of interest; namely, colleges in universities and corporate research organizations. We also include examples of overlays of scientific fields. We expect that our method will provide new insights to portfolio analysis."
"The Institute for Scientific Information (ISI) defines substantive articles as source items, which include only research and review (R&R) articles. This policy encourages some Journals to publish a significant number of original reports in the category of letters to the editor and reviews in the category of Editorials. Consequently, the Impact Factor (IF) fails to provide a fair comparison between medical journals. We introduce a new value, the Comprehensive Citation Factor (CCF), which would include in the denominator all original reports and review articles. We reassessed the 2007 ISI IF rankings of 39 dermatology journals using the CCF formula. Along with research and review articles, research letters, editorials and case reports were also included in the denominator value. The CCF was calculated for each journal and then compared with the IF provided by the ISI for 2007. The rank orders of 27/39 journals (69%) were altered by two or more places bi-directionally. Journals with a significant number of editorial and/or letters had a lower CCF. Only 4 of the 39 journals (10%) kept the same rank when evaluated with the new CCF formula. The CCF is a more accurate quantitative representation to use for individual journal comparison. This formula would encourage editors to publish more manuscripts as original or review articles, rather letters or editorials, and eliminate the need for the controversial subjective classification."
"The recommendations, during the past 20 years, to improve PhD scientific training and graduate school success, have focused on the significance of mentoring. It is well established that PhD students with mentors have significantly more success in graduate school as demonstrated by publishing papers before they graduate and by making presentations. Have faculty and academic institutions embraced the mentoring role? This study explores the views of 3,500 scientists who have primary responsibilities to educate PhD and MD/PhD students. Faculty members report they are more likely to prefer being viewed as advisors (54 %) than mentors (38 %). Through an examination of perceptions about specific responsibilities of advisors and mentors, faculty members provide a description of their culture and the expectations they have about themselves and others. One would expect that because mentoring requires additional time and involvement that faculty would report differences between advising and mentoring. However, faculty members perceive few differences between advisors and mentors. We examine the implications of these findings. Future scientists need to be confident their education includes the opportunity to acquire the best possible research skills. To develop advisors who have the ability to provide this training, the process begins by defining role expectations and responsibilities and preparing advisors to interact with doctoral students in ways comparable to mentors. We expect faculty members to know how to teach and how to mentor; yet, we rarely discuss how to develop and shape the necessary skills of advisors so, that they more closely resemble those of mentors."
"This study had three objectives: to examine patterns of research collaboration in Ghana, to study reasons why Ghanaian-affiliated researchers collaborate with others (both inside and outside Ghana), and to determine the roles of Ghanaian-affiliated researchers in collaborations. The methodology comprised a bibliometric analysis of articles in the Web of Science for the years 1990 to 2013, and an online survey of 190 Ghanaian-affiliated corresponding authors of articles. Collaboration increased from 73% in 1990-1997 to 93% in 2006-2013, and international collaboration from 49 to 73% over the same time. The public university and government sectors, together with the three most research-productive organisations in each sector, were found to be highly dependent on collaboration for research production. The online survey revealed that collaboration with researchers in three regions (within Ghana, within the rest of Africa, and outside Africa) was to a large extent initiated by existing personal/working relationships. Access to expertise and enhanced productivity were the main reasons why Ghanaian-affiliated researchers collaborated with others in these three regions. Collaborators within Ghana were largely involved in the collection of data or fieldwork. Collaborators from outside Africa played instrumental roles in providing resources and securing research funds."
"The validity of academic knowledge largely rests on the reviewing procedures employed in scholarly publishing that shape and produce it. Drawing on fieldwork and in-depth interviews with journal editors and researchers, the paper aims to give an account of the rise of anonymous review among communication journals in mainland China, which has been modeled after western (especially the US) practice and added to, instead of replacing, the existing editor-leading three-stage reviewing approach. The paper examines the way by which journals articulate the 'international convention,' the negotiation between the emerging practice and the old institutional environment, and its implication for the legitimacy of journal publication. This paper contends that the cross-societal imitation of anonymous (peer) review is an attempt to obtain procedural legitimacy when the official legitimacy falls into crisis. Ideally, it functions as a 'strategic ritual' which lays a general foundation for journal organizations to claim credibility and provides resources for gatekeepers to defend their cultural authority and shield them against criticism or unfavorable requests. But in reality, the extent of adoption and implementation of anonymous review is largely restricted and reconfigured by the real institutional environment (i.e., the danwei system) in which it takes shape."
"Each co-author (CA) of any scientist can be given a rank of importance according to the number of joint publications which the authors have together. In this paper, the Zipf-Mandelbrot-Pareto law, i.e. is shown to reproduce the empirical relationship between and and shown to be preferable to a mere power law, . The CA core value, i.e. the core number of CAs, is unaffected, of course. The demonstration is made on data for two authors, with a high number of joint publications, recently considered by Bougrine (Scientometrics, 98(2): 1047-1064, 2014) and for seven authors, distinguishing between their ""journal"" and ""proceedings"" publications as suggested by Miskiewicz (Physica A, 392(20), 5119-5131, 2013). The rank-size statistics is discussed and the and exponents are compared. The correlation coefficient is much improved (0.99, instead of 0.92). There are marked deviations of such a co-authorship popularity law depending on sub-fields. On one hand, this suggests an interpretation of the parameter . On the other hand, it suggests a novel model on the (likely time dependent) structural and publishing properties of research teams. Thus, one can propose a scenario for how a research team is formed and grows. This is based on a hierarchy utility concept, justifying the empirical Zipf-Mandelbrot-Pareto law, assuming a simple form for the CA publication/cost ratio, . In conclusion, such a law and model can suggest practical applications on measures of research teams. In Appendices, the frequency-size cumulative distribution function is discussed for two sub-fields, with other technicalities."
"This paper studies the so-called abnormal phenomenon of delayed recognition in bibliometrics and focuses on the first step in quantitatively measuring this phenomenon. As bibliometric analysis of a paper's recognition and influence is an uncertain and extended process, proper calculation of delayed recognition and ""sleeping beauty"" publications has limitations in current scientometric studies, such as restricted application indicators, scope, and complex calculation methods. This study suggests a solution for depicting the citation delay phenomenon of individual papers that avoids dividing them into different periods, is applicable to all papers with various types of citation curves, and is easy to calculate. Notably, this approach advocates using an uneven weighted summation based on earlier and later citation years when analyzing an individual paper's citation data. It demonstrates that the intrinsic relation between two independent indicators of citation delay and Gs index is based on the same logic of applying uneven weights to sum up yearly citations. This paper also recommends that simultaneous application of the new indicator D-a and final citation numbers can efficiently identify those delayed recognition papers, and that the criterion for selecting papers can be adjusted by the value of a.

"Many journals post accepted articles online before they are formally published in an issue. Early citation impact evidence for these articles could be helpful for timely research evaluation and to identify potentially important articles that quickly attract many citations. This article investigates whether Microsoft Academic can help with this task. For over 65,000 Scopus in-press articles from 2016 and 2017 across 26 fields, Microsoft Academic found 2-5 times as many citations as Scopus, depending on year and field. From manual checks of 1122 Microsoft Academic citations not found in Scopus, Microsoft Academic's citation indexing was faster but not much wider than Scopus for journals. It achieved this by associating citations to preprints with their subsequent in-press versions and by extracting citations from in-press articles. In some fields its coverage of scholarly digital libraries, such as arXiv.org, was also an advantage. Thus, Microsoft Academic seems to be a more comprehensive automatic source of citation counts for in-press articles than Scopus. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."
"This study investigated the characteristics of multi-institutional authors and the academic impact of their articles in the fields of genetics and high-energy physics. The findings showed that the percentage of articles written by multi-institutional authors (87.3%) and the percentage of multi-institutional authors (27.8%) in genetics were higher than those (50.4% articles and 17.1% authors) in high-energy physics. Increasing trends were observed in the annual percentages of multi-institutional authors and their articles between 2008 and 2013 in both fields. Most multi-institutional authors were affiliated with two institutions. However, most multi-institutional authors in genetics were affiliated with two or more universities, whereas most multi-institutional authors in high-energy physics were affiliated with at least one university and one research institution. The academic impact of articles by multi-institutional authors was observed to be greater than that of other articles in high-energy physics (12.6 vs. 7.62 mean citations per article), and the opposite was observed in genetics (73.14 vs. 75.63 mean citations per article).

"The most obvious difference in science publishing between then' and now' is the dramatic change in the communication of data and in their interpretation. The democratization of science via the Internet has brought not only benefits but also challenges to publishing including fraudulent behavior and plagiarism, data and statistics reporting standards, authorship confirmation and other issues which affect authors, readers, and publishers in different ways. The wide accessibility of data on a global scale permits acquisition and meta-analysis to mine for novel synergies, and has created a highly commercialized environment. As we illustrate here, identifying unacceptable practices leads to changes in the standards for data reporting. ."
"The goal of this work is to analyse the production of reviews published between 2007 and 2009 in the scholarly journals in the Social Sciences and Humanities contained in the ISOC database. Different aspects were analysed: time pattern, journals, authorship and author affiliation. Also examined were the books reviewed, by publication type, language, authorship, publisher and time lag between the books' publication and the appearance of the reviews. The results concerning the reviews show a constant reduction in their production and a large number concentrated in the humanities. Authors are mostly Spaniards and university lecturers, who publish alone and have a very low level of productivity. There is also a high level of endogamy among those authors who are members of editorial boards. The results concerning the reviewed books reveal that few titles were reviewed more than once, there are a large number of monographs, mostly in Spanish, and there is a long time lag between a book's publication and the appearance of its review."
"Books are an important source of knowledge to disseminate information. Researchers and academicians write books to propagate their innovative research or teachings amongst academic as well as non-academic audience. The number of books written every year is increasing rapidly. According to International Publisher Association (IPA) annual report 2015-2016, around 150 million different books were published worldwide in 2014-2015. Many e-commerce websites are also involved in selling books. A recent addition to book publishing world is e-books, which have really made it very simple to publish. While, availability of large number of books is good for readers, at the same time it is challenging to find a good book, particularly in scholarly settings. Researchers in the area of Scientometrics have attempted to view assessment of goodness of a scholarly book by measuring citations that a book receive. However, citations alone are not a true measure of a book's impact. Many a times people use the knowledge in a book without actually citing it. Also use of books in classroom settings or for general reading often is not reflected in terms of citations. Therefore, it is important to obtain users's opinion about a book from other forms of data. Fortunately, we have now some data of this sort available in form of reviews, downloads and social media mentions etc. Amazon and Goodreads, both of which provide the readers' views about a book, are two good examples. This paper presents an exploratory research work on using these non-traditional data about books to assess impact of a book. A set of Scopus-indexed computer science books with good citations as well as some other popular books in computer science domain are used for analysis. The reviews of books have been crawled in an automated fashion from Amazon and Goodreads. Thereafter sentiment analysis is carried out the text of reviews. Results of sentiment analysis are compared and correlated with traditional impact assessment metrics. The experimental analysis does not show a coherent relationship between citation and online reviews. Also, majority of the online reviews are found to be positive for large number of books in the dataset. As a related exercise, the Scopus citation data and Google scholar citation data for books are also compared. A high value of correlation is observed in these two. Overall the exploratory analysis provides a useful insight into the problem of book impact assessment."
"Journal impact factor (JIF) is defined as the number of citations within a given year to items published by a journal in the preceding two years, divided by the number of citable items published by the journal during those two years. However, the 'citable documents' include only articles and reviews, and the 'non-citable documents' (NCDs) actually can be and are often cited, and some may have higher citations. Here we explore the cited characteristics of NCDs and their contributions to JIF. All data were taken from the Web of Science database. The results showed that 315,017 NCDs (including editorials, letters, reprints, news items, corrections, biographical items, and book reviews) could be retrieved from 2012 to 2013. There were 160,580 editorials and 81,652 letters with the respective citations of 98,434 and 40,692 in 2014; the citations per item were 0.613 and 0.498 respectively. The contributions of these two types of NCDs to JIF are obvious. Of the 64 journals with NCDs >= 500 or NCDs >= 10 while the citations >= 20, 19 showed contributions of NCDs to more than 20%. Although some journals publish more NCDs, their contributions to JIF are not obvious; only for a few journals are the NCDs contributions to JIF higher. These are mainly medical journals."
"IntroductionMadrid's CNIO (Spanish National Oncological Research Center) ranks among the three first institutions in the world, specifically dedicated to cancer research. CNIO research mainly focuses on three aspects: use of stem cells to fix problematic cancer damage, searches for genes that cause cancer disease, and use of drug design to manage oncological disorders.ObjectivesThe main goal of this study is to determine the effectiveness of the translation' of basic discoveries generated at this cancer research center, into new interventions aimed at preventing and treating various types of cancer, with bibliometric criteria.MethodsA corpus of published articles and citations received by CNIO between 1998 and 2016 has been retrieved from the Web of Science (WoS) database. Bibliometric indicators considered here are: citation practices, use of journals on the basis of their impact factors, scientific literature citing CNIO publications, and international connectedness of CNIO researchers.ResultsA total of 3510 articles were published by CNIO between 1998 and 2016, 23% of which in journals with impact factors between 10 and 15 and above 15. Along the same period, the institution received 135,769 citations published in more than 5800 journals, where the most important citing journals were the Plos One with 3.6% of all the citing articles, Oncotarget with 1.8%, and Scientific Reports with 1.2%. The highest number of citations was 18,005 in 2007; in terms of average citation rate, the first ranked CNIO research program was in the area of experimental therapeutics (77.79%), followed by molecular oncology (68.1%). This position was provided by the active growth in citation to the articles whose themes are related to the problems of the consequences of the design of preclinical drug candidates and the study of oncological disorders.ConclusionsFrom this study on a number of bibliometric characteristics of the Spanish National Oncological Research Center (CNIO), we conclude that the publication activity (since 2006 its scientific production has increased in about 83%), the number of high-quality journals used per year, the high influence, and impact of the journals and organizations citing the institution, consolidate its image as a top-notch oncological research center."
"This paper investigates the determinants of professors' career advancement in Italian universities. From the analyses, it emerges that the fundamental determinant of an academic candidate's success is not scientific merit, but rather the number of years that the candidate has belonged to the same university as the president of the selection committee. Where applicants have participated in research work with the president, their probability of success also increases significantly. The factors of the years of service and occurrence of joint research with other members of the commission also have an effect, however, that carries less weight. Nepotism, although it exists, seems less important. The scientific quality of the members of the commission has a negligible effect on the expected outcome of the competition, and even less so the geographical location of the university holding the competition."
"Disability is an identity, a culture/community/cause/power struggle; a rights movement demanding civil, ethical, political and social positions at tables of power, equality and social justice. This perspective forms the core of changes in the past 50years in legal, social and political arenas that have taken place and is essential to understanding the growth, depth and nature of Disability Studies as a separate and legitimate field of inquiry. This study focuses primarily on studying the evolving literature in the core aspects of Disability Studies, using citation and text analyses to study trends in publishing patterns and the field's impact on the wider academic enterprise. Lack of thorough indexing to key journals made traditional citation analysis impossible, leading to the use of dissertations as a means to tease out useful information on the state of Disability Studies today. The most significant finding of the study is the lack of adequate indexing of key journals in standard scholarly databases, which can only limit the potential development of both the field and its impact/influence on related disciplines and professions. The study also found the significant role that dissertations can play in tracking new research directions."
"We tested the underlying assumption that citation counts are reliable predictors of future success, analyzing complete citation data on the careers of similar to 150,000 scientists. Our results show that i) among all citation indicators, the annual citations at the time of prediction is the best predictor of future citations, ii) future citations of a scientist's published papers can be predicted accurately (r(2)=0.80 for a 1-year prediction, P<0.001) but iii) future citations of future work are hardly predictable."
"Emerging metrics based on article-level does not exclude traditional metrics based on citations to the journal, but complements them. Both can be employed in conjunction to offer a richer picture of an article use from immediate to long terms. Article-level metrics (ALM) is the result of the aggregation of different data sources and the collection of content from multiple social network services. Sources used for the aggregation can be broken down into five categories: usage, captures, mentions, social media and citations. Data sources depend on the tool, but they include classic metrics indicators based on citations, academic social networks (Mendeley, CiteULike, Delicious) and social media (Facebook, Twitter, blogs, or Youtube, among others). Altmetrics is not synonymous with alternative metrics. Altmetrics are normally early available and allow to assess the social impact of scholarly outputs, almost at the real time. This paper overviews briefly the meaning of altmetrics and describes some of the existing tools used to apply this new metrics: Public Library of Science-Article-Level Metrics, Altmetric, Impactstory and Plum."
"If a peer review instrument asks concrete questions (defined as items that can only generate disagreement if reviewers have different degrees of expertise), then questionnaires could become more meaningful in terms of resolving subjectivity thus leading to more reviewer agreement. A concrete item questionnaire with well-chosen questions can also help resolve disagreement when reviewers have the same level of expertise. We have recently created the core-item reviewer evaluation (CoRE) questionnaire for which decision-threshold score levels have been created, but which have not been validated. This prospective validation of these thresholds for the CoRE questionnaire demonstrated strong agreement between reviewer recommendations and their reported score levels when tested prospectively at Clinical Medicine and Research. We conclude that using the CoRE questionnaire will help reduce peer reviewer disagreement. More importantly, when reviewer expertise varies, editors can more easily detect this and decide which opinion reflects the greater expertise."
"Employing a citation analysis, this study explored and compared the bibliometric characteristics and the subject relationship with other disciplines of and among the three leading information science journals, Journal of the American Society for Information Science and Technology (JASIST), Information Processing and Management and Journal of Documentation. The citation data were drawn from references of each article of the three journals during 1998 and 2008. The Ulrich's Periodical Directory, Library of Congress Subject Heading, retrieved from the WorldCat, and LISA database were used to identify the main class, subclass and subject of cited journals and books. Quantitative results on the number of JASIST, IPM and JOD literature references, average number of references cited per paper, document type of cited literature and the journal self-citation rate are reported. Moreover, the highly cited journals and books, the main classes and subclasses of cited journals and books in papers of the three journals, the highly cited subjects in journals and books of library and information science were identified and analyzed. Comparison on the characteristics of cited journals and books confirmed that all the three journals under study are information science oriented, except JOD which is library science orientation. JASIST and IPM are very much in common and diffuse to other disciplines more deeply than JOD."
"There has been ample demonstration that bibliometrics is superior to peer-review for national research assessment exercises in the hard sciences. In this paper we examine the Italian case, taking the 2001-2003 university performance rankings list based on bibliometrics as benchmark. We compare the accuracy of the first national evaluation exercise, conducted entirely by peer-review, to other rankings lists prepared at zero cost, based on indicators indirectly linked to performance or available on the Internet. The results show that, for the hard sciences, the costs of conducting the Italian evaluation of research institutions could have been completely avoided."
"The demographic characteristics of the publications produced by researchers at the Centre for Historical Studies (CEH) of El Colegio de Mexico (COLMEX) from 1948 to June 2010 are analyzed. The visibility and impact of the journals used by researchers at the CEH it is also studied. 4.304 documents published in that period were found. This production is concentrated in five types of documents, book chapters (23.95%), papers (22.8%), congresses' presentations (21.07%), books (14.75%) and critical reviews (11.13%). These documents are published primarily in Mexico (70.8%) and in Spanish language (87.04%). The journal Historia Mexicana holds the largest number of articles and reviews published. The journal with the highest h-index and JIF index was Hispanic American Historical Review. The bibliographical production of these researchers is growing exponentially."
"Scientific writing is a demanding task and many students need more time than expected to finish their research articles. To speed up the process, we highlight some tools, strategies as well as writing guides. We recommend starting early in the research process with writing and to prepare research articles, not after but in parallel to the lab or field work. We suggest considering scientific writing as a team enterprise, which needs proper organization and regular feedback. In addition, it is helpful to select potential target journals early and to consider not only scope and reputation, but also decision times and rejection rates. Before submission, instructions to authors and writing guides should be considered, and drafts should be extensively revised. Later in the process editor's and reviewer's comments should be followed. Our tips and tools help students and advisors to structure the writing and publishing process, thereby stimulating them to develop their own strategies to success.

"The present paper takes its place in the stream of studies that analyze the effect of interdisciplinarity on the impact of research output. Unlike previous studies, in this study the interdisciplinarity of the publications is not inferred through their citing or cited references, but rather by identifying the authors' designated fields of research. For this we draw on the scientific classification of Italian academics, and their publications as indexed in the WoS over a 5-year period (2004-2008). We divide the publications in three subsets on the basis the nature of co-authorship: those papers coauthored with academics from different fields, which show high intensity of inter-field collaboration (""specific'' collaboration, occurring in 110 pairings of fields); those papers coauthored with academics who are simply from different ""non-specific'' fields; and finally co-authorships within a single field. We then compare the citations of the papers and the impact factor of the publishing journals between the three subsets. The results show significant differences, generally in favor of the interdisciplinary authorships, in only one third (or slightly more) of the cases. The analysis provides the value of the median differences for each pair of publication subsets."
"Just as citations to a book can be counted, so can that book's libcitations-the number of libraries in a consortium that hold it. These holdings counts per title can be obtained from the consortium's union catalog, such as OCLC's WorldCat. Librarians seeking to serve their customers well must be attuned to various kinds of merit in books. The result in WorldCat is a great variation in the libcitations particular books receive. The higher a title's count (or percentile), the more famous it is-either absolutely or within a subject class. Degree of fame also indicates cultural impact, allowing that further documentation of impact may be needed. Using WorldCat data, we illustrate high, medium, and low degrees of fame with 170 titles published during 1990-1995 or 2001-2006 and spanning the 10 main Dewey classes. We use their total libcitation counts or their counts from members of the Association of Research Libraries, or both, as of late 2011. Our analysis of their fame draws on the recognizability of their authors, the extent to which they and their authors are covered by Wikipedia, and whether they have movie or TV versions. Ordinal scales based on Wikipedia coverage and on libcitation counts are very significantly associated."
"Nicaragua is a small country in Central America and little has been published about its scientific output. Most of its publications available in international databases are about medicine and are produced by Universidad Nacional Aut6noma de Nicaragua (Managua) as part of international collaborative teams. In this article we analyzed in more depth, and for a longer period than any previous study, the presence of Nicaraguan publications in the Science Citation Index Expanded until January, 2016. In total, 837 Nicaraguan articles were published in 456 journals (the top journal is the American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene). Internationally collaborative articles with 94 countries accounted for 92 % of articles, while only 8.5 % were exclusively Nicaraguan. The most cited article described the use of ketoconazole to treat Leishmaniasis. The authors with more publications in the database were A. Balmaseda, R. Pella, W. Strauch, and F. Bucardo. The top cited, exclusively Nicaraguan articles dealt with health problems, forest tenure, and food production. The article citation lifespan is surprisingly long: over 70 years. Most citations start seven years after publication and are not recorded by the Science Citation Index, which for that reason cannot be considered valid to evaluate the impact of Nicaraguan research. The predominance of English publications may reflect a bias of the database itself. Probably most of the scientific production of Nicaraguan scientists is published in Spanish, in many regional journals not included in the SCI-EXPANDED. Nicaraguan research centers lack appropriate infrastructure, staffing and financial resources: future achievements for Nicaraguan science should include a fair presence of female researchers, peer-to-peer level participation in international teams, and less dominance of health technologies."
"The preservation of historical and contemporary data safeguards our scientific legacy. Bioacoustic recordings can have historical as well as scientific value and should be assessed for their conservation requirements. Unpreserved bioacoustics recordings are generally not referenced and are frequently at high risk of loss by material degradation and/or by misplacement. In this study we investigated the preservation status of sets of natural sound recordings made in Portugal from 1983 until 2010 inclusive. We evaluated the recordings on the basis of their rate of loss, the degree to which unpreserved recordings could be preserved, and their risk of loss. Recordists of animal sounds were surveyed (by questionnaire or interview) to identify sets of recordings and to collect information on their quality and state of preservation. Of the 78 recordists identified, we found that 32% of the recordings have an unclear status and that only 9% of the recordings are lost. Of the c. 6 terabytes of unpreserved sound recordings discovered, an estimated 49% were recoverable. Moreover, 95% of the recoverable sets of recordings were at high risk of loss by their being misplaced. These risks can be minimized if recordists are persuaded to deposit their material in an institution committed to long-term curation of such data (e. g. sound archives). Overall, the study identified a considerable body of unpreserved animal sound recordings that could contribute to our scientific heritage and knowledge of the biodiversity found in Portugal. It highlights the need to implement effective policies to promote the deposit of recordings for preservation and to reverse the present scenario so that scientific material can be preserved for future generations."
"Objetive This study made a bibliometric analysis of the scientific production and information production and consumption of the Revista de Nutricao as a scientific journal in the field of the health sciences, between 2001 and 2007. Methods This is a descriptive, cross-sectional study on the scientific activity and information production published by the Revista de Nutricao, through the SciELO network in the abovementioned period. Results The journal published a total of 368 papers, of which 241 (65.49%) were original articles, and the productivity index was 2.38. Eighty-five institutions were represented by these papers. The main language is Portuguese, with 349 articles (94.84%). There were 1574 keywords, of which 1135 (72.11%) corresponded to DeCS or MeSH descriptors, and 102 articles (27.72%) with all keywords being equivalent to descriptors. Study of the keywords revealed a clear community trend. The median obsolescence of the references cited by Revista de Nutricao is 11 and the Price Index is 11.69%. The percentage of self-citations is 2.08. Conclusion In general, the Revista de Nutricao is a publication of international level that remains within the bibliometric indicators of the health sciences journals published in Latin American countries. The journal has an excellent equivalence between keywords and health sciences descriptors (DeCS). The obsolescence of its references was somewhat high but this changed in 2006 and 2007, the last years covered by this study."
"As one of the largest active academic social networking sites, ResearchGate (RG) has been utilized by scholars to share publications, seek collaborators, communicate work in progress, and build scholarly reputation. This study collects data from RG users from 61 U.S. research universities at different research activity levels, as categorized by the Carnegie Classification of Institutions of Higher Education, to examine the impact of institutional differences on RG reputational metrics. The results confirm that RG is a research-oriented academic social networking site that closely and realistically mirrors the research activity level of institutions. With an increase in the research activity level of a university, its affiliated RG users tend to have higher RG scores, more publications and citations, and more profile views and followers, while the average number of reads of their publications and followees tend to be lower and fluctuant. In addition, RG users primarily follow others from institutions of a higher research activity level, forming virtual social networks centered around esteemed institutions. The study suggests academic social networks can serve as indicators in evaluation of research activities among research institutions, and such sites can be helpful and credible for acquiring resources, keeping informed about research, and promoting academic influence.

"As all databases, the bibliometric ones (e.g. Scopus, Web of Knowledge and Google Scholar) are not exempt from errors, such as missing or wrong records, which may obviously affect publication/citation statistics and-more in general-the resulting bibliometric indicators. This paper tries to answer to the question ""What is the effect of database uncertainty on the evaluation of the h-index?"", breaking the paradigm of deterministic database analysis and treating responses to database queries as random variables. Precisely an informetric model of the h-index is used to quantify the variability of this indicator with respect to the variability stemming from errors in database records. Some preliminary results are presented and discussed."
"This paper introduces a statistical and other analysis of peer reviewers in order to approach their ""quality"" through some quantification measure, thereby leading to some quality metrics. Peer reviewer reports for the Journal of the Serbian Chemical Society are examined. The text of each report has first to be adapted to word counting software in order to avoid jargon inducing confusion when searching for the word frequency: e.g. C must be distinguished, depending if it means Carbon or Celsius, etc. Thus, every report has to be carefully ""rewritten"". Thereafter, the quantity, variety and distribution of words are examined in each report and compared to the whole set. Two separate months, according when reports came in, are distinguished to observe any possible hidden spurious effects. Coherence is found. An empirical distribution is searched for through a Zipf-Pareto rank-size law. It is observed that peer review reports are very far from usual texts in this respect. Deviations from the usual (first) Zipf's law are discussed. A theoretical suggestion for the ""best (or worst) report"" and by extension ""good (or bad) reviewer"", within this context, is provided from an entropy argument, through the concept of ""distance to average"" behavior. Another entropy-based measure also allows to measure the journal reviews (whence reviewers) for further comparison with other journals through their own reviewer reports."
"The article is devoted to crowdfunding as a rapidly developing area of investing in start-ups in any sphere. It was during the difficult period for the science that particular importance was given to crowdfunding as a collective cooperation of people (donors), who voluntarily collect their money or other resources usually via Internet to support other people' efforts or organizations in starting innovative venture projects. Crowdfunding as a tool to search and test investment ideas are gaining popularity in Russia nowadays for it allows to attract funding start-ups and venture capital for projects of all types and related activities, the only limiting factor being quality of the advertising campaigns and public interest for the project. This innovative model of financing projects of different types can be used on a much wider scale, at the level of enterprises and even by government agencies. Similar financing venture projects can be actively implemented, for example, in the system of higher education institutions through the establishing by the Ministry of Education and Science of the Russian Federation of a specialized on-line platform where research teams are entitled to position their projects."
"Background The Journal Citation Reports (JCR) Pharmacology and Pharmacy subject category is heterogeneous. The inclusion of journals with basic and clinical scopes, which have different citation patterns, compromises comparability of impact factors among journals within the category. Objective To subdivide the Pharmacology and Pharmacy category into basic pharmacology, clinical pharmacology, and pharmacy based on the analyses of Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) as a proxy of journals' scopes. Setting JCR. Method All articles, and respective MeSH, published in 2013, 2014, and 2015 in all journals included in the 2014 JCR Pharmacology and Pharmacy category were retrieved from PubMed. Several models using a combination of the 14 MeSH categories and specific MeSH tree branches were tested using hierarchical cluster analysis. Main outcome measure Distribution of journals across the subcategories of the JCR Pharmacology and Pharmacy subject category. Results A total of 107,847 articles from 214 journals were included. Nine different models combining the MeSH categories M (Persons) and N (Health Care) with specific MeSH tree branches (selected ad-hoc) and Pharmacy-specific MeSH (identified in previous research) consistently grouped 142 journals (66.4%) in homogeneous groups reflecting their basic and clinical pharmacology, and pharmacy scopes. Ultimately, journals were clustered into: 150 in basic pharmacology, 43 in clinical pharmacology, 16 in basic pharmacology and clinical pharmacology, and 5 in pharmacy. Conclusion The reformulation of the Pharmacology and Pharmacy category into three categories was demonstrated by the consistent results obtained from testing nine different clustering models using the MeSH terms assigned to their articles."
"Networked digital technologies and Open Access (OA) are transforming the processes and institutions of research, knowledge creation and dissemination globally: enabling new forms of collaboration, allowing researchers to be seen and heard in new ways and reshaping relationships between stakeholders across the global academic publishing system. This article draws on Joseph Nye's concept of Soft Power' to explore the role that OA is playing in helping to reshape academic publishing in China. It focusses on two important areas of OA development: OA journals and national-level repositories. OA is being supported at the highest levels, and there is potential for it to play an important role in increasing the status and impact of Chinese scholarship. Investments in OA also have the potential to help China to re-position itself within international copyright discourses: moving beyond criticism for failure to enforce the rights of foreign copyright owners and progressing an agenda that places greater emphasis on equality of access to the resources needed to foster innovation. However, the potential for OA to help China to build and project its soft power is being limited by the legacies of the print era, as well as the challenges of efficiently governing the national research and innovation systems."
"This paper is the second of two Learned Publishing articles in which we report the results of a series of interviews, with senior publishers and editors exploring open access megajournals (OAMJs). Megajournals (of which PLoS One is the best known example) represent a relatively new approach to scholarly communication and can be characterized as large, broad-scope, open access journals, which take an innovative approach to peer review, basing acceptance decisions solely on the technical or scientific soundness of the article. Based on interviews with 31 publishers and editors, this paper reports the perceived cultural, operational, and technical challenges associated with launching, growing, and maintaining a megajournal. We find that overcoming these challenges while delivering the societal benefits associated with OAMJs is seen to require significant investment in people and systems, as well as an ongoing commitment to the model."
"The role of competitive funds as a source of funding for academic research has increased in many countries. For the individual researcher, the receipt of a grant can influence both scientific production and career paths. This paper focuses on the importance of the receipt of a research grant for researchers' academic career paths utilizing a mixed methods approach that combines econometric analysis with in-depth qualitative interviews. The analysis has novel elements both in terms of its subject (impact of funding grants on individuals' academic career paths) and approach. The results of this study indicate that while research grants have a positive impact on the research performed under the grant itself, there are very important secondary effects on research performance through positive effects on academic career advancement. The probability of obtaining a full professorship for grant recipients is almost double that for rejected applicants, 16 percent compared to 9 percent. The probability for career advancement in general is about 9 percentage points higher for grant recipients. Qualitative interviews support these quantitative results by providing insights into how grants impact research careers, through heightened status, recognition, networking and other factors."
"'Discometrics', a long neglected area of informetric studies was revisited in a network context. Cooperation between jazz musicians was analysed using the recent 'Hirschian' concepts of network informetrics. Partnership Ability Index (phi) was found to be a useful measure to characterize the way performers are embedded in their partnership network. Indications of some positive relations between phi and other 'qualities' of the performers were found. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."
"The computer science research paper review process is largely human and time-intensive. More worrisome, review processes are frequently questioned, and often non-transparent. This work advocates applying computer science methods and tools to the computer science review process. As an initial exploration, we data mine the submissions, bids, reviews, and decisions from a recent top-tier computer networking conference. We empirically test several common hypotheses, including the existence of readability, citation, call-for-paper adherence, and topical bias. From our findings, we hypothesize review process methods to improve fairness, efficiency, and transparency."
"Objective: To identify the 100 top-cited articles published in orthodontics journals and to analyze their characteristics to investigate the achievement and development of orthodontics research in past decades. Methods and Materials: The Institute for Scientific Information Web of Knowledge Database and the 2011 Journal Citation Report Science Editions were used to retrieve the 100 top-cited articles published in orthodontics journals since 1975. Some basic information was collected by the Analyze Tool on the Web of Science, including citation time, publication title, journal name, publication year, and country and institution of origin. A further study was then performed to determine authorship, article type, field of study, study design, and level of evidence. Results: The 100 target articles were retrieved from three journals: American Journal of Orthodontics and Dentofacial Orthopedics (n = 74), The Angle Orthodontist (n = 15), and European Journal of Orthodontics (n = 11). Since 1975, the articles cited 89 to 545 times mainly originated from the United States, and the overwhelming majority of articles were clinical. The most common study design was case series; 40 articles were classified as level IV and 12 as level V evidence. Conclusions: The 100 top-cited articles in orthodontics are generally old articles, rarely possessing high-level evidence. (Angle Orthod. 2013;83:491-499.)"
"The relation between information science and library science has been debated for decades, and even attempts at utilizing methods generally acknowledged as robust for the purpose of mapping research fields have yielded results with large variations. Therefore, a set of citation analyses was performed, comparing the results of analyses on information science and library science separately but also as a joint library and information science ( LIS) field. Although there are large differences, not the least in the author-level analyses, the patterns in the citation data support the concept of a joint LIS field with information science and library science being the two main subfields; many of the variations in the analyses are caused by the interdisciplinary nature of LIS, reflected in, for example, variations in citation practices in the different subfields."
"The growing importance of scientific publications of quality, their impact on society in general and on authors' processes of scientific recognition, as well as journals needing to have international visibility, may increase the number of conflicts of interests among editors, authors and reviewers of scientific publications. The aim of this article is to review recommendations of existing ethics codes. Major international initiatives, their sponsoring entities and specific recommendations made to the different agents of the process are analyzed. The review reveals that the degree of awareness about the ethics of the publications in each discipline and each country depends on tradition, associations, the established reputation and the degree of internationalization of the journals that make up each scientific field."
"Based on the concept that scientific research is an important component of a country's knowledge-based economy, this study aims to answer the question ""Are CIVETS the next BRICs"" by comparing a series of scientometrics indicators using data from the Essential Science Indicators database and the World Bank Report 2009. The main findings are that at the country group level, there is no significant difference between CIVETS and BRICs in knowledge-based economy performance, scientific research quality and scientific research structure and that the number of scientific research papers is the clear gap between them. The results may be of use to find the answer to the question ""Are CIVETS the next BRICs"" at least from the perspective of scientometrics."
"Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to identify criteria for and definitions of disciplinarity, and how they differ between different types of literature. Design/methodology/approach - This synthesis is achieved through a purposive review of three types of literature: explicit conceptualizations of disciplinarity; narrative histories of disciplines; and operationalizations of disciplinarity. Findings - Each angle of discussing disciplinarity presents distinct criteria. However, there are a few common axes upon which conceptualizations, disciplinary narratives, and measurements revolve: communication, social features, topical coherence, and institutions. Originality/value - There is considerable ambiguity in the concept of a discipline. This is of particular concern in a heightened assessment culture, where decisions about funding and resource allocation are often discipline-dependent (or focussed exclusively on interdisciplinary endeavors). This work explores the varied nature of disciplinarity and, through synthesis of the literature, presents a framework of criteria that can be used to guide science policy makers, scientometricians, administrators, and others interested in defining, constructing, and evaluating disciplines."
"The Keeling curve has become a chemical landmark, whereas the papers by Charles David Keeling about the underlying carbon dioxide measurements are not cited as often as can be expected against the backdrop of his final approval. In this bibliometric study, we analyze Keeling's papers as a case study for under-citedness of climate change publications. Three possible reasons for the under-citedness of Keeling's papers are discussed: (1) The discourse on global cooling at the starting time of Keeling's measurement program, (2) the underestimation of what is often seen as ""routine science"", and (3) the amount of implicit/informal citations at the expense of explicit/formal (reference-based) citations. Those reasons may have contributed more or less to the slow reception and the under-citedness of Keeling's seminal works."
"Objective: To analyze the types of articles and authorship characteristics of three orthodontic journals-American Journal of Orthodontics and Dentofacial Orthopedics (AJODO), The Angle Orthodontist (AO), and European Journal of Orthodontics (EJO)-published between 2008 and 2012 and to assess the differences in content within this period and an earlier period of 1998 to 2002. Materials and Methods: Each journal's content was accessed through the web edition. From each article, the following parameters were recorded: article type, number of authors, number of affiliations, source of article (referring to the first author's affiliation), and geographic origin. Descriptive statistics were performed and selected parameters were analyzed with the Pearson chi-square or Fisher exact test for independence at the .05 level of significance. Results: Review of differences between the two periods showed that the number of publications was almost double. The percentages of multi-authored articles increased. Fewer studies derived from the United States/Canada and European Union countries. Increases for articles from non-European Union countries, Asia, and other countries were found. Characteristics of the second period showed that the EJO and AO published more research articles, whereas the AJODO regularly published case reports and other articles. Approximately 75% of all studies derived from orthodontic departments. Conclusions: The publications from 1998-2002 and 2008-2012 were significantly different both in terms of numbers and characteristics. Within 2008-2012 there were notable differences between the three journals concerning the type and origin of the publications."
"Management and organization studies commentary on how authors experience peer review of journal papers suggests that it can be an overly interventionist process which reduces the originality and coherence of eventual publications. In the literature on co-authorship, this argument is reversed. Here, free riders who do not contribute fully to research collaborations and the practice of gift authorships are problematized, and it is argued that everyone involved in writing a published paper should be rewarded with co-authorship. In this article, qualitative interviews with 12 management and organization studies academics see respondents describing peer review as a transaction during which reviewers - and editors - actually co-author published papers. But their perspectives on this vary with the subject position from which they are speaking. When they speak as reviewers or editors, this co-authorship is depicted as a collegiate gift, a professional obligation or a process where authors might over-rely on reviewers' generosity. When they speak as authors or their proxies, it is characterized as reproducing disciplinary orthodoxy and ethnocentric exclusion, perpetuating disciplinary cliques, creating disorganized papers and constituting excessive interference with authorial privilege. These various perspectives on peer review deserve more attention in our empirical studies of academic labour. They also suggest we should reflect more on when, how and why we collaborate in our research and on how much we should recognize additional co-authors on (or resist their input into) our' work."
"Background: The analysis of scientific networks has been applied in health research to map and measure relationships between researchers and institutions, describing collaboration structures, individual roles, and research outputs, and helping the identification of knowledge gaps and cooperation opportunities. Driven by dengue continued expansion in Brazil, we explore the contribution, dynamics and consolidation of dengue scientific networks that could ultimately inform the prioritisation of research, financial investments and health policy. Method: Social network analysis (SNA) was used to produce a 20-year (1995-2014) retrospective longitudinal evaluation of dengue research networks within Brazil and with its partners abroad, with special interest in describing institutional collaboration and their research outputs. Results: The analysis of institutional co-authorship showed a significant expansion of collaboration over the years, increased international involvement, and ensured a shift from public health research toward vector control and basic biomedical research, probably as a reflection of the expansion of transmission, high burden and increasing research funds from the Brazilian government. The analysis identified leading national organisations that maintained the research network connectivity, facilitated knowledge exchange and reduced network vulnerability. Conclusions: SNA proved to be a valuable tool that, along with other indicators, can strengthen a knowledge platform to inform future policy, planning and funding decisions. The paper provides relevant information to policy and planning for dengue research as it reveals: (1) the effectiveness of the research network in knowledge generation, sharing and diffusion; (2) the near-absence of collaboration with the private sector; and (3) the key central organisations that can support strategic decisions on investments, development and implementation of innovations. In addition, the increase in research activities and collaboration has not yet significantly affected dengue transmission, suggesting a limited translation of research efforts into public health solutions."
"This paper used bibliometrics to examine patterns of publication output in library and information science (LIS) research in Nigerian universities from 2000 to 2014 in terms of the trend in publication output in LIS research, the most visible (productive) universities and authors, the most cited universities and authors, and publication sources. The Web of Science was used as the source of the data. The findings of the study revealed a fluctuating and unpredictable trend in the annual publication output in LIS research in Nigeria. The University of Ibadan, University of Nigeria, and Delta State University were found to be the three most visible (productive) universities in LIS research. Based on the findings of this study, it is recommended that there should be increased investment in LIS research by Nigerian universities towards a steady increase in sustained quality publication output to support national development."
"Purpose - The purpose of this paper (bibliometric analysis) is to analyse the global scientific outputs, research patterns, research emphases and trends of law and psychiatry (L& P) research during 1993-2012 from the Web of Science (WOS) database. Besides, the paper also offers an overview to deepen intercultural understanding and cooperation in the field among professionals concerned with the interface of this research field and related disciplines. Design/methodology/approach - This paper conducted a bibliometric study of the characteristics and patterns of publication outputs, major journals, network of co-occurrence of authors, international productivity and collaboration. Findings - International Journal of Law and Psychiatry, Journal of the American Academy of Psychiatry and the Law and Psychiatry, Psychology and Law were the representative journals in the field of L& P research. The results from the analysis of co-occurrence of authors suggest that the L& P co-authorship network analysis is relatively fragmented. In addition, the most productive institution was the University of California System, which published the most inter-institutional collaborative publications and was the top institution by centrality measures. The Harvard University published the most single-institute publications. The most productive country was the USA, which was the top country by centrality measures. The USA was the most collaborative country and took the central position in the collaborative network. Originality/value - This is the first study to quantify and evaluate global research productivity in L& P viewed through the WOS during 1993-2012, which might provide a potential guide for future research among professionals concerned with the interface of L& P, as it is a very constructive contribution to the area."
"229 Chinese-language biomedical journals from A Guide to The Core Journals of China were investigated for their guidance on 14 ethical issues. The issues of authorship, duplicate submission, privacy and confidentiality, and integrity of the data were mentioned in more than 50% of the journals. Except for the issues of authorship and protection of animals in research, significant differences were found between Chinese Medical Association Publishing House (CMAPH) journals (n = 67) and non-CMAPH journals (n = 162) (P < 0.05). 66 of the 229 journals did not update their instructions for authors regularly. 196 journal instructions listed authorship criteria, while the other 33 did not. Clinical trial registration policy was required by 26 (11.3%) journals, among which the CONSORT statement for randomized trials was required by 23, and only one journal guided the authors to work in line with the EQUATOR Network. The study concludes that the situation of publishing ethics in the instructions for authors of Chinese biomedical journals is not favorable, and that Chinese biomedical editors should learn more about publishing ethics in order to reduce opportunities for publication problems.

"Machine learning community is not only interested in maximizing classification accuracy, but also in minimizing the distances between the actual and the predicted class. Some ideas, like the cost-sensitive learning approach, are proposed to face this problem. In this paper, we propose two greedy wrapper forward cost-sensitive selective naive Bayes approaches. Both approaches readjust the probability thresholds of each class to select the class with the minimum-expected cost. The first algorithm (CS-SNB-Accuracy) considers adding each variable to the model and measures the performance of the resulting model on the training data. The variable that most improves the accuracy, that is, the percentage of well classified instances between the readjusted class and actual class, is permanently added to the model. In contrast, the second algorithm (CS-SNB-Cost) considers adding variables that reduce the misclassification cost, that is, the distance between the readjusted class and actual class. We have tested our algorithms on the bibliometric indices prediction area. Considering the popularity of the well-known h-index, we have researched and built several prediction models to forecast the annual increase of the h-index for Neurosciences journals in a four-year time horizon. Results show that our approaches, particularly CS-SNB-Accuracy, achieved higher accuracy values than the analyzed cost-sensitive classifiers and Bayesian classifiers. Furthermore, we also noted that the CS-SNB-Cost always achieved a lower average cost than all analyzed cost-sensitive and cost-insensitive classifiers. These cost-sensitive selective naive Bayes approaches outperform the selective naive Bayes in terms of accuracy and average cost, so the cost-sensitive learning approach could be also applied in different probabilistic classification approaches.

"This study explores the international profiles in collaboration and mobility of countries included in the so-called ""travel bans"" implemented by US President Trump as executive order in 2017. The objective of this research is to analyze the exchange of knowledge between countries and the relative importance of specific countries in order to inform evidence-based science policy. The work serves as a proof-of-concept of the utility of asymmetry and affinity indexes for collaboration and mobility. Comparative analyses of these indicators can be useful for informing immigration policies and motivating collaboration and mobility relationships-emphasizing the importance of geographic and cultural similarities. Egocentric and relational perspectives are analyzed to provide various lenses on the importance of countries. Our analysis suggests that comparisons of collaboration and mobility from an affinity perspective can identify discrepancies between levels of collaboration and mobility. This approach can inform international immigration policies and, if extended, demonstrate potential partnerships at several levels of analysis (e.g., institutional, sectoral, state/province)."
"Governmental spending on science is usually justified by claims that the resulting research will yield benefits for the sponsoring nation. I present policy-analytic and ethnographic research-based on 30 hour-long interviews-of the Mexican ecological research community to explore the structural influence of publication incentives on research content and its relevance to national needs. During a financial crisis in the 1980s, Mexico created a national publication incentive system, the Sistema Nacional de Investigadores, to identify and reward scientists producing the most and the most-cited research as defined by dominant international scientific norms at the time. The system has increased productivity but in the process has undermined that country's ability to benefit from its ecological research by surrendering priority setting to the editorial preferences of journals that are linguistically and financially unavailable to potential domestic users. The Mexican experience has implications for institutions worldwide that utilize quantitative productivity measures in researcher evaluation."
"The authors sought to systematically examine patterns of change over time, as well as current variations, in educational journal specifications and publishing, including higher education. The 100 journals in this sample included research and practitioner venues across a range of subdomains and specializations. The authors gathered data for 3 points in time, at 10-year intervals during a 20-year period, from 1989-2009. They examined the following in detail: journal profiles for publishing characteristics, submission specifications for manuscript parameters, and full-text published manuscripts for compliance with specifications. All were analyzed as point-in-time comparisons as well as trajectories of change over time. Journal profiles demonstrated patterns of increased centralization and digitization, inclusiveness of readership, increased frequency of issues, and increased length of articles. Key findings for manuscript parameter trends included increased specificity of detail, range of manuscript types and research designs accepted, and average manuscript length. In addition, journals have more explicitly specified elements previously left implicit, such as professional and ethical standards. Criteria for submission procedures and manuscript quality are consistent with university faculty performance standards for productivity and technological advancement. Findings carry implications for publishing, journal management, faculty work, and performance evaluation."
"This paper presents the first meta-analysis of studies that computed correlations between the h index and variants of the h index (such as the g index; in total 37 different variants) that have been proposed and discussed in the literature. A high correlation between the h index and its variants would indicate that the h index variants hardly provide added information to the h index. This meta-analysis included 135 correlation coefficients from 32 studies. The studies were based on a total sample size of N = 9005; on average, each study had a sample size of n = 257. The results of a three-level cross-classified mixed-effects meta-analysis show a high correlation between the h index and its variants: Depending on the model, the mean correlation coefficient varies between 8 and 9. This means that there is redundancy between most of the h index variants and the h index. There is a statistically significant study-to-study variation of the correlation coefficients in the information they yield. The lowest correlation coefficients with the h index are found for the h index variants MII and m index. Hence, these h index variants make a non-redundant contribution to the h index.

"The analytical point of departure in this paper is the ongoing debate, initiated by Ulrich Beck, on methodological nationalism within the social sciences. Based on a comprehensive study of research collaboration and mobility of researchers this paper discusses possible traces of methodological nationalism in comparative studies of research performance. These studies are often carried out as country comparisons with no or little focus on the growing transnationality of what is measured. However, research is a transnational activity and must be understood as such. Researchers increasingly collaborate with researchers in other countries. The national research institutions are increasingly transnationalised due to the growing mobility of researchers. Based on an examination of all the papers registered in the Thompson Reuter's Web of Science database we follow the development in research collaboration in the period 1980-2014 for 17 leading research countries."
"This study evaluates research carried out in Pakistan during 1975-2014 in the fields of pharmacy and pharmacology using different bibliometric indicators. The data have been retrieved from online database of the ISI Web of Science. The global share of Pakistan in the publications in the fields of pharmacy and pharmacology is only 0.25%. The volume and quality of research in pharmacology and pharmacy revealed a positive trend in Pakistan from 2005 onwards, as measured by the number of articles published in ISI-indexed journals. The average annual growth rate is 29.29% for publications and 34.22% for citations. If compared with Asian countries, 27 countries including Pakistan are ranked in top 100 publishing countries in the field of pharmacology/pharmacy by Web of Science. Out of those 27 countries, Pakistan holds 13th rank and still needs concrete measures to increase research productivity and visibility of researchers in the field of pharmacology/pharmacy."
"Worldwide research contributions have allowed the field of fracture surgery to progress. However, to the best of our knowledge, no studies have documented the main characteristics of publications from different countries. The present study aimed to determine the quantity and quality of worldwide research in fracture surgery. The Web of Science database was searched to identify fracture articles published between 2005 and 2014. The contributions of countries were evaluated based on paper and citation numbers, and the research output of each country was adjusted according to population size. A total of 19,423 papers on the topic of fracture surgery were identified worldwide, and the total number of publications from 2005 to 2014 had significantly increased by 1.82-fold (P<0.001). The majority of papers (86.64%) were published by high-income countries (gross national income per capita >=$ 12,736), 13.25% by middle-income countries ($ 1,046-12,735) and 0.11% by low-income countries (>=$ 1,045). The United States contributed the highest number of publications (33.34%), followed by the United Kingdom (9.03%), Germany (8.42%), China (5.58%) and Japan (4.18%). Furthermore, the United States ranked first according to total citations (72,640). Articles from Sweden achieved the highest average citations per paper (15.63), followed by Australia (12.84) and Canada (12.44). When the number of publications were adjusted for population size, Switzerland was the first (56.39), followed by Austria (35.43) and the Netherlands (30.68). In conclusion, the number of publications in fracture surgery increased from 2005 to 2014, and the majority of fracture papers were published by high-income countries, while few papers were published by low-income countries. The United States was the most prolific country, but based on population size, a number of smaller countries in Europe may be relatively more prolific."
"Objective: To identify and analyze the 50 most-cited gastroenterology and hepatology articles originating from mainland China. Methods: We utilized the 2015 edition of Journal Citation Reports and PubMed to determine the 50 mostcited gastroenterology and hepatology articles from 75 professional journals and four leading journals in clinical medicine, which are The New England Journal of Medicine, The Lancet, The Journal of the American Medical Association, and The British Medical Journal. Then we excluded the articles written outside mainland China and collected the basic information, including the title, authors, year of publication, source journal, city, institution, number of citations, and topic of the research. Results: The number of citations for the top 50 papers ranged from 279 to 89 (mean, 129). These articles were published between 2005 and 2012, in which 2009 was the year with the largest number of highly cited papers(13). All articles were published in 15 journals. The journal Hepatology published the largest number of articles(21), followed by Journal of Gastroenterology and Hepatology(4), Journal of Hepatology(4) and World Journal of Gastroenterology(4). The top 50 articles originated mainly from Shanghai (20), Guangzhou(13) and Beijing(6). Sun Yat-sen University produced most highly cited papers(10). The number of basic research was far more than clinical research, of which the ratio was about 1.78(32:18). In all these articles, hepatocellular carcinoma was the most-discussed topic(19), followed by hepatitis B virus(8) and endoscopic(5). Conclusions: Although a large gap remains between mainland China and the global community, the gastroenterology and hepatology research from China is gradually recognized by the world."
"Purpose - The main purpose of this paper is to measure the status and quality of library and information science (LIS) open-access (OA) journals in the Social Science Citation Index (SSCI). Design/methodology/approach - The study selected 86 source journals of LIS in the SSCI as a sample and measured their status of open access. Analytic hierarchy process (AHP) was used to analyze 36 OA journals of 86 source journals, especially their production capability, academic influence and network communication ability. Findings - The results indicate that OA journals have become an increasingly important part of LIS journals. Production capability, academic influence and network communication ability are important factors affecting the quality of OA journals. These three evaluation indicators of LIS OA journals are high, but many still have room for improvement. Research limitations/implications - As the paper is limited by collecting data, the indicators of OA journals' quality are not all-around. So, they cannot reflect the quality of LIS OA journals. In the selection of the evaluation method, the evaluation results are limited because only one AHP method is used. Practical implications - The research on evaluation of OA journals can help library and scientific research personnel use OA journals effectively. Identifying key factors on evaluation can help researchers to construct OA journals better. Social implications - The research on OA journals' quality can also promote the study on OA process in academic circles and promote the communication, development and utilization of academic information. Such research can also enrich the theory of OA, and provide some new perspectives for the study of journals' evaluation. Originality/value - This paper measures the quality of LIS OA journals by analyzing production capability, academic influence and network communication ability. Rather than the traditional research methods, the focus of this study is on the value of the Web as a source of impact indices. It contributes to the scholarly impact measurements of OA journals."
"Research metrics are quantitative measurements that identify and acknowledge research output while enhancing article, author and journal impact within the academic community. The article impact depends on the number of times that same article is cited by other authors, while an author's impact depends on the number of citations received on the total number of published articles by the same author. With the advancement in technology and the increased availability of open access journals, article-level metrics has become a popular metric. This is the aggregation of the traditional article citations and the article online presence through blogs, tweets and newspapers, which further enhances the author's impact within the academic community. A journal's impact will depend on the average number of citations received by the articles published within the journal over a period of time. The academic reputation within the academic community will therefore depend on both article and author metrics and is further enhanced by publishing in high impact journals."
"The way in which scientific publications are picked up by the research community can vary. Some articles become instantly cited, whereas others go unnoticed for some time before they are discovered or rediscovered. Papers with delayed recognition have also been labeled sleeping beauties. I briefly discuss an extreme case of a sleeping beauty. Peirce's short note in Science in 1884 shows a remarkable increase in citations since around 2000. The note received less than 1 citation per year in the decades prior to 2000, 3.5 citations per year in the 2000s, and 10.4 in the 2010s. This increase was seen in several domains, most notably meteorology, medical prediction research, and economics. The paper outlines formulas to evaluate a binary prediction system for a binary outcome. This citation increase in various domains may be attributed to a widespread, growing research focus on mathematical prediction systems and the evaluation thereof. Several recently suggested evaluation measures essentially reinvented or extended Peirce's 120-year-old ideas."
"In the last 50 years, there have been many changes to the substance, conduct, and style of research. Many of these changes have proved disastrous to the life of scientists and to science itself. As a consequence, the near-romantic spirit of adventure and exploration that inspired young scientists of my own and earlier generations has become tarnished. Now, many of us feel beleaguered by bureaucrats and by politicians: they affect our lives profoundly, apparently without an understanding of the way discoveries are made or of the nature of science itself. The core purposes of universities, teaching and research, are being eroded by excessive administration. The number and locations of our publications are counted up like beans and the outcomes are used to rank us, one against another; a process of evaluation that has recast the purposes of publication. Applying for grants takes far too much time from a young scientist's life."
"Internationalization has become a widely accepted goal among all stakeholders in science, who seek visibility across national borders from an exogenous logic in the process of knowledge construction. With this in mind, the road map of Universitas Psychologica on its way to internationalization is analyzed. It is concluded that such publication is a reference in the scientific debate of Psychology, given the predominant weight of foreign production, driven mainly by foreign author collaboration; this openness is replicated in domestic production and in the journal usage, whose downloads take place primarily outside the journal's country. For the analysis, it is considered almost a thousand articles of this journal integrated in redalyc.org published in the period from 2002 to 2015; by using the indicators provided by this database related to production, collaboration and usage."
"Cross-sectional studies typically find positive correlations between free availability of scientific articles ('open access') and citations. Using a number of instruments as plausible sources of exogeneous variation, we find no evidence for a causal effect of open access on citations. We provide theory and evidence suggesting that authors of higher quality papers are more likely to choose open access in hybrid journals which offer an open access option. Self-selection mechanisms may thus explain the discrepancy between the positive correlation found in Eysenbach (2006) and other cross-sectional studies and the absence of such correlation in the field experiment of Davis et al. (2008). (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."
"The purpose of this paper is to gain a deeper understanding of the nexus between the use of citation counts as a measure of scientific impact, citations as indicator of scientific impact, citation distributions of scientific papers, citation analysis as a tool in journal evaluation, and the validity and reliability of citation counts in research assessments. The mainstay of the paper is formed by an analysis of the extent to which the impact factor indicates the quality of a journal, the biases of the impact factor, excessive orientation towards the impact factor, citation counts and impact factors as quality indicators to judge journals, and the use of the impact factor as a metric of journal status."
"This article introduces the Impact Factor squared or IF2-index, an h-like indicator of research performance. This indicator reflects the degree to which large entities such as countries and/or their states participate in top-level research in a field or subfield. The IF2-index uses the Journal Impact Factor (JIF) of research publications instead of the number of citations. This concept is applied to other h-type indexes and their results compared to the IF2-index. These JIF-based indexes are then used to assess the overall performance of cancer research in Australia and its states over 8 years from 1999 to 2006. The IF2-index has three advantages when evaluating larger research units: firstly, it provides a stable value that does not change over time, reflecting the degree to which a research unit participated in top-level research in a given year; secondly, it can be calculated closely approximating the publication date of yearly datasets; and finally, it provides an additional dimension when a full article-based citation analysis is not feasible. As the index reflects the degree of participation in top-level research it may favor larger units when units of different sizes are compared."
"The number of times that a published article is cited is one indicator of its scientific impact. An article is termed a Citation Classic once it has accumulated more than 400 citations. Trends in these highly cited works allow projection of future directions of high-impact research within a field. Herein, we identified 89 articles in the field of epilepsy published in 35 different journals that have been cited more than 400 times (citation range 4013,749). The journal that published the greatest number of Citation Classics was Epilepsia (9 articles with 656 mean citations per article). Laboratory studies constituted the fastest growing area of highly cited epilepsy research, whereas clinical studies showed a bimodal distribution in representation among Citation Classics. There were also considerably fewer epilepsy-specific Citation Classics compared to other disciplines. In this study, we find that the Citation Classics of epilepsy comprise a heterogeneous group of articles and that changes in the trends of these highly cited works represent the evolution of epilepsy research over time. The results of this study should inform the academic community and provide a guide of essential literature for scientists who are engaged in epilepsy research."
"The XI National and IV International meeting of animal and veterinary sciences (ENICIP) has been gathering researchers to socialize their advances to the scientific community since 1989. It is perceived in this meeting the presence of wide relations among researchers and institutions in the different areas of animal and veterinary science. Objective: to identify the social networking of scientific productivity in the areas of the animal and veterinary sciences. Methods: data from the authors that submitted research papers to ENICIP 2011 was collected. A matrix array for papers by author, papers by topic and authors by topic was used. The arrays were analyzed with UCINET (R) software. Results: 1270 researchers submitted 560 abstracts in 20 different areas. The areas with highest participation of researchers were animal nutrition and feeding (252), epidemiology and public health (153) and pastures and silvopastoral systems (131). The areas with the highest number of submitted abstracts were animal nutrition and feeding (103), animal breeding and genetics (53) and pastures and silvopastoral systems (48). Solid clusters between researchers, and new researchers with high productivity, but low social relations were found. Conclusion: the scientific communities in agricultural sciences shows high interrelationship among its different areas; nevertheless higher interrelationship among researchers from different institutions would be advantageous."
"Human-animal studies (HAS) is a legitimate and multidisciplinary academic endeavor. In the last three decades, there has been a proliferation of articles revealing multiple ways of knowing about the human-animal relationship. This paper, informed by social psychological theories, turns the mirror upon new researchers as they emerge as professional selves into academia. Post-graduate students engage multiple and sometimes contradicting identities throughout their candidatures. The unit of analysis is the dissertation acknowledgement (DA) at both a structural and functional level. The DAS have recently become objects of serious empirical investigation as linguistic choice promotes a situated academic, cultural, and social identity in a moment of time. This paper examines the generic structure and purpose of 104 DAS, with a particular focus on the student-writer's identity with relationship to nonhuman animals in their lives. Fourteen sub-themes are subsumed into thanking, reflecting, and announcing moves. A case is made that the study of DAS is a potentially fecund research area for a unique moment of identity construction."
"Education scientific journals are a key element for the progress of educational research. The added value which might be expected from the rising prices of scientific journals has one of its accountable factors in the bibliometric indicators as a measure of performance. The research question addressed in this paper is whether there are significant differences in bibliometric performance of the most expensive (in terms of price per article, price per citation and other related measures detailed in Appendix I) educational research journals in JCR 2013 when compared with the less expensive educational journals or not. For this purpose, data was gathered from Journal Prices and Journal Citation Reports, for Education & Educational Research journals. Statistical analyses comparing the bibliometric performance of the most expensive against the less expensive educational research journals evidences the existence of non-significative differences between the two segments in most of the variables analyzed, thus putting into question the added value of buying and / or publishing in expensive educational research journals. It is concluded that, at least from a bibliometric perspective, expensive educational journals do not add significant value to the contents published. This can be understood as an abnormality in the market of scientific journals and might, in the long run, compromise the knowledge exchange among researchers working in education fields."
"Sci-Hub hosts pirated copies of 51 million scientific papers from commercial publishers. This article presents the site's characteristics, it criticizes that it might be perceived as a de-facto component of the Open Access movement, it replicates an analysis published in Science using its available usage data, but limiting it to Latin America, and presents implications caused by this site for information professionals, universities and libraries."
"Object. The volume of scientific literature doubles approximately every 7 years. The coverage of this literature provided by online compendia is variable and incomplete. It would hence be useful to identify ""core"" journals in any field and validate whether the h index and impact factor truly identify the core journals in every subject. The core journals in every medical specialty would be those that provide a current and comprehensive coverage of the science in that specialty. Identifying these journals would make it possible for individual physicians to keep abreast of research and clinical progress. Methods. The top 10 neurosurgical journals (on the basis of impact factor and h index) were selected. A database of all articles cited in the reference lists of papers published in issues of these journals published in the first quarter of 2012 was generated. The journals were ranked based on the number of papers cited from each. This citation rank list was compared with the h index and impact factor rank lists. The rank list was also examined to see if the concept of core journals could be validated for neurosurgical literature using Bradford's law. Results. A total of 22,850 papers spread across 2522 journals were cited in neurosurgical literature over 3 months. Although the top 10 journals were the same, irrespective of ranking criterion (h index, impact factor, citation ranking), the 3 rank lists were not congruent. The top 25% of cited articles obeyed the Bradford distribution; beyond this, there was a zone of increased scatter. Six core journals were identified for neurosurgery. Conclusions. The core journals for neurosurgery were identified to be Journal of Neurosurgery, Neurosurgery, Spine, Acta Neurochirurgica, Stroke, and Journal of Neurotrauma. A list of core journals could similarly be generated for every subject. This would facilitate a focused reading to keep abreast of current knowledge. Collated across specialties, these journals could depict the current status of medical science."
"This article describes the configuration of the scientific field in Brazil, characterizing the scientific communities in every major area of knowledge in terms of installed capacity, ability to train new researchers, and capacity for academic production. Empirical data from several sources of information are used to characterize the different communities. Articulating the theoretical contributions of Pierre Bourdieu, Ludwik Fleck, and Thomas Kuhn, the following types of capital are analyzed for each community: social capital (scientific prestige), symbolic capital (dominant paradigm), political capital (leadership in S & T policy), and economic capital (resources). Scientific prestige is analyzed by taking into account the volume of production, activity index, citations, and other indicators. To characterize symbolic capital, the dominant paradigms that distinguish the natural sciences, the humanities, applied sciences, and technology development are analyzed theoretically. Political capital is measured by presidency in one of the main agencies in the S & T national system, and research resources and fellowships define the economic capital. The article discusses the composition of these different types of capital and their correspondence to structural capacities in various communities with the aim of describing the configuration of the Brazilian scientific field."
"By using the data from two recent survey-based rankings of knowledge management / intellectual capital and eHealth journals, this study tests the impact of personal research interests of journal raters on their ranking scores. The rationale is that raters assign higher scores to journals that cater to their area of expertise because they are more familiar with them. The results indicate the existence of raters' bias toward the journals focusing on their preferred areas of interest, but this bias does not uniformly apply across all research topics. In some subdomains, such as intellectual capital, this bias may be very strong, whereas in others, such as soft-side knowledge management research, it may be nonexistent. Although management eHealth researchers rate management-focused journals higher than their clinical-centered counterparts, this bias does not exist among scholars favoring clinical topics. While this limitation is not fatal, the results from expert-survey journal ranking studies should be interpreted with caution."
"Citations are regarded as measures of quality yet citation rates vary widely within each of the top finance journals. Since article ordering is at the discretion of editors, lead articles can be interpreted as signals of quality that academics can use to allocate their attention and assert the value of their publications. Advances in electronic journal access allow researchers to directly access articles, suggesting article ordering may be less relevant today. We confirm the past importance of lead articles by examining citation rates from published papers as well as the wider source of papers that are listed in Google Scholar. Our findings also confirm using Google Scholar as a citation source provides congruent results to using citations from articles published in ISI-listed journals, with the additional benefit of it potentially being more timely since it includes wider citation sources, inclusive of working and conference papers."
"This paper reports on a bibliometric study of the characteristics and impact of research in the library and information science (LIS) field which was funded through research grant programs, and compares it with research that received no extra funding. Seven core LIS journals were examined to identify articles published in 1998 that acknowledge research grant funding. The distribution of these articles by various criteria (e.g., topic, affiliation, funding agency) was determined. Their impact as indicated by citation counts during 1998-2008 was evaluated against that of articles without acknowledging extra funding and published in the same journals in the same year using citation data collected from Scopus' Citation Tracker. The impact of grant-funded research as measured by citation counts was substantially higher than that of other research, both overall and in each journal individually. Scholars from outside LIS core institutions contributed heavily to grant-funded research. The two highest-impact publications by far reported non-grant-based research, and grant-based funding of research reported in core LIS journals was biased towards the information retrieval (IR) area, particularly towards research on IR systems. The percentage of articles reporting grant-funded research was substantially higher in information-oriented journals than in library-focused ones."
"Retractions solicited by authors following the discovery of an unintentional error-what we henceforth call a ""self-retraction""-are a new phenomenon of growing importance, about which very little is known. Here we present results of a small qualitative study aimed at gaining preliminary insights about circumstances, motivations and beliefs that accompanied the experience of a self-retraction. We identified retraction notes that unambiguously reported an honest error and that had been published between the years 2010 and 2015. We limited our sample to retractions with at least one co-author based in the Netherlands, Belgium, United Kingdom, Germany or a Scandinavian country, and we invited these authors to a semi-structured interview. Fourteen authors accepted our invitation. Contrary to our initial assumptions, most of our interviewees had not originally intended to retract their paper. They had contacted the journal to request a correction and the decision to retract had been made by journal editors. All interviewees reported that having to retract their own publication made them concerned for their scientific reputation and career, often causing considerable stress and anxiety. Interviewees also encountered difficulties in communicating with the journal and recalled other procedural issues that had unnecessarily slowed down the process of self-retraction. Intriguingly, however, all interviewees reported how, contrary to their own expectations, the self-retraction had brought no damage to their reputation and in some cases had actually improved it. We also examined the ethical motivations that interviewees ascribed, retrospectively, to their actions and found that such motivations included a combination of moral and prudential (i.e. pragmatic) considerations. These preliminary results suggest that scientists would welcome innovations to facilitate the process of self-retraction."
"In this exploratory study, we analyze co-authorship networks of collaborative cancer research in India. The complete network is constructed from bibliometric data on published scholarly articles indexed in two well-known electronic databases covering two 6-year windows from 2000 to 2005 and 2006 to 2011 inclusive. Employing a number of important metrics pertaining to the underlying topological structures of the network, we discusses implications for effective policies to enhance knowledge generation and sharing in cancer research in the country. With some modifications, our methods can be applied without difficulty to examine policy structure of related disciplines in other countries of the world."
"e-Research is changing practices and dynamics in social research by the incorporation of advanced e-tools to process data and increase scientific collaboration. Previous research shows a positive attitude of investigators through e-Re search and shows a fast incorporation of e-Tools, in despite of many cultural resistances to the change. This paper examines the current state (attitudes, tools and practices) of e-Research in the field of Media and Communication Studies in Latin America, Spain and Portugal. A total of 316 researchers of the region answered an online survey during the last 2 months of 2011. Findings confirm an optimistic attitude through e-Research and an often use of e-Tools to do research. Even though, most of them informed to use basic e-Tools (e. g. e-mail, commercial videoconference, office software and social networks) instead of advanced technologies to process huge amount of data (e. g. Grid, simulation software and Internet2) or the incorporation to Virtual Research Communities. Some of the researchers said that they had an ""intensive"" (31%) and ""often"" (53%) use of e-Tools, but only 22% stated that their computer capacity was not enough to manage and process data. The paper evidences the gap between e-Research in Communications and e-Research in other disciplines; and makes recommendations for its implementation."
"The Hirsch h-index is widely used to measure a researcher's major publications. It has the advantage of being easy to compute. However, it increases steeply with time and therefore does not allow a comparison of young and mature researchers. We find that if the h-index is divided by the number of decades since publication of the researcher's first paper, the result is statistically constant with age. Then the resulting index can be compared for young and old researchers. Its accuracy is the same as that of the h-index and is as easy to compute as the h-index."
"Collaboration is increasingly important for researchers in all disciplines. Universities and funding bodies tend to prefer projects that involve interdisciplinarity, collaboration between different institutions, and international consortiums. Such projects can yield great benefits, but they also pose particular challenges for certain aspects of research integrity, and particularly for awarding credit and authorship. In this article, we describe and analyze the phenomenon of the ghost collaborator, who is initially fully involved and makes a full contribution to a project's design, but then finds him- or herself excluded from meetings and publications."
"From the very outset of scientific Psychology, psychologists have shown interest for drugs and their effects on behavior. This has given rise to numerous contributions, mostly in the form of Psychopharmacology publications. The aim of this study was to quantitatively evaluate these contributions and compare them with other academic disciplines related to Psychopharmacology. Using the PubMed database, we retrieved information about articles from 15 journals included in the Pharmacology and Pharmacy category of the Journal Citation Reports database for a 21-year period (1987 to 2007). There were 37540 articles which about 52% were represented by 3 journals. About 70% of psychology publications were represented by 2 of these journals. Psychology departments accounted for the 11% of the published papers, which places Psychology third behind Psychiatry and Pharmacology, which contributed to 22.69 and 13% respectively. Psychology contributed to the greatest number of studies in 3 journals, second in 3 and third in 8. This report represents the first effort to explore the contribution of academic Psychology to the multidisciplinary science of psychopharmacology. Although leaders of production of psychopharmacology research were from Psychiatry and Pharmacology, Psychology departments are an important source of studies and thus of knowledge in the field of Psychopharmacology"
"Background: There is a growing interest in evaluating the contents of scientific Psychology journals and therefore, to mark the twenty-fifth anniversary of Psicothema, we aim to provide an insight into its historical evolution. The objective of this study was to carry out a bibliometric analysis of the articles published from 1989 to 2012, in order to provide information regarding different parameters related to production and quality. Method: The data analysed were the evolution of the articles throughout the analysed period, languages of publication, index of authorship, countries according to author affiliation, subject matter, the ten most cited articles, Top Ten journals in which Psicothema is most cited, and the evolution of the Impact Factor, amongst others. Results: A total of 2,163 articles were analysed, of which the majority (96.16%) are original articles, published in Spanish (80.07%) and with predominantly two authors (28.34%). The journal has published work by authors from 32 different countries according to their affiliation. Conclusions: The results support the multidisciplinary character of the journal and a positive and constant evolution towards the advance in Psychology."
"At present, institutional design is an under-theorized and underdeveloped part of the social sciences. In this paper I focus on designs for situations of collective action where the outcome is controlled by the choices of several self-interested actors. In those situations the goal of institutional design is to alter the rules of the game so that self-interested actors find it rational to cooperate. I explore the viability of that definition by considering two examples of institutional design: urban safety and academic peer review. I discuss the implications of my findings for our conception of rational self-interest and propose that three design principles publicity, boundaries, and contiguity - can be inferred from the analysis."
"Publishing research is the final step in the scientific process and is used as the primary means for disseminating research findings to the scientific community. Publishing can embody many personal motivations (e.g., gratification, seeing a finished product in print, desire to further science) for authors as well as professional benefits (e.g., promotion, tenure, future funding opportunities). As the scientific workforce and competition for jobs and funding increase, publishing productivity has become a driving factor for many authors, which may lead to writing practices that violate integrity. In this essay, we discuss writing actions that may be considered a violation of integrity in the context of traditional manuscript sections (introduction and discussion, methods, and results). We define integrity as consistency of actions that reflect honesty and truthfulness. Writing the introduction and discussion can be compared to an artistic creation because the rendition of the data may vary depending on the intentions and experience of the author. Some authors may be tempted to relate their research to a hot topic (e.g., climate change, model selection) in an attempt to increase publication success or maximize visibility in search engines, despite not having sufficient data to support their conclusions. Caution must be taken to not overextend the story beyond the bounds of the data. Modification of the methods and results sections contains the most extreme cases of scientific integrity violations (e.g., changing an alpha level, only presenting positive results, running numerous tests until desired outcome). Manipulation of methods or results is more difficult to detect by peer review. We believe that however destructive integrity violations may be, despite benefits to the author (e.g., accolades, publication, potential citations, promotion, etc.), the individual scientist should hold him- or herself accountable and to a high standard to avoid sacrificing integrity."
"Measuring research output in fields of social sciences and humanities requires particular attention to the specificities of the field, but also to national and cultural contexts. This paper presents an approach adopted in a project constructing an instrument for measuring research output in communication sciences in Switzerland in collaboration with the scientific community. The concept of profiles, allowing combination of output in different dimensions, is central and proved to be fruitful for the discussion of the instrument and its acceptance in the field. Opportunities, challenges and limitations as well as the way in which they were approached and/or overcome are addressed and further steps to be taken are discussed."
"This article reports a 2013 study on the percentage of Open Access (OA) journal articles. Following the 2009 Bjork et al. (2010) model, this study generated 2,655 random sample articles published in 2012 from Scopus. It found that 37.8% of Scopus samples have free full text on the Internet, a significant increase from 20.4% recorded by the Bjork et al. study. Because the vast majority of the 9,900 OA journals listed by DOAJ are not indexed by Scopus, this study projects with caution that human history is reaching a milestone; either the percentage of OA articles published in the previous year is very close to 50% or it has passed that mark."
"The h-index is frequently used to measure the performance of single scientists in Korea (and beyond). No single indicator alone, however, is able to provide a stable and complete assessment of performance. The Stata command bibrep. ado is introduced which automatically produces bibliometric reports for single researchers (senior researchers working in the natural or life sciences). The user of the command receives a comprehensive bibliometric report which can be used in research evaluation instead of the h-index."
"Since early 1960s, there has been a growing interest in the emergence and development of new technologies accompanied by a strong wish from decision makers to govern related processes at the corporate and national levels. One of the key categories that appeared to set up analytical and regulatory frameworks was the 'advanced technology' category. Primarily associated with computer electronics and microelectronics, it soon had new meanings derived from a variety of professional discussions primarily in the social sciences. Later in a new term, 'emerging technologies', appeared to highlight the speed of change in a wide range of promising research areas. This paper focuses on the evolution of academic discussions concerning advanced and emerging technologies in social sciences literature for the period from 1955 until 2015. In order to identify whether studies in these areas constitute separate research fields, the paper studies the evolution of co-citation networks and the centrality characteristics of transitionary references. It was shown that social studies in emerging technologies demonstrate better consistency in background in literature. However, an analysis of transitionary references and their centrality characteristics can hardly confirm the existence of separate research fields in both cases. The suggested method for the identification and tracking of papers mediating ongoing discussions in a selected knowledge network may be helpful in understanding the evolution of weakly conceptualized and growing research areas."
"We discuss the results of a survey conducted in the fall of 2012 and covering 2151 researchers in Germany. We show that there are significant differences between the scientific disciplines with respect to researchers' awareness of, and experience with, both open access (OA) journals and self-archiving. Our results reveal that the relevance of OA within a discipline may explain why researchers from particular disciplines do (not) publish OA. Furthermore, several aspects like copyright law, age, profession or the inherent reward system of a discipline also play a role. Consequently, the paper emphasizes that a ""one-size-fits-all"" approach, as promoted by most recent policy initiatives, is unlikely to provide an effective framework for shaping the future of scholarly publishing."
"Periodically ranking institutional research productivity is necessary not only to understand the status of the development of related fields but also to identify gaps and take appropriate corrective steps. Many bibliometric indicators contribute to the assessment of institutional research productivity, but the appropriateness of the indicator and the relationships between different indicators are topics that have not been addressed. For this reason, an indicator framework for the ranking of institutional research performance, which consists of a count of published articles and quality weighted dimensions, is developed. Based on the literature review, 17 indicators in the framework are chosen for study. Based on these indicators, experiments are conducted to rank Chinese institutions in the field of Information Management. Kendall's tau rank correlation coefficient (tau) is calculated, and all pair wise correlations are between 0.34 and 0.98. There are three primary findings: (1) among the article count indicators, the Straight count indicator is significantly different than others; (2) the rankings based on the indicators which are weighted by quality are consistent with those based on the indicators using article count; and (3) the Paper citation weighted indicator is sensitive to the procedure used for institutional ranking.

"We propose a novel approach to generating a ranking of items in a network (e.g., of web pages connected by links or of articles connected by citations). We transform the network into an exchange economy, and use the resulting competitive equilibrium prices of the network nodes as their ranking. The widely used Google's PageRank comes as a special case when the nodes are represented by Cobb-Douglas utility maximizers. We further use the economic metaphor to combine between the Citation Count and PageRank by imposing a redistributive taxing scheme. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved."
"This paper studies the assignment of responsibility to the participants in the case of coauthored scientific publications. In the conceptual part, we establish that one shortcoming of the full counting method is its incompatibility with the use of additively decomposable citation impact indicators. In the empirical part of the paper, we study the consequences of adopting the address-line fractional or multiplicative counting methods. For this purpose, we use a Web of Science dataset consisting of 3.6 million articles published in the 2005-2008 period, and classified into 5119 clusters. Our research units are the 500 universities in the 2013 edition of the CWTS Leiden Ranking. Citation impact is measured using the Mean Normalized Citation Score, and the Top 10% indicators. The main findings are the following. Firstly, although a change of counting methods alters co-authorship and citation impact patterns, cardinal differences between co-authorship rates and between citation impact values are generally small. Nevertheless, such small differences generate considerable re-rankings between universities. Secondly, the universities that are more favored by the adoption of a fractional rather than a multiplicative approach are those with a large co-authorship rate for the citation distribution as a whole, a small co-authorship rate in the upper tail of this distribution, a large citation impact performance, and a large number of solo publications.

"The percentages of shares of world publications of the European Union and its member states, China, and the United States have been represented differently as a result of using different databases. An analytical variant of the Web-of-Science (of Thomson Reuters) enables us to study the dynamics in the world publication system in terms of the field-normalized top-1% and top-10% most-frequently cited publications. Comparing the EU28, USA, and China at the global level shows a top-level dynamic that is different from the analysis in terms of shares of publications: the United States remains far more productive in the top-1% of all papers; China drops out of the competition for elite status; and the EU28 increased its share among the top-cited papers from 2000 to 2010. Some of the EU28 member states overtook the United States during this decade; but a clear divide remains between EU15 (Western Europe) and the Accession Countries. Network analysis shows that China was embedded in this top-layer of internationally co-authored publications. These publications often involve more than a single European nation.

"Librarians and archivists are intimately involved in scholarly communication systems, both as information providers and instructors. However, very little is known regarding their activities as scholars. This study seeks to examine the scholarly communication practices of librarians and archivists, the role that tenure plays in scholarly communication practices, and the degree to which institutional support is provided in librarians' efforts to consume and disseminate research and reports of best practices. A questionnaire was sent to professional librarians and archivists at 91 ARL institutions. The responses demonstrate that ARL librarians and archivists are avid consumers and creators of scholarship, and they use emerging technologies to stay up-to-date on the profession's latest research."
"Some bibliometric research has been carried out in sport sciences, but compared with other disciplines there is still no intensive study at macro level, especially on international collaboration. This study attempts to observe the status and trend of international collaboration in sport sciences at macro level, and to look at its relationship with academic impact. 20,804 publications from 63 consistently issued journals belonging to the Sport Sciences category in Web of Science database in 2000-2001 and 2010-2011 were analyzed. The main objects include co-authorship links of country pairs, the share of international co-authored publications, tendency and ""affinity"" in collaboration, and citation impact of international publications. Differences between countries and periods were observed. There is a rapid increase of the share of international collaboration in sport sciences. In some countries the share is even above 2/3; Co-authorship networks imply some cultural, political or geographical factors for collaboration, and their changes exhibit some new trends; Selected countries have strong tendency in collaboration; International collaborated publications have a higher performance than domestic ones in citation impact. But gaps between countries are narrowing. International collaboration really intensified in this field. European, especially Nordic countries are very fond of collaboration and have gained outstanding performance as a partner. It is meaningful to further explore the underlying motivation behind international collaboration in sport science research."
"Counts of Mendeley readers may give useful evidence about the impact of published research. Although previous studies have found significant positive correlations between counts of Mendeley readers and citation counts for journal articles, it is not known if this is equally true for conference papers. To fill this gap, Mendeley readership data and Scopus citation counts were extracted for both journal articles and conference papers published in 2011 in four fields for which conferences are important: Computer Science Applications; Computer Software; Building and Construction Engineering; and Industrial and Manufacturing Engineering. Mendeley readership counts correlated moderately with citation counts for both journal articles and conference papers in Computer Science Applications and Computer Software. The correlations were much lower between Mendeley readers and citation counts for conference papers than for journal articles in Building & Construction Engineering and Industrial and Manufacturing Engineering. Hence, there seem to be disciplinary differences in the usefulness of Mendeley readership counts as impact indicators for conference papers, even between fields for which conferences are important."
"In August 2011, Thomson Reuters launched version 5 of the Science and Social Science Citation Index in the Web of Science (WoS). Among other things, the 222 ISI Subject Categories (SCs) for these two databases in version 4 of WoS were renamed and extended to 225 WoS Categories (WCs). A new set of 151 Subject Areas was added, but at a higher level of aggregation. Perhaps confusingly, these Subject Areas are now abbreviated ""SC'' in the download, whereas ""WC'' is used for WoS Categories. Since we previously used the ISI SCs as the baseline for a global map in Pajek (Pajek is freely available at http://vlado.fmf.uni-lj.si/pub/networks/pajek/) (Rafols et al., Journal of the American Society for Information Science and Technology 61:1871-1887, 2010) and brought this facility online (at http://www.leydesdorff.net/overlaytoolkit), we recalibrated this map for the new WC categories using the Journal Citation Reports 2010. In the new installation, the base maps can also be made using VOSviewer (VOSviewer is freely available at http://www.VOSviewer.com/) (Van Eck and Waltman, Scientometrics 84:523-538, 2010)."
"Background: Abstract presentations at scientific congresses are a preparation for publication in peer reviewed journals. The present study aimed to investigate the prediction of abstract acceptance of peer reviewed publications focusing on the difference between male and female first authors. Methods: We evaluated 8411 abstracts submitted to the German Cardiac Society by 2090 females and 6321 male scientists. Abstract grading (3 to 9 reviewers, blinded on a 5-point scale) separated those accepted and rejected followed by a bibliometric analysis of Medline publications from 2006 to 2012. Results: While rating of abstracts was not different between males and females (p = 0.475), publication rate of females was lower compared to males (17.5% vs 24.4 >= %, p < 0.001). Female authors achieved a higher impact factor in their publications (5.1 +/- 0.2 vs 4.4 +/- 0.1, p = 0.0003) and were more often listed on papers in highly ranked journals (impact factor = 5) than males. Although, more accepted abstracts than rejected ones were published in high rank journals, a considerable number of papers were generated from rejected abstracts (22%). Conclusions: Female cardiologists had a better publication success than males concerning high rank peer reviewed publications. Acceptance in blinded abstract evaluation often detects work published later, while rejected contributions still might represent high quality work suitable for publication in peer reviewed journals.

"Researchers are experiencing intense pressures to publish and increase research outputs. Recently many research funders have introduced policies and mandates related to open access, which have contributed to the increasing popularity of open access journals. Dubbed gold open access, open access journals offer researchers another publishing option. However, some publishers with questionable practices and journals of dubious quality have emerged exploiting the 'author pays' open access model and researchers' need to publish. Hence an ability to publish research outputs through the most appropriate outlet for a particular field is crucial for researchers in order to maximise the impact of their research. Notwithstanding the proliferation of open access journals, the literature indicates that some researchers may not have a full understanding of the operations, implications and issues around open access and other publishing issues. This understanding is known as scholarly publishing literacy. With knowledge of scholarly publishing and access to resources and tools, academic libraries and librarians are well-positioned to play an active role in providing support to researchers. This paper argues that scholarly publishing literacy should be treated as an extension of information literacy delivered through a broader research support framework. This paper presents a research librarian's perspective, and draws on literature and the author's practice to illustrate key points. Issues for further investigation are identified."
"The aim of this literature review on scholarly reputation is: (i) to clarify the concept of scholarly reputation; and (ii) to identify the opportunities for scholars (and especially the early career ones among them) to build, maintain and showcase their reputation in today's increasingly open-values based, digital and networked environment. Thus, an in-depth discussion of the notion of scholarly reputation, inclusive of its multi-dimensional sub-constructs and antecedents, is followed by an attempt to establish how it is to be achieved and managed."
"This article provides a citation analysis for faculty from Association of Collegiate Schools of Planning (ACSP) member schools. The article argues that Google Scholar data is a particularly valuable source of citation data for urban planning because its coverage extends beyond traditional peer-reviewed publications. The analysis reports the level of scholarly activity within the urban planning discipline. The results show citation patterns for planning faculty, departments, and universities along with discussing the distribution of citation activity across the discipline. The article concludes by encouraging planning scholars and administrators to undertake more analysis of planning scholarship to understand scholarly performance and impact."
"Little is known about the breadth and depth of scholarly publishing within the field of psychology and its related disciplines originating from Latin American authors. To better define the subject area, we underwent a data analysis to examine the trends (e.g., status, quantity, and quality of publications) of scholarly publications emanating from Latin America origin (i.e., the location of the primary author). Our findings suggest that there has been a swift and steady increase in the quantity of scholarly publications published by Latin American authors. This increase is marked as 880% between 2001 and 2013, with a slight increase in the number of International as opposed to Regional publications. This study reveals that scholarly publications originating from Latin America are on the rise, with anticipated future growth."
"The assessment of individual researchers using bibliometric indicators is more complex than that of a region, country or university. For large scientific bodies, averages over a large number of researchers and their outputs is generally believed to give indication of the quality of the research work. For an individual, the detailed peer evaluation of his research outputs is required and, even this, may fail in the short term to make a final, long term assessment of the relevance and originality of the work. Scientometrics assessment at individual level is not an easy task not only due to the smaller number of publications that are being evaluated, but other factors can influence significantly the bibliometric indicators applied. Citation practices vary widely among disciplines and sub disciplines and this may justify the lack of good bibliometric indicators at individual level. The main goal of this study was to develop an indicator that considers in its calculation some of the aspects that we must take into account on the assessment of scientific performance at individual level. The indicator developed, the h(nf) index, considers the different cultures of citation of each field and the number of authors per publication. The results showed that the h(nf) index can be used on the assessment of scientific performance of individual researchers and for following the performance of a researcher."
"Although software has helped researchers conduct research, little is known of the impact of software on science. To fill this gap, this article proposes an improved bootstrapping method to extract software entities from full-text papers and assess their impact on science. Evaluation results show that the proposed entity extraction system outperforms three baseline methods on extracting software entities from full-text papers. The proposed method is then used to learn software entities from all papers published in PLoS ONE in 2014. More than 2000 unique software entities are obtained which accounted for more than 20,000 mentions and more than 7000 citations. The paper finds that software is commonly used in the scientific community along with a substantial uncitedness. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."
"This article offers a qualitative analysis of research misconduct witnessed by researchers during their careers, either by research students or fellow researchers, when conducting or supervising research in their respective departments. Interviews were conducted with 21 participants from various research backgrounds and with a range of research experience, from selected universities in Malaysia. Our study found that misbehavior such as manipulating research data, misrepresentation of research outcomes, plagiarism, authorship disputes, breaching of research protocols, and unethical research management was witnessed by participants among junior and senior researchers, albeit for different reasons. This indicates that despite the steps taken by the institutions to monitor research misconduct, it still occurs in the research community in Malaysian institution of higher education. Therefore, it is important to admit that misconduct still occurs and to create awareness and knowledge of it, particularly among the younger generation of researchers. The study concludes that it is better for researchers to be aware of the behaviors that are considered misconduct as well as the factors that contribute to misconduct to solve this problem."
"I studied the distribution of changes in journal impact factors (JIF) between 1998 and 2007 according to an empirical beta law with two exponents. Changes in JIFs (CJIF) were calculated as the quotient obtained by dividing the JIF for a given year by the JIF for the preceding year. The CJIFs showed good fit to a beta function with two exponents. In addition, I studied the distribution of the changes in segments of the CJIF rank order. The distributions, which were similar from year to year, could be fitted to a Lorentzian function. The methods used here can be useful to understand the changes in JIFs using relatively simple functions."
"The paper is concerned with analysing what makes a great journal great in the sciences, based on quantifiable Research Assessment Measures (RAM). Alternative RAM are discussed, with an emphasis on the Thomson Reuters ISI Web of Science database (hereafter ISI). Various ISI RAM that are calculated annually or updated daily are defined and analysed, including the classic 2-year impact factor (2YIF), 5-year impact factor (5YIF), Immediacy (or 0-year impact factor (0YIF)), Eigenfactor, Article Influence, C3PO (Citation Performance Per Paper Online), h-index, Zinfluence, PI-BETA (Papers Ignored-By Even The Authors), Impact Factor Inflation (IFI), and three new RAM, namely Historical Self-citation Threshold Approval Rating (H-STAR), 2 Year Self-citation Threshold Approval Rating (2Y-STAR), and Cited Article Influence (CAI). The RAM data are analysed for the 6 most highly cited journals in 20 highly-varied and well-known ISI categories in the sciences, where the journals are chosen on the basis of 2YIF. The application to these 20 ISI categories could be used as a template for other ISI categories in the sciences and social sciences, and as a benchmark for newer journals in a range of ISI disciplines. In addition to evaluating the 6 most highly cited journals in each of 20 ISI categories, the paper also highlights the similarities and differences in alternative RAM, finds that several RAM capture similar performance characteristics for the most highly cited scientific journals, determines that PI-BETA is not highly correlated with the other RAM, and hence conveys additional information regarding research performance. In order to provide a meta analysis summary of the RAM, which are predominantly ratios, harmonic mean rankings are presented of the 13 RAM for the 6 most highly cited journals in each of the 20 ISI categories. It is shown that emphasizing THE impact factor, specifically the 2-year impact factor, of a journal to the exclusion of other informative RAM can lead to a distorted evaluation of journal performance and influence on different disciplines, especially in view of inflated journal self citations."
"Criteria for the evaluation of most scholars' work have recently received wider attention due to high-profile cases of scientific misconduct which are perceived to be linked to these criteria. However, in the competition for career advancement and funding opportunities almost all scholars are subjected to the same criteria. Therefore these evaluation criteria act as 'switchmen', determining the tracks along which scholarly work is pushed by the dynamic interplay of interests of both scholars and their institutions. Currently one of the most important criteria is the impact of publications. In this research, the extent to which publish or perish, a long standing evaluation criterion, led to scientific misconduct is examined briefly. After this the strive for high impact publications will be examined, firstly by identifying the period in which this became an important evaluation criterion, secondly by looking at variables contributing to the impact of scholarly papers by means of a non-structured literature study, and lastly by combining these data into a quantitative analysis."
"The contributions of leading scientists, such as Nobel Prize winners often play an important role in the progress of mankind. In this article, we propose new indices to recognize foundational work in science. Based on case studies of publications by 2016 Nobel Prize winners we make a distinction between two types of fundamental contributions. In a metaphoric way we refer to them as directly igniting or sparking. Our work contains an important message for research evaluation. Besides short-term evaluations it is also important to perform longer term evaluations, otherwise work of Nobel class may fall under the radar and is not rewarded according to its scientific value. It is further suggested that scientometric investigations should not overlook transitional characteristics of scientific progress."
"Black (2012), using a novel citation-type analysis, identified the most frequently cited journals in forensic psychology. The article prompted two pedagogic concerns: the lack of coverage regarding the attributes and limitations of currently available features of citation operations in major databases, and on the expository level, in addressing a specialist vs generalist audience. The current paper addresses these issues and concludes that databases that offer citation options rely on different methods, coverage, and transparency of functions, there can be much variance in citation-search findings based on the type of analysis performed, and the field of bibliometrics is advancing at a torrid pace. Based on these concerns, citation-based findings would best be considered exploratory in nature."
"The aim of this study was to analyze the evolution of the quantity and visibility of Cuban scientific production in Public Health and Medicine to determine if they follow the same patterns of scientific communication and the recommended best practices for publication. Bibliometric indicators of quantity, visibility and cooperation were extracted from the SCImago Institutions Rankings website, which is based on Scopus data, in the field of Medicine and category of Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health from 2003 to 2011. Cuba has a relatively high position in the rankings of scientific production in both Medicine and Public Health within the international and regional contexts, but its impact is ranked among the last countries. The production trend of both fields has increased, but public health is increasing faster. Leadership is high, but international collaboration is below expectations. Publication in high impact journals (first quartile) and articles in the set 10% most cited documents (excellence) are scarce. Thus, it may be concluded that the volume and impact of publication are not in accordance with the scientific potential of Cuban health. We recommend increasing scientific cooperation, publishing articles in high impact journals, training human resources and following the international recommendations for good editorial and scientific publication practices."
"Purpose - This study aims to analyze the productivity patterns of authors in Nigeria using publications indexed in Medline from 2008 to 2012 based on Lotka's Law. Lotka's Law of scientific productivity provides a platform for studying inequality in authors' productivity patterns in a given field and over a specified period. Design/methodology/approach - This study covers all the journal articles on HIV/AIDS pandemic in Nigeria over a period of five years (2008-2012) in Medline, of which 512 articles were reported to have been published during this period. In this paper, 306 articles that had HIV/AIDS in the title, published in 20 journals, and articles that had HIV/AIDS as author keywords were analyzed. Because no local database that indexed biomedical literature from Nigeria was available, Medline was used, which is not only a robust and flexible database that includes articles from Nigeria but is also the largest medical database that indexes over six-and-a-half million articles from 3,400 biomedical journals. Findings - While HIV/AIDS can be considered a global pandemic, Nigeria has the second highest number of new infections reported each year, and an estimated 3.7 per cent of the population is living with the dreaded disease. This study presents a general picture of the distribution of papers as single-author papers, multiple-author papers and the measures of co-authorship. The findings of the study reveal that in the productivity distribution for authors on the subject of HIV/AIDS, only co-authors and non-collaborative authors' categories fit in the Lotka's Law, whereas all-authors and first-author categories differ from the distribution of Lotka's inverse square law. Research limitations/implications - The empirical evidence used in this paper was based on only articles of HIV/AIDS pandemic in Nigeria that had HIV/AIDS the title. Therefore, the findings of this study might not be the generalized to other biomedical research studies. Originality/value - The originality of this paper lies in the fact that the productivity pattern of each of the different author categories on the subject of HIV/AIDS is a first of its kind in the Nigerian context."
"Partnerships can be found in many areas of social and economic life. These arrangements have become particularly prevalent in research and development activities where organizations increasingly seek partners to complement their own technological capabilities. R&D partnerships, however, are fraught with challenges because the conditions for optimum effectiveness and efficiency of cooperation are still not fully understood. Academic partnerships are also very common and offer a fertile ground for investigation. Academic cooperation takes many different forms and results in a wide range of outcomes (Laband and Tollison, 2000). One of the most visible outcomes is co-authored publications (Melin and Persson, 1996). Nowadays, there are extensive data available about both the context of these partnerships and the quality of their outcome. This paper explores the distribution of benefits and losses of co-authorship between scholars with asymmetric background, who cooperate through co-authorship in the publication of academic articles. We distinguish between short-term relative returns (i.e. the increase/decrease in citations of a co-authored article relative to the authors' previous publications) and the long-term ones (i.e. the increase/decrease in citations of articles subsequent to the co-authored piece). While the same variables drive the returns (benefits or losses) of both the junior and the senior co-authors, their long-term returns are driven by markedly different, and somewhat opposing, factors. The effect of the co-authors' resources matters more for the senior than for the junior academic partner. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."
"Peer review is commonly recognized among the cornerstones of the scientific publishing system and, less narrowly, of scientific production in general. Although it plays such a fundamental role, peer review is carried out by academics for free. In other words, if a scientific publication generates revenues and profits-as usually happens for the journal articles accessible behind a paywall-reviewers neither participate in sharing the pie nor enjoy the banquet. Nevertheless, some publishers offer rewards for the peer review activity. Here I delve into the Elsevier's reward scheme and argue that, given how it works, the implicit money value of peer review is likely to be positive for the publisher, but it translates in a real value that is close or equal to zero for the reviewers. Accordingly, I propose an alternative reward scheme that, essentially, reallocate a portion of the two-digit profit rates that main publishers currently achieve."
"Although there is evidence that counting the readers of an article in the social reference site, Mendeley, may help to capture its research impact, the extent to which this is true for different scientific fields is unknown. In this study, we compare Mendeley readership counts with citations for different social sciences and humanities disciplines. The overall correlation between Mendeley readership counts and citations for the social sciences was higher than for the humanities. Low and medium correlations between Mendeley bookmarks and citation counts in all the investigated disciplines suggest that these measures reflect different aspects of research impact. Mendeley data were also used to discover patterns of information flow between scientific fields. Comparing information flows based on Mendeley bookmarking data and cross-disciplinary citation analysis for the disciplines revealed substantial similarities and some differences. Thus, the evidence from this study suggests that Mendeley readership data could be used to help capture knowledge transfer across scientific disciplines, especially for people that read but do not author articles, as well as giving impact evidence at an earlier stage than is possible with citation counts."
"HowOpenIsIt is a guide created by SPARC (Scholarly Publishing and Academic Resources Coalition), PLOS (Public Library of Science), and OASPA (Open Access Scholarly Publishers Association) to describe an array of policies a journal can have in the continuum between ""Open"" and ""Closed."" The OAS Evaluation Tool uses the HowOpenIsIt guide to measure the degree of openness of journals of all kinds with scores between 0 and 100. A total of 1,005 journal samples, both OA and non-OA journals in various languages and from various parts of the world, were evaluated and scored with the OAS Evaluation Tool by a team of information professionals in 2015 based on the policies posted on journals' websites. This article reports the findings of the OAS evaluation."
"This paper aimed to present the profile of the researchers, the pattern of scientific collaboration and the knowledge organization in the area of information science in Brazil. The study covered sex differences, skills by region and type of institution, academic formation, indicators of productivity, relations of co-authorship, interactions with other fields of knowledge, and sectors of application of the researches developed in the area. The survey, covering the period 2000-2010, was based on information from the curricula vitae of the researchers with Research Productivity Grant funded by a government agency and from the Directory of Research Group of the National Council for Scientific and Technological Development. The results revealed that the majority of the researchers are women, both in research and postgraduate; there is a significant regional asymmetry; the studies are concentrated in public universities; the papers are published mainly in national journals with open access; the scientific production follows the same pattern of the areas of humanities, social sciences, and linguistics, literature and arts; there is a tendency of increasing the incidence and extent of co-authored papers; there is interaction with other 20 areas of knowledge, which are directly or indirectly connected, forming a single component that comprises all of them; and 'information and S&T management' followed by 'education' are the main sectors of application of the studies developed by the Brazilian researchers. The study therefore showed an overview of this scientific community seeking to contribute to a better understanding of its characteristics and specificities."
"Background: The paper intends to help scientific authors to make the best choice of journals in which to publish, by describing and comparing journal features in the area of oncology. For this purpose, the authors identified impact factor (IF) ranking, cost options and copyright conditions offered to authors wishing to publish in full open access (OA), subscription-based or hybrid journals. Methods: Data referring to articles published in 2010 by three Italian research institutions (National Institute of Health - Rome (ISS), Regina Elena National Cancer Institute - Rome (IRE), National Cancer Institute - Milan (INT) in journals (78) managed according to different business models, all listed in the Journal Citation Reports, subject category Oncology, were collected and analysed. The journals surveyed were ranked according to IF, position in quartiles, publication charges, usage rights in published articles, self-archiving conditions in OAI-compliant repositories digital archives. Results: Almost half (34) the journals surveyed were included in the first quartile, thus revealing authors' preference for journals with a high IF. The prevalent journal business model was the hybrid formula (based on subscriptions but also offering a paid OA option) with 51 journals, followed by subscription-based only journals accounting for 22, while just 5 full OA journals were identified. In general, no relationship was found between IF and article publication charges, in terms of correspondence between more expensive fees and higher IF. Conclusions: The issue of OA journals as compared with traditional subscription-based journals is highly debated among stakeholders: library administrators facing financial restrictions, authors seeking to locate the best outlet for their research, publishers wishing to increase their revenues by offering journals with wider appeal. Against this background, factors such as the quest for alternatives to high-cost business models, investments in setting up institutional repositories hosting the published versions of articles and efforts to overcome copyright barriers and gain free access to scientific literature are all crucial."
"Since Lawrence in 2001 proposed the open access (OA) citation advantage, the potential benefit of OA in relation to citation impact has been discussed in depth. The methodology to test this postulate ranges from comparing the impact factors of OA journals versus traditional ones, to comparing citations of OA versus non-OA articles published in the same non-OA journals. However, conclusions are not entirely consistent among fields, and two possible explications have been suggested in those fields where a citation advantage has been observed for OA: the early view and the selection bias postulates. In this study, a longitudinal and multidisciplinary analysis of gold OA citation advantage is developed. All research articles in all journals for all subject categories in the multidisciplinary database Web of Science are considered. A total of 1,138,392 articles-60,566 (5.3%) OA articles and 1,077,826 (94.7%) non-OA articles-published in 2009 are analysed. The citation window considered goes from 2009 to 2014, and data are aggregated for the 249 disciplines (subject categories). At journal level, we also study the evolution of journal impact factors for OA and non-OA journals in those disciplines whose OA prevalence is higher (top 36 subject categories). As the main conclusion, there is no generalizable gold OA citation advantage, neither at article nor at journal level."
"The construction of knowledge is a collaborative process that has seen a dramatic growth over recent decades, since almost all research activities now involve increasing numbers of researchers, institutions, disciplines and countries. The present study provides a bibliographic review of the literature on research collaboration and identifies pioneering work on the topic, the types of studies undertaken and the variables analyzed. Several approaches are discussed: the ""classical"" approach, based on bibliometric indicators, which has taken on a new dimension with Social Network Analysis; and quantitative and qualitative approaches, which attempt to investigate the motivations and dynamics of collaborative work. The study of scientific collaboration has been undertaken using a variety of methodologies from different disciplinary perspectives. This was made evident at the Congress ""Scientific collaboration: a multidisciplinary approach"" held at University of Valencia in November 2013, which brought together leading experts on the subject from around Spain. This special issue of Revista Espanola de Documentacion Cientifica contains ten selected papers presented at that event. We conclude this introductory paper by examining the main challenges that research into scientific collaboration should explore."
"Since the publication of the first academic journal in 1665, the number of academic journal titles has grown steadily. In 2001, Mabe and Amin studied the pattern of growth in the number of academic journals worldwide, identifying three key development periods between 1900 and 1996. These three episodes are from 1900 to 1944, from 1944 to 1978, and from 1978 to 1996. The compound annual growth rates for each episode are 3.30, 4.68 and 3.31 % respectively. In this research, we seek to validate these findings, and extend on previous work to analyze journal growth patterns from 1986 to 2013. Our results show academic journals grew at an average rate of 4.7 % from 1986 to 2013, which is very similar to the growth rate during the Big Science period observed in the previous study. Our results also show that academic journals had an estimated 92 % Active rate, and 8 % Inactive rate annually. Out of all Active journals, approximately 43 % have high impact and reach JCR or SJR databases, and 26 % have relatively higher impact and are thus collected in the JCR database. The comparison results of Active/Inactive SJR and JCR journals suggest that lower impact journals have a higher chance to become Inactive than higher impact journals. With the wide use of the Internet in academic science, our results expectedly show that the number of Print-Only journals is gradually decreasing while the number of Online-Only journals is increasing. The growth of Online-Only journals exceeds the growth of Print-Only journals in 2007, and the number of Online-Only journals exceeded the number of Print and Only journals in 2012. More than 30 % Newly Created journals provide Open Access. It is suggested that we are experiencing the second journal boom in history and Internet technology has changed the academic publication system."
"This paper reports results on a bibliometric case study of the long-term development of research organizations, using an internationally leading biomedical institute as example. Using scientometric concepts, small group theory, organizational ecology, and process-based organizational theory, we developed a life cycle based theoretical model for analyzing long-term development of research groups and institutes. Three bibliometric indicators are proposed for growth, activity profile stability, and focus. With these, the research dynamics of the case institute are described. First, overall output growth matches developments internationally in developmental biology and stem cell research, and, in line with this, journal article output increasingly dominates the institute's activity profile. Second, superposed on the overall growth curve, a stepwise development is observed, consisting of long phases of growth and stabilisation. These steps reflect local conditions and events. Historical sources from the Institutes' archive and interviews with the current staff of the institute suggest that the pattern of life cycles reflects a strong influence of pioneering individuals. But once settled, pioneering directors who remain in function for many years delay adaptation of the institutes' mission to field developments. Furthermore, national science policies on PhD training, and on priority areas have influenced the life cycles, as did merging with other institutes. As in a social science case, also in this case study stabilized local conditions lead to adaptation to research field dynamics in a delayed fashion. In the present case stable output periods lasted at most 15 years, when local impulses led to new growth of research output and thus prevented onset of a lifecycle decline. The continued growth in the larger field both promoted and legitimized these local impulses."
"Citation indices just like all quantitative indices are highly selective and do not meet the diversity of scientific research. By way of reactivity they create a reality in itself, which determines scientific practice. The fatal consequence is a narrowing down of the evolution of knowledge to a small spectrum of possible knowledge pratices. This is what this essay tries to demonstrate."
"In July 2015, Wiley surveyed over 170,000 researchers in order to explore peer reviewing experience; attitudes towards recognition and reward for reviewers; and training requirements. The survey received 2,982 usable responses (a response rate of 1.7%). Respondents from all markets indicated similar levels of review activity. However, analysis of reviewer and corresponding author data suggests that US researchers in fact bear a disproportionate burden of review, while Chinese authors publish twice as much as they review. Results show that while reviewers choose to review in order to give back to the community, there is more perceived benefit in interacting with the community of a top-ranking journal than a low ranking one. The majority of peer review training received by respondents has come either in the form of journal guidelines or informally as advice from supervisors or colleagues. Seventy-seven per cent show an interest in receiving further reviewer training. Reviewers strongly believe that reviewing is inadequately acknowledged at present and should carry more weight in their institutions' evaluation process. Respondents value recognition initiatives related to receiving feedback from the journal over monetary rewards and payment in kind. Questions raised include how to evenly expand the reviewer pool, provide training throughout the researcher career arc, and deliver consistent evaluation and recognition for reviewers."
"The purpose of this study is to draw a network among the keywords used in public library studies in the LIS field in Korea using a social network analysis method. To achieve the purpose, this study (i) analyses the keywords used in LIS peer-reviewed journal articles on the subject of public libraries, (ii) finds the important keywords of public library studies based on network perspectives, and (iii) compares the keyword network of public library studies for the most recent five years with the keyword network of public library studies of different time periods. Through a keywords analysis of public library studies, the following research trends have been found: (a) Korean public library studies have mainly focused on management issues; (b) there has been much discussion about library cooperation between public libraries and other kinds of libraries; (c) the subjects of research related to evaluation have been diversified as a result of influence from the fields of management and business; (d) scholars became interested in special users; (e) many studies paid attention to human resources issues in public libraries; (f) there have been many studies that are focused on small libraries; and (g) considerable research has been related to lifelong education, in particular, during 2001-2009. In addition, through comparison of the keyword network of public library studies for the most recent five years and the keyword network of public library studies for different time periods, the researcher finds that (i) keywords have both similarities and differences, and (ii) socio-environmental factors influence the research trends."
"BackgroundGerontological nursing is a highly interdisciplinary specialty. English-language bibliometric research is scarce. ObjectivesStudy gerontological nursing literature to identify journals useful for nurses and researchers working with older adults, help librarians assist gerontological nursing authors to find publication outlets and make library collection decisions. MethodsUsing a combination of methods, the authors identified cited journals in the Journal of Gerontological Nursing (JGN) and Geriatric Nursing (GN) from 2008 to 2010 using part of the Nursing and Allied Health Resources (NAHRS) Sectionprotocol. A list was generated and compared to the results of an earlier unpublished NAHRS study and an earlier review article. A second list was developed following set criteria of bibliometric indicators and journal lists. ResultsZone 1 showed 28 journals, and Zone 2 had 1472 titles. Zone 1 journals were examined further based on the inclusion of certain bibliometrics and journal lists. DiscussionProviding insight into the complementary use comparative review and citation mapping, this study reports an increase in gerontological nursing research from 2008 to 2010 across a diverse group of highly cited journals. ConclusionA list of new journal titles is presented to aid collection development and suggestions of places to publish gerontological research."
"Background: This study represents scientific production of Iran in medical sciences field at recent years, and the correlation between scientific productions with the number of indexed journals. Methods: Data extracted from SCOPUS database between years 2000 and 2011, and Iran?s performance measured in terms of different Scientometrics indexes including self-citations, percent of cited articles, number of articles with international collaboration and contribution of Iran in medical sciences in Middle East and world. Moreover correlation between the number of articles, citations, self-citations, and H-index and number of indexed journals for 50 countries in all fields is included. Results: In 2011 year, Iran contributed 32.77 percent of the Middle East, and accounted for 1.57 percent of the world scientific production. The most frequent document type was original journal article published in English. Retrieved records revealed preferred subject areas, including medicine miscellaneous (14.53 percent of Iran publications in 2011 year). In 2011, according to the number of articles and citations to them, Iran was at 17th and 23th position between 226 countries, respectively. After adjustment for 19708 journals from 50 countries, Iran?s rank based on the number of journals in medical sciences was 24th. Conclusion: The number of indexed journals with number of articles, citations, self-citations, and H-index of each country showed significant correlation (P-value<0.01). In recent years, by favoring quality over quantity of researches, the new rules have proven to be more effective for discriminating Iranian scientific productions."
"Argentina is a dynamic scientific field, dominantly public, having witnessed a three-fold growth in the number of full-time researchers over the past decade and the repatriation of over one thousand researchers that had emigrated in times of crisis. Meanwhile, there has been a simultaneous deepening of the polarization between internationalized scientists and those with a more endogenous orientation. Although autonomous and heteronymous trends coexist throughout the field, segmented scientific circuits have been consolidated revealing the dispute between two types of prestige: one international and the other local/national. In the first part of this article, we analyze the morphology of this double-faceted academic elite, describing its styles of production and circulation. In the second part, we focus on the internationalized profile, by means of an empirical study on the publications considered to be the ""most relevant"" by researchers on the National Scientific and Technical Research Council (CONICET) when seeking for promotion."
"Book reviews play important roles in scholarly communication especially in arts and humanities disciplines. By using Web of Science's Science Citation Index Expanded, Social Sciences Citation Index, and Arts & Humanities Citation Index, this study probed the patterns and dynamics of book reviews within these three indexes empirically during the past decade (2006-2015). We found that the absolute numbers of book reviews among all the three indexes were relatively stable but the relative shares were decreasing. Book reviews were very common in arts and humanities, common in social sciences, but rare in natural sciences. Book reviews are mainly contributed by authors from developed economies such as the USA and the UK. Oppositely, scholars from China and Japan are unlikely to contribute to book reviews."
"Evaluators with expertise in a particular field may have an informational advantage in separating good projects from bad. At the same time, they may also have personal preferences that impact their objectivity. This paper examines these issues in the context of peer review at the US National Institutes of Health. I show that evaluators are both better informed and more biased about the quality of projects in their own area. On net, the benefits of expertise weakly dominate the costs of bias. As such, policies designed to limit bias by seeking impartial evaluators may reduce the quality of funding decisions."
"The widespread use of digital image-processing software to prepare images for publication is a matter of growing unease among journal editors, particularly in the biosciences. Concerned not so much with intentional fraud, but rather with routine and 'innocent' yet inappropriate alteration of digital images, several high-profile science journals have recently introduced guidelines for authors regarding image manipulation, and are implementing in-house forensic procedures for screening submitted images. Such interventions can be seen as an attempt to 'draw a line' for the scientific community regarding acceptable and unacceptable practices in image production. However, in trying to define simple best-practice guidelines for digital image processing, these journals raise - perhaps inadvertently - a number of longstanding ambiguities concerning the role of images in the production and communication of scientific knowledge. This paper draws on recent image-processing guidelines and journal commentaries to analyse four key tensions relating to the production, circulation and interpretation of digital images in scientific publications. By examining where and how journal editors are drawing lines with respect to image-making practices, this case study explores how trust, the distribution of authority and accountability, and the nature of objectivity are being (re-)negotiated in the digital age."
"OBJECTIVES: To review trends and issues in publishing and provide resources on publishing opportunities for oncology nurses. DATA SOURCES: Journal articles, publishers' information for authors, online publishing resources, discussions with journal and textbook editors, personal experience. CONCLUSION: Advances in oncology practice and publishing present new opportunities-as well as new challenges-for nurse authors. Nurses need to stay abreast of developments in oncology and be aware of trends and issues in publishing, including the emergence of publications with predatory practices. IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING PRACTICE: To maintain the integrity of the oncology nursing knowledge base, nurse authors need to adhere to defined authorship criteria, disclose conflicts of interest, submit their work to reputable publishers that conduct a peer review of submissions, develop the skills needed to serve as reviewers and editors, and mentor the next generation of nurse authors."
"Objective: The quantity and quality of publications in critical care medicine from East Asia haven't been reported. This study aimed to investigate the contribution of publications from East Asia. Methods: Articles from China, Japan and South Korea in 2005 to 2014 were retrieved from Web of Science and Pubmed. The number of publications, impact factor, citation, and article types were analyzed. Results: There were 3076 publications from East Asia (1720 from China, 913 from Japan, and 443 from South Korea). There were a significant decrease in publications from Japan (p = 0.024) and significant increases from China (p = 0.000) and South Korea (p = 0.009). From 2006, the number of articles from China exceed Japan. China had the highest total impact factor (6618.48) and citation (18416), followed by Japan (4566.03; 15440) and South Korea (1998.19; 5599). Japan had the highest mean impact factor (5.00) and citations (16.91), followed by South Korea (4.51; 12.64) and China (3.85; 10.71). Conclusions: China and South Korea's contributions to critical care medicine had significant increases during the past 10 years, while Japan had a significant decrease. China was the most productive region in East Asia since 2006. Japan had the highest quality research output."
"Background and Purpose: The journal Periodicum biologorum is the first Croatian journal in the field of biological sciences which has been published regularly since 1886 and which has had the leading role in conveying scientific information in the field of biology in Croatia. The bibliometric analysis of the content of this journal in time span 1886-2010 provided an insight into the structure of scientific communication in the field of biology in Croatia with a purpose to present trends and development of specific biological disciplines. Materials and Methods: The analysed sample consists of 1,347 articles classified into eight biological disciplines and 40 subdisciplines over a 122-year period, 1886-2010. In order to provide easier assessment of the development of biological sciences and presenting results, the publishing period of journal has been divided into functional periods. Results and Conclusion: Since the beginning of its publication until the 1950s, the fields of study predominant in the journal involved classic biological disciplines of zoology and botany, i.e. their mostly descriptive subdisciplines. From the 1970s onwards, biological disciplines and subdisciplines in the journal have been developed in accordance to global trends, with domination of experimental fields of molecular biology, immunology, physiology etc. Despite the fact that research was conducted only with a purpose to enhance the development of biological sciences in Croatia, this journal also presents an important communication media in biomedical disciplines and subdisciplines. A detailed scientometric analysis might help the journal editorial board to reach decisions concerning journal's future development more easily."
"The consolidation of the scientific publishing industry has been the topic of much debate within and outside the scientific community, especially in relation to major publishers' high profit margins. However, the share of scientific output published in the journals of these major publishers, as well as its evolution over time and across various disciplines, has not yet been analyzed. This paper provides such analysis, based on 45 million documents indexed in the Web of Science over the period 1973-2013. It shows that in both natural and medical sciences (NMS) and social sciences and humanities (SSH), Reed-Elsevier, Wiley-Blackwell, Springer, and Taylor & Francis increased their share of the published output, especially since the advent of the digital era (mid-1990s). Combined, the top five most prolific publishers account for more than 50% of all papers published in 2013. Disciplines of the social sciences have the highest level of concentration (70% of papers from the top five publishers), while the humanities have remained relatively independent (20% from top five publishers). NMS disciplines are in between, mainly because of the strength of their scientific societies, such as the ACS in chemistry or APS in physics. The paper also examines the migration of journals between small and big publishing houses and explores the effect of publisher change on citation impact. It concludes with a discussion on the economics of scholarly publishing."
"We compare estimates for past institutional research performances coming from two bibliometric indicators to the results of the UK's Research Assessment Exercise which last took place in 2008. We demonstrate that a version of the departmental h-index is better correlated with the actual results of that peer-review exercise than a competing metric known as the normalised citation-based indicator. We then determine the corresponding h-indices for 2008-2013, the period examined in the UK's Research Excellence Framework (REF) 2014. We place herewith the resulting predictions on the arXiv in advance of the REF results being published (December 2014). These may be considered as unbiased predictions of relative performances in that exercise. We will revisit this paper after the REF results are available and comment on the reliability or otherwise of these bibliometrics as compared with peer review."
"The data reference in the field of library and information has very important influence on the application and management of various periodicals. The standardized management of data citation has a direct impact on the efficiency of various kinds of document management in Chinese academia. In this paper, firstly the status of data reference behavior in the field of library and information and the degree of standardization of data reference behavior in the library and information field were investigated, then, on the method of applying fuzzy comprehensive evaluation, the reference behavior of data in the field of library and information was evaluated and analyzed, finally, the direction of the standardization of data citation in the field of books and information in books was summarized, so as to provide some reference for the standardized management of data citation behavior."
"The increasing unethical practices of graduates' admissions have heightened concerns about the integrity of the academy. This article informs this important subject that affects the students, admission systems, and the entire scientific community, thus, representing an approach against scholarly black market activities including falsified documents and unethical practices by consultants and students' recruitment agencies."
"Recently there is increasing interest in university rankings. Annual rankings of world universities are published by QS for the Times Higher Education Supplement, the Shanghai Jiao Tong University, the Higher Education and Accreditation Council of Taiwan and rankings based on Web visibility by the Cybermetrics Lab at CSIC. In this paper we compare the rankings using a set of similarity measures. For the rankings that are being published for a number of years we also examine longitudinal patterns. The rankings limited to European universities are compared to the ranking of the Centre for Science and Technology Studies at Leiden University. The findings show that there are reasonable similarities between the rankings, even though each applies a different methodology. The biggest differences are between the rankings provided by the QS-Times Higher Education Supplement and the Ranking Web of the CSIC Cybermetrics Lab. The highest similarities were observed between the Taiwanese and the Leiden rankings from European universities. Overall the similarities are increased when the comparison is limited to the European universities."
"The basic concepts and equations of the progressive nucleation mechanism (PNM) are presented first for the growth and decay of items. The mechanism is then applied to describe the cumulative citations L and citations Delta L per year of the individual most-cited papers i of four selected Polish professors as a function of citation duration t. It was found that the PNM satisfactorily describes the time dependence of cumulative citations L of the papers published by different authors with sufficiently high citations Delta L, as represented by the highest yearly citations Delta L (max) during the entire citation period t (normal citation behavior). The citation period for these papers is less than 15 years and it is even 6-8 years in several cases. However, for papers with citation periods exceeding about 15 years, the growth behavior of citations does not follow the PNM in the entire citation period (anomalous citation behavior), and there are regions of citations in which the citation data may be described by the PNM. Normal and anomalous citation behaviors are attributed, respectively, to the occurrence and nonoccurrence of stationary nucleation of citations for the papers. The PNM also explains the growth and decay of citations Delta L per year of papers exhibiting normal citation behavior."
"In retrospect, the Web appears a very natural development, a byproduct of the growth of the information and communication technologies (ICI) sector. Still, the success of the Web was actually attained through a series of fundamental misunderstandings about the direction that various technologies would take, and how society would use them. It was a tool that happened to be ""good enough"" to meet some urgent needs, but not ideal. A brief survey of the history and pre-history of the Web is presented, with an emphasis on its economics and the many misleading notions that played key roles in its development. This survey leads to some speculative thoughts about the future of the Web. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."
"The most relevant indicators of a scientific system, i.e., human resources, infrastructure, finances and output are analyzed in order to review the current dynamics of the Venezuelan scientific community. During the first half of the 20(th) century, Venezuela had no major organized institutional scientific activity. From 1954 thru 1983, a considerable number of research and development institutions were built within the public sector the major provider of funds. While the current scientific workforce in Venezuela is 0.61 active researchers per 10000 inhabitants, a demographic analysis reveals that it is aging at a fast pace; more scientists abandoning the profession than new ones joining in. The number of publications per researcher has declined rapidly after peaking in 1993, reaching its lowest value ever last year While some systemic parameters, such as infrastructure or number of researchers Or publications in indexed periodicals show pyrrhic increments (4-7%), official figures for number of researchers or investment claim increments by several folds in recent years. Either the scientific system is not efficient or funding is not reaching the laboratories. In any case; as long as the rate of growth of crucial parameters such as number of scientists and research output stays near the country's vegetative growth, existing gaps in S&T between Venezuela and other nations will not be reduced. Overall, it appears that science in Venezuela is in peril. This ought to be a matter of concern, since the present generation of researchers and academics in Venezuela could have been amongst the most significant accomplishments of its democracy."
"OBJECTIVES: Academic metrics can be used to compare the productivity of researchers. We aimed to use a variety of bibliometric parameters to assess the productivity of neurosurgeons working in the United Kingdom. METHODS: Neurosurgical consultants working in the United Kingdom were identified using the Society of British Neurosurgeons' Audit Programme website. Baseline data collected included year of entry to specialist register, academic position and award of higher degree. Google Scholar was used to compute a range of academic metrics for each consultant including the h-index, hi-norm, e-index and g-index. Non-parametric tests were used to compare median results. RESULTS: Median metrics for the whole cohort were: h-index (5), hi-norm (3), g-index (10.4) and e-index (9). The top 3 units based on h-index were Addenbrookes (13), Great Ormond Street (12.5) and Queen's Square (11.5). The h-index correlated with academic position [Prof (17.5), Senior Lecturer (10.5) and non-academic (5); P < 0.0001], higher degree [PhD (10), MD (6) and none (4.5); P < 0.0001] and consultant experience [> 10 year (7), < 10 years (4); P < 0.0001]. No difference was found based on gender [male (5), female (4); P = 0.12]. The same trends were seen across the following other metrics: hi-norm, e-index and g-index. DISCUSSION: This study details the academic impact of United Kingdom-based neurosurgeons through the analysis of a number of citation metrics. It provides a benchmark bibliometric profile and we advocate future comparative assessments as a means to assess impact of and guide academic policy."
"Unlike Impact Factors (IF), Article Influence (AI) scores assign greater weight to citations that appear in highly cited journals. The natural sciences tend to have higher citation rates than the social sciences. We might therefore expect that relative to IF, AI overestimates the citation impact of social science journals in subfields that are related to (and presumably cited in) higher-impact natural science disciplines. This study evaluates that assertion through a set of simple and multiple regressions covering seven social science disciplines: anthropology, communication, economics, education, library and information science, psychology, and sociology. Contrary to expectations. AI underestimates 5IF (five-year Impact Factor) for journals in science-related subfields such as scientific communication, science education, scientometrics, biopsychology, and medical sociology. journals in these subfields have low AI scores relative to their 5IF values. Moreover, the effect of science-related status is considerable typically 0.60 5IF units or 0.50 SD. This effect is independent of the more general finding that AI scores underestimate 5IF for higher-impact journals. It is also independent of the very modest curvilinearity in the relationship between AI and 5IF. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."
"This study aims to apply the concepts of power and love, from the perspective of the Canadian author Adam Kahane to the dialogue between Alexandre Rodrigues Ferreira (XVIII century) and Emilio Goeldi (XIX century), researchers from different eras. In this perspective, we will analyze the appropriation of the texts of Alexandre Rodrigues Ferreira by Emilio Goeldi, which resulted in a new intellectual output by the second, in which a relationship between love and generative power is found. In the scenario of the two authors cited (Alexandre Rodrigues Ferreira and Emilio Goeldi), the making sense occurs through a process that is built by new concepts, acquired cumulatively, allowing a perspective different from that previous one. The idea of sharing and negotiation of meanings permeates the texts produced by the mentioned authors. The way Kahane faces and solves complex social problems, reconciling, in practice, the concepts of power and love, developed by him, the students of Information Science and other sciences, call interdisciplinarity."
"Background Tuberculosis (TB) research is a key component of the End TB Strategy. To track research output, we conducted a bibliometric analysis of TB research from the past decade. Methods The Web of Science database was searched for publications from January 2007 to December 2016 with ""tuberculosis"" in the title. References were analysed using the R bibliometrix package. A year-stratified 5% random subset was drawn to extract funding sources and identify research areas. Findings The annual growth rate of publications was 7.3%, and was highest (13.1%) among Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa (BRICS). The USA was the most productive country, with 18.4% of references, followed by India (9.7%), China (7.3%), England (6.5%), and South Africa (3.9%). In the subset analysis, the most common research area was 'fundamental research' (33.8%). Frequently acknowledged funders were US and EU-based, with China and India emerging as top funders. Collaborations appeared more frequently between high-income countries and low/medium income countries (LMICs), with fewer collaborations among LMICs. Conclusion The past decade has seen a continued increase in TB publications. While USA continues to dominate research output and funding, BRICS countries have emerged as major research producers and funders. Collaborations among BRICS would enhance future TB research productivity."
"The paper asks to what extent the top 200 universities in scientific publishing in four research fields are the same universities that occupy the top 200 positions in global university rankings. In this article, the top 200 lists of universities in scientific publishing are compiled of universities' contribution rates in four fields: biological, physical, social and life sciences. Out of some 4000 academic institutions included in InCites, the paper identifies 437 top publishing universities in at least one field. The paper analyses the extent to which those universities are covered in six global university rankings' top 200 listings: Academic Ranking of World Universities (ARWU), Performance Ranking of Scientific Papers for World Universities (NTU), QS World University Rankings (QS), Times Higher Education World University rankings (THE), University Ranking by Academic Performance (URAP) and US News and World Report Best Global University Rankings (USNWR). Out of these rankings, URAP, NTU and USNWR are more distinctive than ARWU, QS and THE in covering the 437 top publishing universities in their top 200 listings. Therefore URAP, NTU and USNWR are utilized in analyzing top publishing universities' chances to be recognized. The paper identifies a total of 64 top publishing universities in at least three out of four fields recognized without exception in the top 200 lists of NTU, URAP and USNWR; out of them 24 reside in the USA, 21 in the EU and 19 in the rest of the World. In addition, the paper identifies other (373) top publishing universities variably recognized by the relevant of the three rankings (in terms of odds) depending on the fields in which the universities reach the top 200; odds range from 0.01 (biological sciences) to 12.00 (life, social and biological sciences). The region of residence of these 373 universities also varies, so that those reaching the top 200 in life sciences reside most frequently in the EU, those reaching the top 200 in social sciences in the USA and those reaching the top 200 in physical or in biological sciences in the rest of the World."
"A discipline such as business and management (B&M) is very broad and has many fields within it, ranging from fairly scientific ones such as management science or economics to softer ones such as information systems. There are at least three reasons why it is important to identify these sub-fields accurately. First, to give insight into the structure of the subject area and identify perhaps unrecognised commonalities; second, for the purpose of normalising citation data as it is well-known that citation rates vary significantly between different disciplines. And third, because journal rankings and lists tend to split their classifications into different subjects-for example, the Association of Business Schools list, which is a standard in the UK, has 22 different fields. Unfortunately, at the moment these are created in an ad-hoc manner with no underlying rigour. The purpose of this paper is to identify possible sub-fields in B&M rigorously based on actual citation patterns. We have examined 450 journals in B&M, which are included in the ISI Web of Science and analysed the cross-citation rates between them enabling us to generate sets of coherent and consistent sub-fields that minimise the extent to which journals appear in several categories. Implications and limitations of the analysis are discussed."
"Background: Universities have begun deploying public Internet systems that allow for easy search of their experts, expertise, and intellectual networks. Deployed first in biomedical schools but now being implemented more broadly, the initial motivator of these research networking systems was to enable easier identification of collaborators and enable the development of teams for research. Objective: The intent of the study was to provide the first description of the usage of an institutional research ""social networking"" system or research networking system (RNS). Methods: Number of visits, visitor location and type, referral source, depth of visit, search terms, and click paths were derived from 2.5 years of Web analytics data. Feedback from a pop-up survey presented to users over 15 months was summarized. Results: RNSs automatically generate and display profiles and networks of researchers. Within 2.5 years, the RNS at the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF) achieved one-seventh of the monthly visit rate of the main longstanding university website, with an increasing trend. Visitors came from diverse locations beyond the institution. Close to 75% (74.78%, 208,304/278,570) came via a public search engine and 84.0% (210 out of a sample of 250) of these queried an individual's name that took them directly to the relevant profile page. In addition, 20.90% (214 of 1024) visits went beyond the page related to a person of interest to explore related researchers and topics through the novel and networked information provided by the tool. At the end of the period analyzed, more than 2000 visits per month traversed 5 or more links into related people and topics. One-third of visits came from returning visitors who were significantly more likely to continue to explore networked people and topics (P<.001). Responses to an online survey suggest a broad range of benefits of using the RNS in supporting the research and clinical mission. Conclusions: Returning visitors in an ever-increasing pool of visitors to an RNS are among those that display behavior consistent with using the tool to identify new collaborators or research topics. Through direct user feedback we know that some visits do result in research-enhancing outcomes, although we cannot address the scale of impact. With the rapid pace of acquiring visitors searching for individual names, the RNS is evolving into a new kind of gateway for the university."
"The organisation of cancer research is critical to its overall creativity and productivity. Cancer centres are a major organisational structure for this research, however, little is known about their effect on research or how national policy-making intersects with this complex policy nexus. This study of the evolution of United Kingdom cancer centres (UKCC), part of a wider European and United States programme, uses a bibliometric analysis of research activity prior to the creation of the NCRI and after its formation (1995-2004/5). In terms of critical research mass UKCC are very heterogeneous with a fourfold difference between the top and bottom quintiles. UK centres published just over one eighth of the total UKCC in 1995 but almost a quarter by 2004. This centrification occurred in the absence of any national strategy. Overall these centres conduct more fundamental (laboratory-based) research than that being conducted in the wider network but this hides major heterogeneity. UKCC collaborate with European investigators in 5-28% of all their outputs and with USA the range is between 6% and 21%. We have also derived new measures of research impact on clinical management and the general public as well as the impact of national policy on research assessment for certain types of cancer research.

"The European Journal of Operational Research (EJOR) published its first issue in 1977. This paper presents a general overview of the journal over its lifetime by using bibliometric indicators. We discuss its performance compared to other journals in the field and identify key contributing countries/institutions/authors as well as trends in research topics based on the Web of Science Core Collection database. The results indicate that EJOR is one of the leading journals in the area of operational research (OR) and management science (MS), with a wide range of authors from institutions and countries from all over the world publishing in it. Graphical visualization of similarities (VOS) provides further insights into how EJOR links to other journals and how it links researchers across the globe. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

"We aimed to assess which factors correlate with collaborative behavior and whether such behavior associates with scientific impact (citations and becoming a principal investigator). We used the R index which is defined for each author as log(N-p)/log(I-1), where I-1 is the number of co-authors who appear in at least I-1 papers written by that author and N-p are his/her total papers. Higher R means lower collaborative behavior, i.e. not working much with others, or not collaborating repeatedly with the same co-authors. Across 249,054 researchers who had published >= 30 papers in 2000-2015 but had not published anything before 2000, R varied across scientific fields. Lower values of R (more collaboration) were seen in physics, medicine, infectious disease and brain sciences and higher values of R were seen for social science, computer science and engineering. Among the 9,314 most productive researchers already reaching N-p >= 30 and I-1 >= 4 by the end of 2006, R mostly remained stable for most fields from 2006 to 2015 with small increases seen in physics, chemistry, and medicine. Both US-based authorship and male gender were associated with higher values of R (lower collaboration), although the effect was small. Lower values of R (more collaboration) were associated with higher citation impact (h-index), and the effect was stronger in certain fields (physics, medicine, engineering, health sciences) than in others (brain sciences, computer science, infectious disease, chemistry). Finally, for a subset of 400 U.S. researchers in medicine, infectious disease and brain sciences, higher R (lower collaboration) was associated with a higher chance of being a principal investigator by 2016. Our analysis maps the patterns and evolution of collaborative behavior across scientific disciplines."
"This study explores the usefulness of full-text retrieval in assessing obliteration by incorporation (OBI) by comparing patterns of OBI and citation substitution across economics, management, and psychology for two concept catch phrasesbounded rationality and satisficing. Searches using each term are conducted in JSTOR and in selected additional full-text journal sources from over the years 1987-2011. Two measures of OBI are used, one simply tallying the presence or absence of references to Simon's oeuvre (strict OBI) linked to the catch phrase and one counting only papers lacking any embedded reference as evidence of obliteration (lenient OBI). By either measure, OBI existed but varied across subject area, time period, and catch phrase. Economics had the highest strict OBI (82%) and lenient OBI (43%) for bounded rationality and the highest strict OBI (64%) for satisficing; all 3 subject areas were essentially tied for lenient OBI at about 30%. Sixty-two percent of the articles for bounded rationalitypsychology were retrieved only because the catch phrase occurred in a title in the article bibliography. OBI research can benefit from full-text searching; the main tradeoff is more detailed and nuanced evidence concerning OBI existence and trends versus increased noise in the retrieval."
"In scientific publications, laboratory and clinical images are part of the evidence on which authors base the interpretation and conclusions of their research. However, variability in biology, image acquisition and quality, standards for interpretation, training and experience of evaluators, and presence of artifacts can markedly reduce interrater and intrarater reliability. This variability in interpretation suggests that authors should support their claims with complete information about the image on which those claims are based. Yet, without appropriate guidelines, the documentation of these published images almost certainly will be incomplete and inconsistent. Here, we propose six principles for documenting clinical and laboratory images in publications: the clinical and laboratory images in publications (CLIP) principles. The principles were inspired by the CONSORT (Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials) and related initiatives that are intended to improve the documentation of research through the use of guidelines. However, the CLIP principles are not formal guidelines, standards, or requirements but, rather, reminders about the information that may be needed to support interpretations and conclusions based on images. These principles organize the self-evident factors related to the nature, acquisition, reporting, and presentation of clinical and laboratory images. As imaging technologies become more complex, however, so too does the specific information needed to document how specific types of images are acquired. Thus, in addition to general direction for all authors, the CLIP principles give journals and professional societies a foundation, a direction, and some models to assist them in developing technology-specific guidelines for reporting the images common in their area of practice.

"A frequently used measure of scientific (or research) collaboration is co-authorship in scholarly publications. Less frequently used are joint grant proposals and patents. Many scholars believe that the use of co-authorship as the sole measure of research collaboration is insufficient because collaboration between researchers might not result in co-authorship. Collaborations involve informal communication (i.e., conversational exchange) between researchers. Using self-reports from 100 tenured/tenure-track faculty in the College of Engineering at the University of South Florida, researchers' networks are constructed from their communication relationships and also from collaborations in three areas: joint publications, joint grant proposals, and joint patents. The data collection: (1) covers both researchers' in-progress and completed collaborative outputs, (2) yields a rating from the researchers on the importance of a relationship to them and (3) obtains multiple types of relationship ties between researchers allowing for the comparison of multiple networks. Exponential random graph models (ERGMs) results show that the more communication researchers have the more likely they produce collaborative outputs. Furthermore, we find that joint grant proposals tend to have mixed gender teams and that researchers of the same race are more likely to publish together, but those demographic attributes have no additional explanatory power regarding joint patents.

"This paper examines the intellectual structure of evaluation by means of citation analysis. By using various article attributes and citation counts in Google Scholar and (Social) Science Citation Index Web of Science, we analyze all articles published in Evaluation and Program Planning from 2000 until 2012. We identify and discuss the characteristics and development of the field as reflected in the history of those citations. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."
"[Roberto Casati, Gloria Origgi, Judith Simon (CC-BY-SA)] Purpose - New technologies allow for efficient dissemination of scientific knowledge objects (SKOs). Yet they are likely to transform SKOs as well. The aim of this paper is to propose a way to structure SKOs that allows for both a clear individuation of the main scientific contributions and a fine-grained structure of credits and evaluation. Design/methodology/approach - The authors review and analyze existing practices of structuring SKOs in different disciplines. Findings - Provisionally considering the published paper as an atomic SKO, possible subatomic structures of SKOs are investigated. It is hypothesized that SKOs are meant to satisfy two separated but interdependent sets of constraints, one related to the contribution the SKO makes to the body of knowledge, and another related to the contribution the SKO makes to the reputation of its authors. It is hypothesized that existing SKO structures are not optimal for satisfying both sets of constraints at once. Research limitations/implications - A broader analysis may be needed that covers the totality of existing practices. Practical implications - Guidelines are offered. This paper, including the present abstract, is an example of what the scientific paper of tomorrow could be like. Social implications - The paper proposes better apportioning of scientific credits and evaluation; substantive evolution of the academic publishing and credit attribution models. Originality/value - The idea that the communication and evaluation function of a SKO are differently reflected in their structure is novel. The proposed fine-grained credit attribution system is novel. The molecular/atomic/sub-atomic distinction is a new way to fix the terminology."
"The US National Institutes of Health (NIH) supports basic and applied biomedical research by funding grants and contracts. To measure the outcomes and impact of their programs, NIH staff conduct program evaluations and undertake targeted investigations of research portfolios. Recently, the NIH launched the electronic scientific portfolio assistant (eSPA), a web-based analytics system based on linked scientific databases that provides quantitative information for program officers and planning and evaluation officials managing research portfolios. This system has improved the ability to create and collaboratively refine research portfolios, has reduced the time needed to collect and link outcomes data such as publications and patents, and is providing information used to support research management decisions. After describing the eSPA system, we provide examples of three eSPA evaluation projects that illustrate the impact of this system on NIH evaluation objectives."
"One essential component in the construction of patent landscapes in biomedical research and development (R&D) is identifying the most seminal patents. Hitherto, the identification of seminal patents required subject matter experts within biomedical areas. In this article, we report an analytical method and tool, Patent Citation Spectroscopy (PCS), for the online identification of landmark patents in user-specified areas of biomedical innovation. Using USPTO data, PCS mines the cited references within large sets of patents at the internet and provides an estimate of the historically most impactful prior work. We show the efficacy of PCS in three case studies of biomedical innovation with clinical relevance: (1) RNA interference (RNAi), (2) cholesterol and (3) cloning. PCS mined and analyzed cited references related to patents on RNA interference and correctly identified the foundational patent of this technology, as independently reported by subject matter experts on RNAi intellectual property. Secondly, we apply PCS to a broad set of patents dealing with cholesterol - a case study chosen to reflect a more general, as opposed to expert, patent search query. PCS mined through cited references and identified the seminal patent as that for Lipitor, the groundbreaking medication for treating high cholesterol as well as the pair of patents underlying Repatha. The final case study, cloning, highlights some of the advantages conferred by the PCS methodology in identifying seminal patents. These cases suggest that PCS provides a useful method for identifying seminal patents in areas of biomedical innovation and therapeutics. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."
"The development, current status and dynamics of research in biology related domains in Venezuela is examined through the study of demographic, academic distribution, scientific output and productivity, for two sets of investigators that fit a profile outlined for life sciences researchers or scientists. The first group corresponds to biologists extracted from the ranks of the official Program for the Promotion of Researchers (PPI), the other, pulled out from those that publish in biologically oriented journals, indexed by the Institute of Scientific Information (ISI). Both sets of biology scientists, PPI researchers or Web of Science/ISI scientists, show similar characteristics. The number (absolute and relative) of PPI member that are supposedly dedicated to biological research but do not publish in ISI indexed journals was found to be very similar to the number of supposedly non biologist members of the PPI Program that do publish biological articles in ISI indexed journals. There is also an ongoing feminization process, of academic hierarchies. Female biologists predominate in lower academic ranks and in research cadres, as many as 70% in some areas of biology. This contrasts with the pattern of male predominance observed during the second half of twentieth century in the country. Productivity of Venezuelan biologists seems to depend on gender; men are more productive that their female counterparts. From the bibliometric standpoint, it is found that, on average, 30% of all publications produced in the country are related to biology (or life sciences). The Venezuelan biologists network qualifies neither as a 'Small World' nor it follows the 'Scale Free' model. Finally, in a country rich in renewable natural resources, it seems that the Venezuelan community of researchers in biology is in decline, despite the fact that they constitute its most productive group of investigators."
"A two-step cluster analysis was performed on the absolute downloads and the relative downloads of Chinese journal papers published between 2006 and 2008. Four patterns were identified from the perspective of absolute downloads; the first three patterns can be expressed as power functions, signifying their evident aging trends, although this does not apply to pattern 4. Two patterns were identified from the perspective of relative downloads, and both present power distributions with minor differences in decline speed. Furthermore, we delved into the relationships between total downloads and article features in varying patterns and found that there are only weak correlations between total downloads and title length, number of authors, and number of keywords. However, there are moderate to high correlations between initial downloads-defined as downloads made during the first year after publication-and total downloads, suggesting that it is possible to forecast total downloads according to initial downloads. Additionally, it was found that total instances of highly downloaded papers have no correlations with article features."
"Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to cam, out a bibliometric analysis of the development of Chinese research in superconductivity since the advent of high-temperature superconductivity (HTS) in the mid-1980s, and to compare Chinese research with that of its international competitors. Design/methodology/approach - This research used publications, citations, journals, subject categories and institutional data from the Web of Science database. Findings - Chinese HTS research has grown steadily in importance over the period, with a significant increase in peer-recognition, as measured by citations from non-Chinese researchers. A comparison with superconductivity research in England, France, Germany, Japan, Russia and the USA shows that the impact of the Chinese work is growing relative to the other countries, with a cluster analysis showing that the current bibliometric status of Chinese research is most similar to that of England, France and Russia. Originality/value - This is both the first bibliometric study of Chinese research in superconductivity and the first bibliometric comparison of different countries' research in superconductivity since the advent of HTS. Cluster analysis provides an interesting way of identifying analogous international bibliometric profiles."
"Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to show how bibliometrics would benefit from a stronger programme of construct validity. Design/methodology/approach - The value of the construct validity concept is demonstrated by applying this approach to the evaluation of the h-index, a widely used metric. Findings - The paper demonstrates that the h-index comprehensively fails any test of construct validity. In simple terms, the metric does not measure what it purports to measure. This conclusion suggests that the current popularity of the h-index as a topic for bibliometric research represents wasted effort, which might have been avoided if researchers had adopted the approach suggested in this paper. Research limitations/implications - This study is based on the analysis of a single bibliometric concept. Practical implications - The conclusion that the h-index fails any test in terms of construct validity implies that the widespread use of this metric within the higher education sector as a management tool represents poor practice, and almost certainly results in the misallocation of resources. Social implications - This paper suggests that the current enthusiasm for the h-index within the higher education sector is misplaced. The implication is that universities, grant funding bodies and faculty administrators should abandon the use of the h-index as a management tool. Such a change would have a significant effect on current hiring, promotion and tenure practices within the sector, as well as current attitudes towards the measurement of academic performance. Originality/value - The originality of the paper lies in the systematic application of the concept of construct validity to bibliometric enquiry."
"Chemistry researchers are frequently evaluated on the perceived significance of their work with the citation count as the most commonly-used metric for gauging this property. Recent studies have called for a broader evaluation of significance that includes more nuanced bibliometrics as well as altmetrics to more completely evaluate scientific research. To better understand the relationship between metrics and peer judgements of significance in chemistry, we have conducted a survey of chemists to investigate their perceptions of previously published research. Focusing on a specific issue of the Journal of the American Chemical Society published in 2003, respondents were asked to select which articles they thought best matched importance and significance given several contexts: highest number of citations, most significant (subjectively defined), most likely to share among chemists, and most likely to share with a broader audience. The answers to the survey can be summed up in several observations. The ability of respondents to predict the citation counts of established research is markedly lower than the ability of those counts to be predicted by the h-index of the corresponding author of each article. This observation is conserved even when only considering responses from chemists whose expertise falls within the subdiscipline that best describes the work performed in an article. Respondents view both cited papers and significant papers differently than papers that should be shared with chemists. We conclude from our results that peer judgements of importance and significance differ from metrics-based measurements, and that chemists should work with bibliometricians to develop metrics that better capture the nuance of opinions on the importance of a given piece of research."
"Accurate measurement of institutional research productivity should account for the real contribution of the research staff to the output produced in collaboration with other organizations. In the framework of bibliometric measurement, this implies accounting for both the number of co-authors and each individual's real contribution to scientific publications. Common practice in the life sciences is to indicate such contribution through the order of author names in the byline. In this work, we measure the distortion introduced to university-level bibliometric productivity rankings when the number of co-authors or their position in the byline is ignored. The field of observation consists of all Italian universities active in the life sciences (Biology and Medicine). The analysis is based on the research output of the university staff over the period 2004-2008. Based on the results, we recommend against the use of bibliometric indicators that ignore co-authorship and real contribution of each author to research outputs."
OBJECTIVE. The purpose of this article is to propose a rule for determining which recommendation American Journal of Roentgenology (AJR) reviewers should provide when performing a review of a manuscript. CONCLUSION. The rule described here should allow reviewers to better understand the features that journal editors seek in a manuscript and to determine which recommendation to provide for any specific manuscript.
"In the pharmaceutical industry, bioanalysis is very dynamic and is probably one of the few fields of research covering the entire drug discovery, development and post-marketing process. Important decisions on drug safety can partially rely on bioanalytical data, which therefore can be subject to regulatory scrutiny. Bioanalytical scientists have historically contributed significant numbers of scientific manuscripts in many peer-reviewed analytical journals. All of these journals provide some high-level instructions, but they also leave sufficient flexibility for reviewers to perform independent critique and offer recommendations for each submitted manuscript. Reviewers play a pivotal role in the process of bioanalytical publication to ensure the publication of high-quality manuscripts in a timely fashion. Their efforts usually lead to improved manuscripts. However, it has to be a joint effort among authors, reviewers and editors to promote scientifically sound and ethically fair bioanalytical publications. Most of the submitted manuscripts were well written with only minor or moderate revisions required for further improvement. Nevertheless, there were small numbers of submitted manuscripts that did not meet the requirements for publications because of scientific or ethical deficiencies, which are discussed in this Letter to the Editor.

"Argument The scientific system is primarily differentiated into disciplines. While disciplines may be wide in scope and diverse in their research practices, they serve scientific communities that evaluate research and also grant recognition to what is published. The analysis of communication and publication practices within such a community hence allows us to shed light on the dynamics of this discipline. On the basis of an empirical analysis of Isis, we show how the process of discipline-building in history of science has led its practitioners to be socialized and sensitized in relatively strong intra-disciplinary terms - with minimal interdisciplinary openness."
"The Journal Impact Factors (JIF) has become nowadays one of the most frequently used scientometric indictor, the Hirsch's index (h-index) has also got positive reception in the scientometric literature. In this study, the journals of reproduction biology were compared with JIF and h-indices computed from the ISI Web of Science. This h-index (2001-2008) exhibited a high correlation with the 5 years JIF (2004-2008) (r = 0,64, p = 0.001), the relative h-index showed a weak correlation with the JIF (r = 0.42, p = 0.049). A ranking of 25 reproduction journals is presented on the basis of this JIF or h-index."
"This study aimed to identify and analyze characteristics of classic articles published in the Web of Science social work subject category from 1856 to 2011. Articles that have been cited at least 50 times were assessed regarding publication outputs, distribution of outputs in journals, publications of authors, institutions, countries as well as citation life cycles of articles with the highest total citations since its publication up to 2011 and the highest citations in 2011. Five bibliometric indicators were used to evaluate source countries, institutions, and authors. Results showed that 721 of the most highly referenced articles, published between 1957 and 2008, had been cited at least 50 times. Child Abuse & Neglect and American Journal of Community Psychology published the most classic articles. USA produced 89 % of classic articles and also published the most number of single, internationally collaborative, first author, and corresponding author classic articles. The top 38 productive institutions were all located in the US. The University of Illinois was the most productive institution for the total classic articles while University of California, Los Angeles produced the most inter-institutionally collaborative articles and Arizona State University published the most single institution articles. Furthermore, a new indicator, Y-index was successfully applied to evaluate publication characteristics of authors and institutions. High percentage of authors had the same numbers of first author and corresponding author status of classic articles in social work field."
"Based on a survey, the following study investigates opinions and also usage patterns relating to the ResearchGate social networking site for scientists and researchers. The survey consisted of 19 questions and was conducted online with 695 scientists from the disciplines of physics, biology, medicine, and neuroscience. Amongst other issues, the research questions concerned how much time and effort the interviewees expended on ResearchGate, what added value they perceived in using the site, the extent to which social aspects influence use, how participants planned to use the platform in future, and what role Research-Gate's own metric, the RG score, played for the scientists. In addition, we discuss which of the factors of age, sex, origin, and scientific discipline have a decisive influence on the responses of the interviewees and which are of no statistical significance The results clearly show that the origin of the participants is frequently decisive, but that the remaining factors also have a considerable influence on the responses for more than 25% of the questions."
"The rise of scientific specializations and disciplines depends on the formation of specialized scientific communities. The establishment of specialized scholarly journals facilitates the formation of such communities or networks. Publications, especially articles in specialized journals, have become institutionalized as the 'ultimate' form of scientific communication. Specialized journals fulfil a key role in the scientific disciplines. They both secure the shared values of a scientific community and endorse what that community takes to be certified knowledge. This article first elaborates on the evolution of communication within scientific disciplines. Afterwards, it presents an analysis of publication practices in the main generalist sociology journals in the Low Countries. Because of the close relationship between journals and discipline, this sociological analysis addresses the evolution of sociology itself."
"The Elsevier journal Virology has started a trial program of author-initiated repurposing of reviews from papers previously rejected from high-impact journals. The program, called Streamline Reviews, is described and compared to other recent initiatives in portable reviews."
"Nine Brazilian scientists with an outstanding profile of international publications were invited to publish an original article in the same issue of a Brazilian Journal (Anais da Academia Brasileira de Ciencias). The objective was to measure the impact of the papers on the number of citations to the articles, the assumption being that these authors would carry their international prestige to the Brazilian periodical. In a 2-year period there was a larger number of citations of these articles compared to others published in the same journal. Nevertheless, the number of citations in Brazilian journals did not equal the number of citations obtained by the other papers by the same authors in their international publications within the same 2-year period. The reasons for this difference in the number of citations could be either that less significant invited articles were submitted or that it was due to the intrinsic lack of visibility of the Brazilian journals, but this could not be fully determined with the present data. Also relevant was a comparison between the citations of Brazilian journals and the publication in Brazilian journals by these selected authors. A clear imbalance due to a remarkable under-citation of Brazilian authors by authors publishing in Brazilian journals raises the possibility that psychological factors may affect the decision of citing Brazilian journals."
"In this short communication we give critical comments on the paper of Perakakis et al. (Scientometrics 85(2):553-559, 2010) on ""Natural selection of academic papers"". The criticism mainly focusses on their unbalanced criticism of peer review and their negative evaluation of the link of peer review with commercial publishing."
"The present study identifies the main Spanish core research areas in the area of addictions through the bibliographic coupling analysis of the publications at the Web of Science under the substance abuse heading. The bibliographic coupling methodology is the analytical procedure that determines the thematic-intellectual proximity of the documents under consideration through the identification of the shared or simultaneously cited bibliography by those documents. A factor analysis and network analysis have been carried out to cluster documents, graphically represent the existing core research areas, and analyse the interrelations between them. We have identified 30 core research areas. Alcohol is the topic of attention of 17 areas and cocaine has a strong presence in 6. Heroin and opiates are only present as prominent substances in 4 areas and cannabis and tobacco in other two for each substance. It has been found that there is a significant degree of fragmentation in the area, with the existence of numerous research foci but with few connections with each other and few documents showing shared common knowledge. Also noteworthy is the large number of emerging research areas, reflecting an incipient stage in many of the research topics. Consideration must be placed in promoting scientific consensus and cohesion of the discipline as well as to encouraging the consolidation of main lines that respond to the social problems and research challenges."
"The purpose of this study was to identify the top-cited articles published in environmental science journals listed in Journal Citation Reports (JCR). The Web of Science database was used to retrieve the top-cited articles having 500 or more total citations from their publication to 2010. The articles were analyzed with regard to institution and country of origin with five indicators including total number of top-cited articles, as well as independent, collaborative, first author, and corresponding author articles. Article life was also investigated for history of impact of articles. Results showed that 88 articles were cited more than 500 times. These articles appeared in 26 different journals, with 28% of all top-cited articles in Environmental Science & Technology, followed by Water Resources Research. The top-cited articles published since 1971 to 2002 were from 17 countries. The USA published the most of the articles and was ranked on top among the five indicators. The U.S. Geological Survey was the most productive institution while, the Brunel University, UK published the most inter-institutionally collaborative and corresponding author articles under environmental science category.

"This article seeks to address and dispel some of the popular myths and misconceptions surrounding authorship of a scientific publication as this is often misconstrued by beginners in academia especially those in the developing world. While ethical issues in publishing related to authorship have been increasingly discussed, not much has been written about the myths and misconceptions of who might be an author. Dispelling these myths and misconceptions would go a long way in shaping the thoughts and plans of students, junior faculty and researchers in academia especially in the developing world."
"This article investigates the recent trends in co-authorship in economics. Using data from more than 700000 journal articles we show that the average number of authors per article has increased over the last years. This process is likely to be continued in the future. In a regression analysis, we present evidence how the authorship of papers is related to the number of citations, the JEL classification, the number of journal pages and the length of the title."
"This article provides an introduction to the use of altmetrics as a tool to assess research impact. In particular, it looks at the evidence behind claims that altmetrics allow the impact of research to be measured in days rather than years. Low correlations between altmetrics and article citations make it doubtful that altmetrics can reliably predict future citations. In addition, there are good reasons to qualify statements that altmetrics measure the wider impact of research on society. Librarians should be careful not to overstate the value of altmetrics when recommending their use as a complement to more traditional measures of research quality."
"Purpose: Preresidency peer-reviewed publications (PRP) have been associated with resident choice of academic versus private practice careers in both neurosurgery and radiation oncology. The relationship between PRP and subsequent citation-based scholarly activity of radiation oncology residents has not been previously examined. Methods and Materials: A list of 2016 radiation oncology resident graduates (163 residents from 76 Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education-certified programs) and their PRP were compiled. The Scopus bibliometric citation database was then searched to collect Hirsch index (h-index) data for each resident, as well as manuscripts limited to first-author only and first- or second-author only for each resident. Analyses were stratified based on the absence or presence of (at least 1) PRP for each resident. Results: The mean h-index score for all resident graduates was 4.15. Residents with at least 1 PRP had significantly higher h-index scores (5.93 vs 2.12; P < .01) than those with no PRP. PRP was also associated with significantly higher first-author only (2.84 vs 1.17; P < .01) and second-author only (3.90 vs 1.47; P < .01) scores. Conclusions: Radiation oncology residents with at least 1 PRP are significantly more likely than those with no PRP to have higher h-index scores, as well as higher scores when stratified by first and/or second authorship. The average radiation oncology resident graduate with at least 1 PRP has published approximately 6 manuscripts cited at least 6 times, been first or second author on nearly 4 manuscripts cited at least 4 times, and been first author on nearly 3 manuscripts cited at least 3 times. More than 30% of graduates without PRP did not publish any cited manuscripts. These results allow for potential predictive evaluation of resident productivity during the radiation oncology residency applicant process and have potential utility in predicting career choices postresidency.

"Citation numbers and other quantities derived from bibliographic databases are becoming standard tools for the assessment of productivity and impact of research activities. Though widely used, still their statistical properties have not been well established so far. This is especially true in the case of bibliometric indicators aimed at the evaluation of individual scholars, because large-scale data sets are typically difficult to be retrieved. Here, we take advantage of a recently introduced large bibliographic data set, Google Scholar Citations, which collects the entire publication record of individual scholars. We analyze the scientific profile of more than 30,000 researchers, and study the relation between the h-index, the number of publications and the number of citations of individual scientists. While the number of publications of a scientist has a rather weak relation with his/her h-index, we find that the h-index of a scientist is strongly correlated with the number of citations that she/he has received so that the number of citations can be effectively be used as a proxy of the h-index. Allowing for the h-index to depend on both the number of citations and the number of publications, we find only a minor improvement."
"Context: Although qualitative studies are becoming more appreciated in healthcare, the number of publications of quality studies remains low. Little is known about the frequency and characteristics of citation in qualitative studies. Objective: To compare the academic impact of qualitative studies to that of two quantitative studies: systematic reviews and randomized controlled trials. Methods: Publications in BMJ between 1997 and 2006 (BMJ's median impact factor was 7.04 during this period) employing qualitative methods were matched to two quantitative studies appearing the same year using PubMed. Using Web of Science, citations within a 24-month publication period were determined. Additionally, three hypotheses were examined: qualitative studies are 1) infrequently cited in original articles or reviews; 2) rarely cited by authors in non-English-speaking countries; and 3) more frequently cited in non-medical disciplines (e. g., psychology or sociology). Results: A total of 121 qualitative studies, 270 systematic reviews, and 515 randomised controlled trials were retrieved. Qualitative studies were cited a total of 1,089 times, with a median of 7.00 times (range, 0-34) for each study. Matched systematic reviews and randomized controlled trials were cited 2,411times and 1,600 times, respectively. With respect to citing documents, original articles and reviews exceeded 60% for each study design. Relative to quantitative studies, qualitative studies were cited more often by authors in English-speaking countries. With respect to subject area, medical disciplines were more frequently cited than non-medical disciplines for all three study designs (>80%). Conclusion: The median number of citations for qualitative studies was almost the same as the median of BMJ's impact factor during the survey period. For a suitable evaluation of qualitative studies in healthcare, it will be necessary to develop a reporting framework and include explicit discussions of clinical implications when reporting findings. Coordination between researchers and editors will be needed to achieve this goal."
"Background: In this paper, we identify and analyze the top 100 cited articles in urology since 1965 and assess changes in the top 100 since 2007. Methods: We selected highest impact journals in both urological and general medicine journals from the 2011 edition of Journal Citation Reports: Science edition. We identified and analyzed the 100 most cited articles using the Science Citation Index Expanded (1965-present). Results: The top 100 articles were cited a mean of 892 times (range: 529-2088) and published between 1966 and 2009, with 21 published since 2000. In 2012, 19 new articles appeared in the updated top 100 cited articles. Also, 16 journals were represented, led by the New England Journal of Medicine (n=36), the Journal of Urology (n=16) and the Lancet (n=12). In total, 81 articles were published from North America (USA=77, Canada=4). From the United States, the following institutes were among the top 5 represented: Johns Hopkins University (n=12), Harvard University, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Centre, National Institute of Health and Washington University (all 5). Only one institute outside the United States published more than one article in the top 100 (Institut Gustave Roussy, France). Nine urologists were first authors of 2 or more articles. Oncology (n=54) and transplantation (n=22) were the most common subspecialties represented. Conclusion: It is important to acknowledge the top cited articles as they mark key topics and advances in urology. There has been a 19% change in the top 100 cited articles in the past 5 years. Oncology and transplantation remain the most highly cited topics."
"Commemorating the 100th death anniversary of Francis Galton, this paper is a bibliometric impact analysis of the works of this outstanding scientist and predecessor of scientometrics. Citation analysis was done in Web of Science, Scopus and Google Scholar (Publish or Perish) in order to retrieve the most cited books and journal articles. Additionally references were identified where Galton was rather mentioned than cited in order to analyze the phenomenon of obliteration by incorporation. Finally occurrence counts of Galton's works in obituaries, Festschrift, the website Galton.org, major encyclopaedias and biographical indexes were compared to citation counts. As an outcome Galton's works are increasingly cited or mentioned. Obliteration (use of eponyms) applies to one-third of Galton's works and seems to be typical for fields like mathematics or statistics, whereas citations are more common in psychology. The most cited books and journal articles are also the most mentioned with remarkable correlation. Overall citation analysis and occurrence counting are complementary useful methods for the impact analysis of the works of ""giants""."
"The research performance of a small group of 49 young scholars, such as doctoral students, postdoctoral and junior researchers, working in different technical and scientific fields, was evaluated based on 11 types of research outputs. The scholars worked at a technical university in the fields of Civil Engineering, Ecology, Economics, Informatics, Materials Engineering, Mechanical Engineering, and Safety Engineering. Principal Component Analysis was used to statistically analyze the research outputs and its results were compared with factor and cluster analysis. The metrics of research productivity describing the types of research outputs included the number of papers, books and chapters published in books, the number of patents, utility models and function samples, and the number of research projects conducted. The metrics of citation impact included the number of citations and h-index. From these metrics -the variables -the principal component analysis extracted 4 main principal components. The 1st principal component characterized the cited publications in high-impact journals indexed by the Web of Science. The 2nd principal component represented the outputs of applied research and the 3rd and 4th principal components represented other kinds of publications. The results of the principal component analysis were compared with the hierarchical clustering using Ward's method. The scatter plots of the principal component analysis and the Mahalanobis distances were calculated from the 4 main principal component scores, which allowed us to statistically evaluate the research performance of individual scholars. Using variance analysis, no influence of the field of research on the overall research performance was found. Unlike the statistical analysis of individual research metrics, the approach based on the principal component analysis can provide a complex view of the research systems."
"This paper examines aspects of journal articles published from 1967 to 2008, located in eight databases, and authored or co-authored by academics serving for at least two years in Australian US programs from 1959 to 2008. These aspects are: inclusion of publications in databases, publications in journals, authorship characteristics of publications, productivity, and subject content of publications over time. Results indicate that national and LIS-specific databases provided adequate coverage; however, no single database provided over half of all publications. More than half of all articles were published in national journals focusing on aspects of US in Australia; however, there is a trend for increasing publications in international journals. Most of the earlier publications had one author, but multiple authorship in publications has increased since 1999. Overall the number of publications per LIS academic is low; however, per capita productivity has been increasing since the mid-1990s. Finally, titles of articles reveal a shift from library-related terms to information-related terms."
"We investigate the coverage of Microsoft Academic (MA) just over a year after its re-launch. First, we provide a detailed comparison for the first author's record across the four major data sources: Google Scholar (GS), MA, Scopus and Web of Science (WoS) and show that for the most important academic publications, journal articles and books, GS and MA display very similar publication and citation coverage, leaving both Scopus and WoS far behind, especially in terms of citation counts. A second, large scale, comparison for 145 academics across the five main disciplinary areas confirms that citation coverage for GS and MA is quite similar for four of the five disciplines. MA citation coverage in the Humanities is still substantially lower than GS coverage, reflecting MA's lower coverage of non-journal publications. However, we shouldn't forget that MA coverage for the Humanities still dwarfs coverage for this discipline in Scopus and WoS. It would be desirable for other researchers to verify our findings with different samples before drawing a definitive conclusion about MA coverage. However, based on our current findings we suggest that, only one year after its re-launch, MA is rapidly become the data source of choice; it appears to be combining the comprehensive coverage across disciplines, displayed by GS, with the more structured approach to data presentation, typical of Scopus and WoS. The Phoenix seems to be ready to leave the nest, all set to start its life into an adulthood of research evaluation."
"To identify delayed recognition publications, or 'Sleeping Beauties' (SBs), that are scarcely cited in the years or decades following their publication, but then go on to become highly cited, we screened citation histories of 184,606 articles in 52 ophthalmology journals using the Science Citation Index-Expanded (Thomson Reuters). Nine articles were identified as SBs, which accounted for 0.005% of basic materials. The SBs were published in Archives of Ophthalmology (n = 3), American Journal of Ophthalmology (n = 3), Acta Ophthalmologica (n = 1), Investigative Ophthalmology and Visual Science (n = 1), and Japanese Journal of Clinical Ophthalmology (n = 1). For citation histories according to the conjuring SB from the fairy tale, the sleep duration ranged from 7 to 59 years with mean of 19.7 years, the depth of sleep as evaluated by the average citations per year during the sleeping period ranged from 0.09 to 0.82 with mean of 0.45 citations, and the awake intensity as determined by the average citations per year during the first 5 years period following awakening ranged from 3.60 to 17.80 with mean of 8.51 citations. The number of total citations up to 2010 ranged from 109 to 375 with mean of 176.3 citations. Topics of the SBs covered description of new clinical diseases including acute retinal necrosis syndrome, cancer-associated retinopathy, and polypoidal choroidal vasculopathy, correlate of central corneal thickness with intraocular pressure readings, inadvertent eyeball perforation in retrobulbar anesthesia, pharmacologic weakening of extraocular muscles, amniotic membrane graft for ocular surface reconstruction, and refractive surgery. These data provide a perspective of rare but interesting delayed citation articles in ophthalmology."
"Bibliometric analysis has been used increasingly as a tool within the scientific community. Interplay is vital between those involved in refining bibliometric methods and the recipients of this type of analysis. Production as well as citations patterns reflect working methodologies in different disciplines within the specialized Library and Information Science (LIS) field, as well as in the non-specialist (non-LIS) professional field. We extract the literature on bibliometric analyses from Web of Science in all fields of science and analyze clustering of co-occurring keywords at an aggregate level. It reveals areas of interconnected literature with different impact on the LIS and the non-LIS community.We classify and categorize bibliometric articles that obtain the most citations in accordance with a modified version of Derrick's, Jonker's and Lewison's method (Derrick et al. in Proceedings, 17th international conference on science and technology indicators. STI, Montreal, 2012). The data demonstrates that cross-referencing between the LIS and the non-LIS field is modest in publications outside their main categories of interest, i.e. discussions of various bibliometric issues or strict analyses of various topics. We identify some fields as less well-covered bibliometrically."
"As research becomes an ever more globalized activity, there is growing interest in national and international comparisons of standards and quality in different countries and regions. A sign for this trend is the increasing interest in rankings of universities according to their research performance, both inside but also outside the scientific environment. New methods presented in this paper, enable us to map centers of excellence around the world using programs that are freely available. Based on Scopus data, field-specific excellence can be identified and agglomerated in regions and cities where recently highly cited papers were published. Differences in performance rates can be visualized on the map using colours and sizes of the marks. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."
"Different diachronous citing units were used to determine if there are differences between rankings of journals measured by synchronous impact factors of first- and late-comer journals. A 5 year impact factor was chosen, with citation lags identified as a complementary method for first comers and alternative measurement for late comers. Selected diachronous indices were considered as alternatives for evaluating the short and long term performance of late comers without citation lags. The results show that the most significant index that promotes scientific fairness and recognition is the citation concentration index. As older journals gathered higher citations, this index enables late-comers to catch up with the citations. Hence, the diachronous impact factor is useful in providing a fairer assessment of the impact of the late-comer journals and could be used as a baseline for ranking ISI journals."
"Validity and reliability are long established as central tenets of ensuring good quality research. However, safeguarding validity and reliability can be challenging within the context of multi-platform social media research, as considerations such as access to data or self-selection place caveats upon the generalizability of any study and are exacerbated when multiple platforms are involved. In this article, examples are drawn from a recent empirical study and others to illustrate how these issues can become amplified within the context of multi-platform social media studies. These include reconsidering the concept of a representative sample across multiple platforms; issues balancing ethical considerations and terms of service in accessing data; and the effect of data repackaging strategies and extent to which similar data from different platforms can be comparable. The article will conclude by arguing that drawing upon qualitative approaches, particularly a complimentary reframing of the unit of analysis with a focus on particular users as case studies, can ameliorate these issues and strengthen the insight of multi-platform social media studies."
"The correct attribution of scientific publications to their true owners is extremely important, considering the detailed evaluation processes and the future investments based upon them. This attribution is a hard job for bibliometricians because of the increasing amount of documents and the raise of collaboration. Nevertheless, there is no published work with a comprehensive solution of the problem. This article introduces a procedure for the detailed identification and normalisation of addresses to facilitate the correct allocation of the scientific production included in databases. Thanks to our long experience in the manual normalisation of addresses, we have created and maintained various master lists. We have already developed an application to detect institutional sectors (issued in a previous paper) and now we analyse the details of particular institutions, taking advantage of our master tables. To test our methodology we have implemented it in a Spanish data set already manually codified (95,314 unique addresses included in the year 2008 on the Web of Science databases). This data was analysed with a full text search against our master lists, giving optional codes for each address and choosing which one could be automatically encoded and which one should be reviewed manually. The results of the implementation, comparing the automatic versus manual codes, showed 87 % automatically codified records with 1.9 % of error. We should review manually only 13 %. Finally, we applied the Wilcoxon non-parametric test to show the validity of the methodology, comparing detailed codes of centres already encoded with the automatically encoded ones, and concluding that their distribution was similar with a significance of 0.078."
"The science of science (SOS) is a rapidly developing field which aims to understand, quantify and predict scientific research and the resulting outcomes. The problem is essentially related to almost all scientific disciplines and thus has attracted attention of scholars from different backgrounds. Progress on SOS will lead to better solutions for many challenging issues, ranging from the selection of candidate faculty members by a university to the development of research fields to which a country should give priority. While different measurements have been designed to evaluate the scientific impact of scholars, journals and academic institutions, the multiplex structure, dynamics and evolution mechanisms of the whole system have been much less studied until recently. In this article, we review the recent advances in SOS, aiming to cover the topics from empirical study, network analysis, mechanistic models, ranking, prediction, and many important related issues. The results summarized in this review significantly deepen our understanding of the underlying mechanisms and statistical rules governing the science system. Finally, we review the forefront of SOS research and point out the specific difficulties as they arise from different contexts, so as to stimulate further efforts in this emerging interdisciplinary field.

"Citations to research reports are used as a measure for the influence of a scholar's research line when seeking promotion, grants, and awards. The current study documented the distributions of citations to kinesiology scholars of various academic ranks. Google Scholar Citations was searched for user profiles using five research interest areas related to kinesiology. Total Google Scholar Citations, rank, and country were collected for 741 scholars from 68 countries. Citation data for all ranks had large positive skews and wide variation, so percentile data were reported for scholars from four English-speaking countries with large numbers of Google Scholar Citations profiles (n = 233). There was a significant difference in the distribution of citations across the top three academic ranks. The current data provide confirmatory information on kinesiology scholar research influence from English-speaking countries, which can be used to supplement peer-evaluation of the research reports themselves."
"Academic and cultural heritage institutions around the world have made measurable strides in the development of digital sound archives oriented towards research and access, but their impact on scholarship and society has been little studied. Traditionally, impact has been measured by citations; yet these are problematic metrics for nontraditional outputs like sound recordings. Social media data provide a promising avenue of investigation for measuring scholarly as well as societal impact. Twitter in particular has been shown to provide a high number of references for cultural and research outputs in all disciplines. This study analyzes Twitter references pertaining to the collections of five digital sound archives: British Library Sounds, Europeana Sounds, the Internet Archive Audio Archive, PennSound, and UbuWeb. By using text analysis methods to identify high-frequency events and trends, and labeling them with a rubric designed for measuring the impact of digital heritage resources, this study provides preliminary insights on user values as they relate to digital sound collections. Despite the limitations of using social media data, the evidence gathered in this case study characterizes aspects of the use of digital sound collections, and may point to future priorities for the digital preservation of sound."
"The funding environment has a profound impact on researchers' behavior. In particular, it influences their freedom and readiness to conduct research ventures with highly uncertain outcomes. In this conceptual paper, we propose a concise new methodology to evaluate researchers' risk aversion based on citation statistics. The derived single-number criterion P-R is sensitive to the ratio of high impact versus average impact work, based on citation counts. We demonstrate the usefulness of P-R on a micro and meso level in the field of chemistry. P-R is a potentially valuable tool for managers in higher education, to control for the impact of their funding instruments. The conducted testing may, in addition, contribute to the literature stream dealing with the effects of peer review in the allocation of research funding. Our results support the view that peer review fosters mainstream research. However, faculties with the highest percentages of third-party funding may find ways to avoid the restrictive effects. We also find evidence that permanent positions back risky research endeavors."
In the present paper four myths of gender differences in scientific performance are presented and discussed. The persistence of these myths in different forms of evaluation is influencing the women's discriminations in research careers in combination with effects explained in other explanation models for the existence of the unseen barrier (glass ceiling) that keeps women from rising to the upper levels of the corporate ladder.
"This article overviews unethical publishing practices in connection with the pressure to publish more. Both open-access and subscription publishing models can be abused by 'predatory' authors, editors, and publishing outlets. Relevant examples of 'prolific' scholars are viewed through the prism of the violation of ethical authorship in established journals and indiscriminately boosting publication records elsewhere. The instances of ethical transgressions by brokering editorial agencies and agents, operating predominantly in non-Anglophone countries, are presented to raise awareness of predatory activities. The scheme of predatory publishing activities is presented, and several measures are proposed to tackle the issue of predatory publishing. The awareness campaigns by professional societies, consultations with information facilitators, implementation of the criteria of best target journals, and crediting of scholars with use of integrative citation metrics, such as the h-index, are believed to make a difference."
"This short note contains some remarks on a recent bibliometric survey about some of the major scientific journals in the field of Quality Engineering/Management (Qual. Reliab. Engng. Int. 2010; 26(6): 593-604). In particular, thanks to Professor Woodall's precious indication, it has been freshly noticed that some results in the original work are biased by mistakes in the bibliometric databases (in this case Google Scholar). After a careful examination and correction of biased data, a synthetic analysis of the typical mistakes of bibliometric databases is presented, focussing the attention on the importance of using robust bibliometric indicators.

"Background: Health research driven by the healthcare demands of the population can provide an informative evidence base to support decision-making processes on health policies, programmes, and practices. This paper surveyed the production of scientific research concerning health in Angola, specifically to access the publication rate over time, the main research topics and scientific fields, and the contribution of Angolan researchers and institutions. Methods: The study focused on data collected in a retrospective literature search in Biblioteca Virtual em Saude (BVS) as of June 8, 2014, with the keyword ""Angola"" and on content information in correspondent publications deposited in PubMed. Results: BVS generated 1,029 hits, 74.6 % of which were deposited in PubMed where 301 abstracts were described. From 1979 to 2003, there were 62 publications and in 2004-2013 the quantity increased four-fold (n = 232); malaria was the most frequent topic (n = 42). Angola was the country with the largest number of publications, taking into account the primary affiliation of the first author (n = 45). Universities, institutes, or research centres accounted for 65 % of the publications and in descending order Portugal, Brazil, and the United States of America occupied the three first positions. Epidemiology was by far the most frequent field of research (n = 165). Conclusions: The number of publications has increased steadily over the past 10 years, with predominance on malaria topics. Angola was the country with the largest number of major affiliations of the first author, but the contribution of Angolan institutions was relatively low, indicating a need to reinforce academic research institutions in the country."
"We analyze the author affiliations of database publications to determine the main institutions contributing research results in our field. We consider the publications of the last decade (2000-2009) that appeared in the top conferences SIGMOD and VLDB and in the VLDBJ and TODS journals. We determine the top affiliations in terms of number of papers and aggregate the numbers at the levels of entire countries and continents. Further, we analyze to which degree authors from different affiliations and countries cooperate on jointly authored papers, and study the development over time. We also consider the number and size of affiliations of different countries."
"Academic journals may especially influence the development of an emerging field; early editors of public policy journals were explicit about that goal. Two leading journalsthe Journal of Policy Analysis and Management and the Policy Studies Journalwere compared for changes between the early 1980s and 2007-2010. Over time, both journals published far fewer research articles by practitioners, and the non-university share of both editorial boards also declined. The journals continued to focus largely on the United States. Both showed a dramatic increase in the proportion of co-authored articles. Over time, JPAM became far more likely to publish studies by economists and far less likely to publish political scientists while PSJ increasingly published political scientists. JPAM authors now primarily reference economics journals. PSJ authors often cite political science, public administration, and other public policy journals. Both journals moved away from broad policy essays, with JPAM heavily trending to multivariate (essentially econometric) secondary analyses of large data sets and PSJ including a broader range of methodologies. Contrary to early predictions of a progressively more interdisciplinary field, the opposite trendstronger alignments with specific disciplinesreflects public policy's ongoing challenge in transcending long-standing academic legacies and boundaries."
"This paper discusses a concept for inferring attributes of 'frontier research' in peer-reviewed research proposals under the popular scheme of the European Research Council (ERC). The concept serves two purposes: firstly to conceptualize, define and operationalize in scientometric terms attributes of frontier research; and secondly to build and compare outcomes of a statistical model with the review decision in order to obtain further insight and reflect upon the influence of frontier research in the peer-review process. To this end, indicators across scientific disciplines and in accord with the strategic definition of frontier research by the ERC are elaborated, exploiting textual proposal information and other scientometric data of grant applicants. Subsequently, a suitable model is formulated to measure ex-post the influence of attributes of frontier research on the decision probability of a proposal to be accepted. We present first empirical data as proof of concept for inferring frontier research in grant proposals. Ultimately the concept is aiming at advancing the methodology to deliver signals for monitoring the effectiveness of peer-review processes."
"Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to study the effects of the choice of database and data retrieval methods on the research performance of a number of selected Asian universities from 33 countries using two different indicators (publication volume and citation count) and three subject fields (energy, environment and materials) during the period 2005-2009. Design/methodology/approach - To determine the effect of the choice of database, Scopus and Web of Science databases were queried to retrieve the publications and citations of the top ten Asian universities in three subject fields. In ascertaining the effect of data retrieval methods, the authors proposed a new data retrieval method called Keyword-based Data Retrieval (KDR), which uses relevant keywords identified by independent experts to retrieve publications and their citations of the top 30 Asian universities in the Environment field from the entire Scopus database. The results were then compared with those retrieved using the Conventional Data Retrieval (CDR) method. Findings - The Asian university ranking order is strongly affected by the choice of database, indicator, and the data retrieval method used. The KDR method yields many more publications and citation counts than the CDR method, shows better understanding of the university ranking results, and retrieves publications and citations in source titles outside those classified by the database. Moreover the publications found by the KDR method have a multidisciplinary research focus. Originality/value - The paper concludes that KDR is a more suitable methodology to retrieve data for measuring university research performance, particularly in an environment where universities are increasingly engaging in multidisciplinary research."
"Researchers have investigated factors thought to affect the total number of citations in various academic disciplines, and some general trends have emerged. However, there are still limited data for many fields, including aquatic sciences. Using papers published in 2003-2005 (n = 785), we investigated marine and freshwater biology articles to identify factors that may contribute to the probability of citation and for cumulative citation counts over 10 years. We found no relationships with probability of citation; however, we found evidence that for those that were cited at least once, cumulative citations were related to several factors. Articles cited by books received more citations than those never cited by books, which we hypothesized to be indicative of the impact an article may have in the field. We also found that articles first cited within 2 years of publication received more cumulative citations than those first cited after 2 years. We found no evidence that self-citation (as the first citation) had a significant effect on total citations. Our findings were compared with previous studies in other disciplines, and it was found that aquatic science citation patterns are comparable to fields in science and technology but less so to humanities and social sciences."
"OBJECTIVE There has been an increasing interest in the quantitative analysis of publishing within the field of neurosurgery at the individual, group, and institutional levels. The authors present an updated analysis of accredited pediatric neurosurgery training programs. METHODS All 28 Accreditation Council for Pediatric Neurosurgery Fellowship programs were contacted for the names of pediatric neurosurgeons who were present each year from 2011 through 2015. Faculty names were queried in Scopus for publications and citations during this time period. The 5-year institutional Hirsch index [ih(5)-index] and revised 5-year institutional h-index [ir(5)-index] were calculated to rank programs. Each publication was reviewed to determine authorship value, tier of research, clinical versus basic science research, subject matter, and whether it was pediatrics-specific. A unique 3-tier article classification system was introduced to stratify clinical articles by quality and complexity, with tier 3 being the lowest tier of publication (e.g., case reports) and tier 1 being the highest (e.g., randomized controlled trials). RESULTS Among 2060 unique publications, 1378 (67%) were pediatrics-specific. The pediatrics-specific articles had a mean of 15.2 citations per publication (median 6), whereas the non-pediatrics-specific articles had a mean of 23.0 citations per publication (median 8; p<0.0001). For the 46% of papers that had a pediatric neurosurgeon as first or last author, the mean number of citations per publication was 12.1 (median 5.0) compared with 22.5 (median 8.0) for those in which a pediatric neurosurgeon was a middle author (p<0.0001). Seventy-nine percent of articles were clinical research and 21% were basic science or translational research; however, basic science and translational articles had a mean of 36.9 citations per publication (median 15) compared with 12.6 for clinical publications (median 5.0; p<0.0001). Among clinical articles, tier 1 papers had a mean of 15.0 citations per publication (median 8.0), tier 2 papers had a mean of 18.7 (median 8.0), and tier 3 papers had a mean of 7.8 (median 3.0). Neuro-oncology papers received the highest number of citations per publication (mean 25.7). The most common journal was the Journal of Neurosurgery: Pediatrics (20%). MD/PhD faculty members had significantly more citations per publication than MD faculty members (mean 26.7 vs 14.0; p<0.0001) and also a higher number of publications per author (mean 38.6 vs 20.8). The median ih(5)- and ir(5)-indices per program were 14 (range 5-48) and 10 (range 5.6-37.2), respectively. The mean ir(5)/ih(5)-index ratio was 0.8. The top 5 fellowship programs (in descending order) as ranked by the ih(5)-index corrected for number of faculty members were The Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto; Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh; University of California, San Francisco Benioff Children's Hospital; Seattle Children's Hospital; and St. Louis Children's Hospital. CONCLUSIONS About two-thirds of publications authored by pediatric neurosurgeons are pediatrics-specific, although non-pediatrics-specific articles averaged more citations. Most of the articles authored by pediatric neurosurgeons are clinical, with basic and translational articles averaging more citations. Neurosurgeons with PhD degrees averaged more total publications and more citations per publication. In all, this is the most advanced and informative analysis of publication productivity in pediatric neurosurgery to date."
"Peer review works as the hinge of the scientific process, mediating between research and the awareness/acceptance of its results. While it might seem obvious that science would regulate itself scientifically, the consensus on peer review is eroding; a deeper understanding of its workings and potential alternatives is sorely needed. Employing a theoretical approach supported by agent-based simulation, we examined computational models of peer review, performing what we propose to call redesign, that is, the replication of simulations using different mechanisms. Here, we show that we are able to obtain the high sensitivity to rational cheating that is present in literature. In addition, we also show how this result appears to be fragile against small variations in mechanisms. Therefore, we argue that exploration of the parameter space is not enough if we want to support theoretical statements with simulation, and that exploration at the level of mechanisms is needed. These findings also support prudence in the application of simulation results based on single mechanisms, and endorse the use of complex agent platforms that encourage experimentation of diverse mechanisms."
"We introduce the h-degree of a node as a basic indicator for weighted networks. The h-degree (d(h)) of a node is the number d(h) if this node has at least d(h) links with other nodes and the strength of each of these links is greater than or equal to d(h). Based on the notion of h-degree other notions are developed such as h-centrality and h-centralization, leading to a new set of indicators characterizing nodes in a network. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

"Objective measures of research productivity depend on how frequently a publication is cited. Metrics such as the Hirsch index (h-index; total number of publications h that have at least h citations) allow for an objective measurement of the scientific impact of an author's publications. The purpose of this study was to assess and compare the h-index among aesthetic plastic surgery fellowship directors to that of fellowship directors in craniofacial surgery and microsurgery. We conducted a cross-sectional study of all fellowship directors in aesthetic surgery, craniofacial surgery, and microsurgery in the United States and Canada. The gathered data were categorized as bibliometric (h-index, i10-index, total number of publications, total number of citations, maximum citations for a single work, and number of self-citations) and demographic (gender, training background). Descriptive statistics were computed. The sample was composed of 30 aesthetic surgeons (93% male), 33 craniofacial surgeons (97% male), and 32 microsurgeons (94% male). The mean h-index was 13.7 for aesthetics, 16.9 for craniofacial, and 12.4 for microsurgery. There were no significant differences for any of the bibliometric measures between the three subspecialties, despite the fact that academic rank and years in practice were significantly different. As measured by the h-index, there is a high level of academic productivity among fellowship directors, regardless of subspecialty area. Unlike other plastic surgery subspecialties however, the h-index of aesthetic plastic surgeons is not correlated to academic rank, revealing a discrepancy between perceptions of aesthetic plastic surgery and its actual academic impact."
"Bioinformatics is a fast-growing field based on the optimal use of ""big data"" gathered in genomic, proteomics, and functional genomics research. In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive and in-depth bibliometric analysis of the field of bioinformatics by extracting citation data from PubMed Central full-text. Citation data for the period 2000 to 2011, comprising 20,869 papers with 546,245 citations, was used to evaluate the productivity and influence of this emerging field. Four measures were used to identify productivity; most productive authors, most productive countries, most productive organizations, and most popular subject terms. Research impact was analyzed based on the measures of most cited papers, most cited authors, emerging stars, and leading organizations. Results show the overall trends between the periods 2000 to 2003 and 2004 to 2007 were dissimilar, while trends between the periods 2004 to 2007 and 2008 to 2011 were similar. In addition, the field of bioinformatics has undergone a significant shift, co-evolving with other biomedical disciplines."
"With Dimensions, Digital Science provides the research community a new approach on research related information, bringing formerly siloed content types such as grants, patents, clinical trials with publications and citations together, making it as openly available as possible (see app.dimensions.ai). Due to the different content types, (controversial) journal based classifications were not an option since it would not allow to categorise grants etc. Hence Digital Science opted for applying a categorisation approach using machine learning and based on the content of the documents and well established classification systems for which a training set was available. The implementation at launch was a first step and requires to be improved-although we observe a reliability comparably to manual coding for grants, the implementation at launch comes with some shortcomings as observed by Bornmann (2018), mostly due to challenges with the training set coverage. To overcome the shortcomings of the initial categorization approach we implemented an improvement process with the research community and Lutz Bornmann's analysis presented a great opportunity to provide more transparency and insights in the ongoing improvements."
"We propose a model-based strategy for ranking scientific journals starting from a set of observed bibliometric indicators that represent imperfect measures of the unobserved 'value' of a journal. After discretizing the available indicators, we estimate an extended latent class model for polytomous item response data and use the estimated model to cluster journals. We illustrate our approach by using the data from the Italian research evaluation exercise that was carried out for the period 2004-2010, focusing on the set of journals that are considered relevant for the subarea statistics and financial mathematics. Using four bibliometric indicators (IF, IF5, AIS and the h-index), some of which are not available for all journals, and the information contained in a set of covariates, we derive a complete ordering of these journals. We show that the methodology proposed is relatively simple to implement, even when the aim is to cluster journals into a small number of ordered groups of a fixed size. We also analyse the robustness of the obtained ranking with respect to different discretization rules."
"Albarran et al (2009a) introduced a novel methodology for the evaluation of citation distributions using a pair of high- and low-impact measures defined over the set of articles with citations below or above a critical citation level. Albarran et al (2009b) presented the first empirical applications to a situation in which the world citation distribution in 22 scientific fields is partitioned into three geographical areas: the USA, the European Union, and the rest of the world. In this paper, we find that cardinal differences between the results obtained with our high-impact index and the mean citation rate are of a large order of magnitude. When, in addition, the percentage in the top 5% of most cited articles or the percentage of uncited articles are used, there are still important quantitative differences with respect to the high- and low-impact indicators advocated in our approach."
"Our field has enjoyed amazing growth over the years. Is this a good thing or a bad thing, or just a thing? Good: Growth sounds good. It is hard to imagine a politician arguing against jobs. There are more people working in the field than ever before, and they are publishing more and more, and creating more and more value. What could be wrong with that? Bad: Whatever you measure you get. We are all under too much pressure to publish too much too quickly. Students are graduating these days with more publications than what used to be expected for tenure. So many people are publishing so much that no one has time to think great thoughts, or take time to learn about things that may not be directly relevant to the next publication. Neutral: Inflation is a fact of life. There are long-term macro trends on publication rates that are beyond our control. These trends hold over tens and hundreds of years, and will continue over the foreseeable future."
"A bibliometric method was developed to investigate the aerosol research based on the papers from 1991 to 2009 in Science Citation Index Expanded, the Thomson Reuters. The analysed aspects covered scientific output and citation tracking on the basis of journal patterns; country; institute and author research performances. Improved indicators Peak-Year Citation per Publication and Relative Peak-Year Rate were applied. A significant share of the citation impact and the most cited articles distribution were identified. Lotka's law held good in author performance. Finally, the paper discusses the imperfect nature of the indicators and proposes complementary methods for research evaluation procedures."
"Introduction: Identification of highly cited articles based on the h-index and its properties is important for the evaluation of the past, present, and future of any research discipline. In this study, we aimed to identify the h-classic articles in orthodontics. Methods: One search on the Web of Science identified all articles from 2000 to 2015 in the 89 journals indexed by the 2015 InCites Journal Citation Reports in the scientific area ""dentistry, oral surgery, and medicine."" A second search was performed in the Web of Science using all mesh terms related to orthodontics. Then, we applied the h-classic method to select the recent articles with the greatest scientific impact in orthodontics. Results: Eighty articles were considered as h-classic articles. They were published in 20 of the 89 dental journals of the 2015 InCites Journal Citation Reports list. Only 36 articles appeared in orthodontic journals: 23 in the American Journal of Orthodontics & Dentofacial Orthopedics (28.8%), 7 in The Angle Orthodontist (8.8%), and 6 in European Journal of Orthodontics (7.5%). Thirty-eight articles originated from Europe, 28 from the Americas, and 14 from the Middle East and Asia. Conclusions: More than half of fundamental orthodontic research is published in nonorthodontic journals showing that our field is currently limited, and interactions with other research fields should be sought to increase orthodontic research importance and appeal."
"Based on our involvement in numerous consortia and projects with colleagues from low-and middle-income countries (LMICs), as well as on our extensive fieldwork experience in the global South, we have a shared concern on the actual inclusion of LMIC colleagues and institutions in coproducing highly valuable and policy-relevant science. While capacity building is stated as a major goal in various international research projects, especially when involving partners from LMICs or when focusing on research activities in these countries, we think that research from established groups and universities particularly in member countries of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), receives more interest and respect on a disproportionate basis. With the present submission, we hope to feed the debate on the academic valorization of research performed by LMICs scholars. Though difficult to measure, this merits close scrutiny."
"The aim of this paper is to present new ideas in evaluating Shanghai University's Academic Ranking of World Universities (ARWU). In particular, this paper shall try to determine whether the normalization of data affects University ranks. In accordance with this, both the normalized and original (raw) data for each of the six variables has been obtained. Based on a sample containing the 54 US universities which are placed in the ARWU top 100, the statistical I-distance method was performed. The results showed great inconsistencies between university ranks obtained for the original and normalized data. These findings were then analyzed and the universities that had the greatest fluctuation in their ranks were noted."
"In the present study, the frequency of research misconduct in Korean medical papers was analyzed using the similarity check software iThenticate((R)). All Korean papers written in English that were published in 2009 and 2014 in KoreaMed Synapse were identified. In total, 23,848 papers were extracted. 4,050 original articles of them were randomly selected for similarity analysis. The average Similarity Index of the 4,050 papers decreased over time, particularly in 2013: in 2009 and 2014, it was 10.15% and 5.62%, respectively. And 357 (8.8%) had a Similarity Index of >= 20%. Authors considered a Similarity Index of = 20% as suspected research misconduct. It was found that iThenticate((R)) cannot functionally process citations without double quotation marks. Papers with a Similarity Index of = 20% were thus individually checked for detecting such text-matching errors to accurately identify papers with suspected research misconduct. After correcting textmatching errors, 142 (3.5% of the 4,050 papers) were suspected of research misconduct. The annual frequency of these papers decreased over time, particularly in 2013: in 2009 and 2014, it was 5.2% and 1.7%, respectively. The decrease was associated with the introduction of CrossCheck by KoreaMed and the frequent use of similarity check software. The majority (81%) had Similarity Indices between 20% and 40%. The fact suggested that low Similarity index does not necessarily mean low possibility of research misconduct. It should be noted that, although iThenticate((R)) provides a fundamental basis for detecting research misconduct, the final judgment should be made by experts."
"Individual research output (IRO) evaluation is both practically and theoretically. important. Current research tends to only consider either bibliometric measures or peer review in IRO evaluation. This paper argues that bibliometric measures and peer review should be applied simultaneously to evaluate IRO. Moreover, in real life situations IRO evaluations are often made by groups and inevitably contain evaluators' subjective judgments. Accordingly, this paper develops a fuzzy multi-criteria group evaluation method which considers objective and subjective evaluations, i.e., bibliometric measures and peer review opinions simultaneously. The goals here are to conquer weighting difficulty and achieve maximum group consensus. This requires determining criteria weights, which we do with an intuitionistic fuzzy weighted averaging operator and then determining evaluator weights, which we do with a fuzzy distance-based method. Thereafter, we use a revised TOPSIS method to aggregate the objective and subjective ratings. A practical case study is used to test the feasibility of the methodology. Finally, we discuss the effectiveness of the proposed method. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."
"Automated methods for the analysis, modeling, and visualization of large-scale scientometric data provide measures that enable the depiction of the state of world scientific development. We aimed to integrate minimum span clustering (MSC) and minimum spanning tree methods to cluster and visualize the global pattern of scientific publications (PSP) by analyzing aggregated Science Citation Index (SCI) data from 1994 to 2011. We hypothesized that PSP clustering is mainly affected by countries' geographic location, ethnicity, and level of economic development, as indicated in previous studies. Our results showed that the 100 countries with the highest rates of publications were decomposed into 12 PSP groups and that countries within a group tended to be geographically proximal, ethnically similar, or comparable in terms of economic status. Hubs and bridging nodes in each knowledge production group were identified. The performance of each group was evaluated across 16 knowledge domains based on their specialization, volume of publications, and relative impact. Awareness of the strengths and weaknesses of each group in various knowledge domains may have useful applications for examining scientific policies, adjusting the allocation of resources, and promoting international collaboration for future developments."
"The National Institutes of Health has implemented new grant application guidelines that include a substantial reduction in the number of pages allowed for project descriptions. Shorter proposals will potentially decrease reviewer burden, but investigators may find the new page limits challenging. Writing more concisely while still presenting a persuasive argument requires honing certain skills with regard to preparation, construction, and editing of proposals. This article provides strategies from the Western Journal of Nursing Research editorial board for preparing competitive shorter research proposals. Two key strategies for success are fully conceptualizing the study prior to writing and obtaining assistance from experienced colleagues during the editing process."
"According to the Academic Ranking of World Universities, the world's top 500 universities are located in only 38 countries, with the USA alone having 157 of them. This article investigates the socioeconomic determinants of the wide performance gap between countries, and whether the USA's dominance is largely due to its economic power. A large amount of cross-country variation in university performance can be explained by just four socioeconomic factors: income, population size, research and development spending, and the national language. Conditional on the resources that it has, the USA is actually underperforming by about 4-10%. On the contrary, an emerging economic power, China, is rising fast in the league table as well as outperforming countries with similar levels of resources."
"With growing institutional pressure from the Brazilian government to increase the impact of research that it funds, Brazilian researchers are increasingly interested in discovering factors that affect the citation of their articles. The aim of the present article was to assess the perceptions of Brazilian sustainability researchers to identify factors that influence the impacts of their research. A survey was conducted with researchers in the field of sustainability and 89 questionnaires were completed. All of those researchers have articles or research projects in the field of sustainability (mixing environmental, social and/or economical) recorded in the Scielo or Lattes Curriculum Brazilian databases. Results suggest four factors that may explain the impact of article citations: (1) ""prestige.of the author and the research network:"" (2) ""prestige of the means of publication and indexing:"" (3) ""accessibility and quality characteristics of the article:"" and (4) ""international nature of communication and scope of the study"". Surprisingly, such factors were not statistically significant in explaining the citations of the participating researchers. These results show the need to consider other factors that can explain the impact of research, discovering the missing links. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved."
"Research on the academic review process may help to improve research productivity. The article presents a model of the review process in a top journal, in which authors know their paper's quality whereas referees obtain a noisy signal about quality. Increased signal noisiness, lower submission costs and more published papers all reduce the average quality of published papers in the journal. The model allows analyzing how the submission cost, the accuracy of referees and the number of published papers affect additional equilibrium characteristics. Implications of the model for journal policies are also discussed."
"While there has been significant discussion in the health sciences and ethics literatures about problems associated with publication practices (e.g., ghost- and gift-authorship, conflicts of interest), there has been relatively little practical guidance developed to help researchers determine how they should fairly allocate credit for multi-authored publications. Fair allocation of credit requires that participating authors be acknowledged for their contribution and responsibilities, but it is not obvious what contributions should warrant authorship, nor who should be responsible for the quality and content of the scientific research findings presented in a publication. In this paper, we review arguments presented in the ethics and health science literatures, and the policies or guidelines proposed by learned societies and journals, in order to explore the link between author contribution and responsibility in multi-author multidisciplinary health science publications. We then critically examine the various procedures used in the field to help researchers fairly allocate authorship."
"We use a quality-based approach to assess contributing institutions and authors in international business (IB) research. Specifically, we use Google Scholar citations of individual articles to weigh the number of IB research articles in core IB and other non-IB elite journals. Our approach mitigates concerns about the quality difference among articles across different journals and within individual journals. We find evidence to suggest that IB research in the European and Asia-Pacific regions exhibits an upward trend over the 1995-2011 period. With respect to institutional research quality, we document that an IB program with faculty members working with their peers in foreign countries and the presence of a doctoral program can enhance an institution's research quality. Prolific authors are very mobile and typically have global experience."
"The purpose of this paper was to analyze the intellectual structure of biomedical informatics reflected in scholarly events such as conferences, workshops, symposia, and seminars. As analysis variables, 'call for paper topics', 'session titles' and author keywords from biomedical informatics-related scholarly events, and the MeSH descriptors were combined. As analysis cases, the titles and abstracts of 12,536 papers presented at five medical informatics (MI) and six bioinformatics (BI) global scale scholarly event series during the years 1999-2008 were collected. Then, n-gram terms (MI = 6,958; BI = 5,436) from the paper corpus were extracted and the term co-occurrence network was analyzed. One hundred important topics for each medical informatics and bioinformatics were identified through the hub-authority metric, and their usage contexts were compared with the k-nearest neighbor measure. To research trends, newly popular topics by 2-year period units were observed. In the past 10 years the most important topic in MI has been ""decision support"", while in BI ""gene expression"". Though the two communities share several methodologies, according to our analysis, they do not use them in the same context. This evidence suggests that MI uses technologies for the improvement of productivity in clinical settings, while BI uses algorithms as its tools for scientific biological discovery. Though MI and BI are arguably separate research fields, their topics are increasingly intertwined, and the gap between the fields blurred, forming a broad informatics-namely biomedical informatics. Using scholarly events as data sources for domain analysis is the closest way to approximate the forefront of biomedical informatics."
"Purpose - The aim of this paper is to propose a conceptual model of the field of informetrics. Specifically, the paper argues that informetrics comprises the study of entities in three dimensions: the social, documentary and epistemic dimensions containing respectively agents, documents, and concepts or cognitions. Design/methodology/approach - The paper outlines a conceptual model, drawing on earlier work by Kochen, Leydesdorff, Borgman and others. Subsequently, each dimension and interdimensional relation is analyzed and discussed. Findings - It is shown that not every study necessarily involves each of the three dimensions, but that the field as a whole cannot be reduced to one or two of them. Moreover, the dimensions should be kept separate but they are not completely independent. The paper discusses what kinds of relations exist between the dimensions. Special attention is given to the nature of the citation relation within this framework. The paper also considers the place of concepts like mapping, proximity and influence in the model. Research limitations/implications - This conceptual paper is a first step. Multi-relational networks may be a key instrument to further the study of the interplay between the three dimensions. Originality/value - The paper provides a framework to characterise informetric studies and makes the characteristics of the field explicit."
"This study introduces a new proposal to refine the classification of the SCImago Journal and Country Rank (SJR) platform by using clustering techniques and an alternative combination of citation measures from an initial 18,891 SJR journal network. Thus, a journal-journal matrix including simultaneously fractionalized values of direct citation, cocitation, and coupling was symmetrized by cosine similarity and later transformed into distances before performing clustering. The results provided a new cluster-based subject structure comprising 290 clusters that emerge by executing Ward's clustering in two phases and using a mixed labeling procedure based on tf-idf scores of the original SJR category tags and significant words extracted from journal titles. In total, 13,716 SJR journals were classified using this new cluster-based scheme. Although more than 5,000 journals were omitted in the classification process, the method produced a consistent classification with a balanced structure of coherent and well-defined clusters, a moderated multiassignment of journals, and a softer concentration of journals over clusters than in the original SJR categories. New subject disciplines such as nanoscience and nanotechnology or social work were also detected, providing evidence of good performance of our approach in refining the journal classification and updating the subject classification structure."
"Objective: The purpose of this study is to analyse Iranian scientific publications in the neuroscience subfields by librarians and neuroscientists, using Science Citation Index Expanded (SCIE) via Web of Science data over the period, 20022008. Methods: Data were retrieved from the SCIE. Data were collected from the subject area of the database and classified by neuroscience experts into 14 subfields. To identify the citation patterns, we applied the impact factor and the number of publication. Data were also analysed using HISTCITE, Excel 2007 and SPSS. Results: Seven hundred and thirty-four papers have been published by Iranian between 2002 and 2008. Findings showed a growing trend of neuroscience papers in the last 3 years with most papers (264) classified in the neuropharmacology subfield. There were fewer papers in neurohistory, psychopharmacology and artificial intelligence. International contributions of authors were mostly in the neurology subfield, and Collaboration Coefficient for the neuroscience subfields in Iran was 0.686 which is acceptable. Most international collaboration between Iranians and developed countries was from USA. Eighty-seven percent of the published papers were in journals with the impact factor between 0 and 4; 25% of papers were published by the researchers affiliated to Tehran University of Medical Sciences. Conclusion: Progress of neuroscience in Iran is mostly seen in the neuropharmacology and the neurology subfields. Other subfields should also be considered as a research priority by health policymakers. As this study was carried out by the collaboration of librarians and neuroscientists, it has been proved valuable for both librarians and policymakers. This study may be encouraging for librarians from other developing countries."
The output in research of South Africa is measured in terms of citable documents and it is investigated if this output is in line with what should be expected from a country with the population and economy of South Africa. The expected relationship is calculated by making use of the data of the top 86 countries. It was found that the research output of South Africa is very much in line with what should be expected.
"The focus of this article is on a specific aspect of the recent state of historical research in Russia: the problem of universalisation (cognitive and institutional) of Russian historical studies and the recognition of the Russian scholars' knowledge claims. Cognitive aspects of the ""restructuring"" of science, research themes, the state of the disciplinary community and communicative strategies, the position of historians in the humanities establishment and relationships with the authorities are studied. This paper aims to identify theoretical problems, which arise when studying the preconditions of and obstacles to the participation of Russian historians in the international scientific discussion. The investigation is based on the concepts of centre-periphery and cultural transfer. The key question is why, how and when the new historical knowledge developed by Russian scholars became or, as an extreme case, hase not become part of the global scientific heritage. The discussion of 'presence' in global science is connected not so much with the aftermath of autarchy during the socialist period as with the difficulties of adapting to new conditions of existence as a 'normal' discipline and the rigours of being a 'poor' science. In this article we review not only specifics of the transfer of knowledge produced by Russian historians, but also specifics of reception preceding it. This article also contains an analysis of all publications of Russian historians in foreign historical journals included in the database ""Web of Science"" in 1993-2008 which are examined combining quantitative parameters numbers of articles and their citation indices with a qualitative analysis of publications."
Background and Objectives: Words in scientific discourse must be truthful. Introducing ambiguity or creating a false narrative by insinuating close counts or almost statements as facts that appeal to a truth the writer wants to exist doesn't make it true. A reader's personal interpretation because of hedging or weasel words creates an opportunity for truthiness as a belief to become a fact when it isn't. Conclusion: Awareness by scientists of this situation will make article reading more critical and related to reality rather than what you want an author wants it to be.
"Institutional sectors - groups of centers with similar characteristics and types of R&D- constitute an interesting unit of analysis that can also serve as a useful framework for benchmarking purposes in R&D studies. The analysis of Spanish scientific output included in the Web of Science database (2000-2011) shows the predominance of Universities (66%), followed by the Public Research Organisations (OPI) (23%) and the Health Sector (18%). Non-profit organizations (ESAL) (10%), which include both Traditional Entities with non-Profit Aims (ETSAL) and new Research Structures with non-Profit Aims (EISAL), show the highest impact values, regardless of whether indicators based on impact factors (normalised position, percentage of articles in the first quartile) or on citations are used. Universities present a more evenly distributed thematic profile and it is the only sector specialized in fields such as Social Sciences, Humanities or Mathematics, while the Health Sector is highly specialized in Clinical Medicine. During the period studied, the different sectors tended to increase their scientific production, to publish in higher impact factor journals and to intensify the level of collaboration and internationalization of their publications. Especially noteworthy is the strong rise of non-profit organizations, in particular the case of EISAL, which conduct high impact research mainly in Biomedicine. No relationship has been found between the areas in which the sectors are specialized and those in which they obtain the highest impact."
"Using curriculum vitae (CVs) or Short Bios in published resources such as the Internet enables us to analyze many issues concerning researchers' careers. However, analysis of CVs or Short Bios concerning researchers' life history, such as movement between countries, has rarely been conducted. In this paper, we pursue two purposes: to demonstrate which conditions (citation impact, countries or sectors) are favorable for the analysis, and to show structures of production of highly cited papers. To grasp more obvious tendencies, we compare two ``extreme'' samples: highly cited and uncited papers. First, we assess the identification rates of researchers' origin broken down by researchers' affiliation (countries and sectors). Then, we analyze the influence of these researchers' international movement based on their origin. The results show the full landscape of the movement's influence on national publication, the characteristics of each country in terms of researchers' countries of origin and the research experience of both internationally moved and domestic researchers. Moreover, we analyze the contributions of researchers who returned from abroad to their home countries. Finally, we assess the limitations of our research method and the topic to be addressed concerning this method."
"The present article aims to scrutinize publishing ethics in the fields of paediatrics and paediatric nursing. Full-text readings of all original research articles in paediatrics from a high-income economy, i.e. Sweden, and from all low-income economies in Sub-Saharan Africa, were reviewed as they were indexed and stored in Web of Science for the search period from 1 January 2007 to 7 October 2009. The application of quantitative and qualitative content analysis revealed a marked discrepancy in publishing frequencies between the two contrasting economies. Authors from 16 low-income economies in Sub-Saharan Africa, with at least one article stored, were obviously closely linked to co-authorships and foreign funding sources, predominantly from Europe and the USA. Statements concerning conflicts of interest were frequently missing (both regions), even when multiple financial sources, including companies, were involved. It is necessary to be aware of possible systematic bias when using electronic databases to search for certain topics and regions. Further research regarding publishing ethics in paediatrics and paediatric nursing is emphasized."
"This review explores contributions by science policy studies and the sociology of science to our understanding of the impact of governance on research content. Contributions are subsumed under two perspectives, namely an impact ofperspective that searches for effects of specific governance arrangements and an impact onperspective that asks what factors contribute to the construction of research content and includes governance among them. Our review shows that little is known so far about the impact of governance on knowledge content. A research agenda does not necessarily need to include additional empirical phenomena but must address the macro-micro-macro link inherent to the question in its full complexity, and systematically exploit comparative approaches in order to establish causality. This requires interdisciplinary collaboration between science policy studies, the sociology of science, and bibliometrics, which all can contribute to the necessary analytical toolbox."
"We analyzed comparative trends in research performance of the Russian institutions based on the quantitative and qualitative data available in the international SciVal, Scopus, web of science and the national Russian databases from 2012 to December 2017. Russian Federation represented 2.0% of the world population and 2% of the researchers while accounting to 2.2% of the world publications (14th place in the world scholarly output) with overall field-weighted citation impact of 0.75. Scholarly output of the Russian authors increased by 79%, field-weighted citation impact by 12% and outputs in top citation percentiles by 21% but without a statistically significant positive association between higher investment in research and development and the increase the national GDP. Scholarly output for the Russian publications in mathematics, physics and astronomy are among 5 top countries. However, field-weighted mass media impact, the number of citations per publication, citations per author and per publication, metrics of international collaboration and the academic-corporation collaboration and economic impact of the Russian research remain low. Routine analysis of the research performance and economic impact of R&D expenditure should be reflected in transparent distribution of state research funding. Legal aspects of the international research must be developed to ensure a complete integration of the Russian science into international research activities."
"The objective of this work is to describe the distribution of different types of participating organizations in the health thematic area of the 6th Framework Programme. A total of 2132 different organizations were classified according to four types and then grouped by country. A Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was carried out on the percentage of funding obtained by each type of organization. Results show a countries map plotted around the ""private"" and ""public"" principal components. It is observed that there are countries which research is basically performed by government research centres, while others are supported in the university activity. We conclude that the PCA is a suitable method to plot the distribution of research organizations by country and the results could be used as a tool for theoretical studies about the scientific activity in a country."
The study examined research and trends in career counselling published in selected professional sources during the period 1980-2010 Citation analysis was used in this study to investigate documents which were indexed In the Web of Science related to career counselling Career counselling and related keywords were used jointly in the search for documents There were a total of 730 documents judged to be relevant to the field of career counselling and were citation analysed The number of citations related to the career counselling field has been increasing continuously since 2000 Research publications on career counselling are projected to increase for both South African authors and the authors of other African countries
"Significant growth has been seen in the field of anaesthesiology in recent decades. The current geographic distribution of the publications on anaesthesia research may be different from ten years ago. We performed this literature survey to examine the national origin of articles published in international anaesthesiology journals and to evaluate their contribution to anaesthesia research. Articles published in 18 major anaesthesiology journals from 2000 to 2009 were identified from the PubMed database and the Science Citation Index. A total of 30,191 articles were published in the selected 18 journals from 2000 to 2009. The country responsible for the largest number of articles was the United States of America (29.4%), followed by the United Kingdom, Germany, Japan, Canada, Australia and France. Denmark, Switzerland and Finland had the largest number of articles per capita. Anesthesia & Analgesia published the most number of articles from 2000 to 2009, followed by Anesthesiology, Pain and the British Journal of Anaesthesia. The numbers of clinical studies and randomised controlled trials decreased markedly from 2000 to 2009."
"The debate on whether the peer-review system is in crisis has been heated recently. A variety of alternative systems have been proposed to improve the system and make it sustainable. However, we lack sufficient evidence and data related to these issues. Here we used a previously developed agent-based model of the scientific publication and peer-review system calibrated with empirical data to compare the efficiency of five alternative peer-review systems with the conventional system. We modelled two systems of immediate publication, with and without online reviews (crowdsourcing), a system with only one round of reviews and revisions allowed (re-review opt-out) and two review-sharing systems in which rejected manuscripts are resubmitted along with their past reviews to any other journal (portable) or to only those of the same publisher but of lower impact factor (cascade). The review-sharing systems outperformed or matched the performance of the conventional one in all peer-review efficiency, reviewer effort and scientific dissemination metrics we used. The systems especially showed a large decrease in total time of the peer-review process and total time devoted by reviewers to complete all reports in a year. The two systems with immediate publication released more scientific information than the conventional one but provided almost no other benefit. Re-review opt-out decreased the time reviewers devoted to peer review but had lower performance on screening papers that should not be published and relative increase in intrinsic quality of papers due to peer review than the conventional system. Sensitivity analyses showed consistent findings to those from our main simulations. We recommend prioritizing a system of review-sharing to create a sustainable scientific publication and peer-review system."
"Bibliometric studies have found that male researchers have their greatest productivity around the age of 40, that female researchers produce less than their male colleagues, that incentives for collaboration are slow to affect productivity and that, just like humans, research institutes become larger, less productive, more expensive to maintain and less able to raise money as they grow old. Almost invariably, these conclusions come from statistical studies of large numbers of European and American scientists, and there are practically no studies about tropical researchers. We present an in-depth analysis of the productivity of an internationally recognized tropical botanist and conservationist, Luis Diego Gomez Pignataro, based on the totality of his published work and on our own knowledge, as co-workers and friends, of the life frame in which that scientific output was produced. His life output departs from the expected pattern in that he had the highest productivity before reaching the expected peak productivity age, and that when he reached it his productivity fell and never recovered. Furthermore, marriage did not produce the expected fall in productivity. A close analysis of his life indicates that in the middle of his career he switched to intense teaching and conservation activities, and this better explains why his output of scientific research articles was low afterwards. This switch may occur in other tropical scientists. Rev. Biol. Trop. 58 (4): 1093-1114. Epub 2010 December 01."
"2,215 publications covering the period going from 1959 to 2011, with at least one author affiliated to Benin, were searched from Scopus and analyzed. These publications were co-authored by 10,225 scientists that correspond to 5,122 single authors in several disciplines of which the most prolific are Agricultural and biological science, and Medicine. None of the Benin-based journals were indexed in Scopus; approximately 5 % of the publications appeared in African reviews covered by Scopus. Researchers' home institutions are mainly the University of Abomey-Calavi, its laboratories and some international organizations or cooperation agencies. The private universities were not mentioned in the affiliations list. The yearly percentage of international collaboration is over 80 %; France, the former colonial power is the main research partner whereas the West African region is the main partner at the African continent level; others partners are from Europe and America continents. This study suggests the setting up of a national database to index the domestic scientific literature; it should contribute to the improvement of the national research output."
"Individual researchers and the organisations for which they work are interested in comparative measures of research performance for a variety of purposes. Such comparisons are facilitated by quantifiable measures that are easily obtained and offer convenience and a sense of objectivity. One popular measure is the journal impact factor, based on citation rates, but it is a measure intended for journals rather than individuals. Moreover, educational research publications are not well represented in the databases most widely used for calculation of citation measures, leading to doubts about the usefulness of such measures in education. Newer measures and data sources offer alternatives that provide wider representation of education research. However, research has shown that citation rates vary according to discipline and that valid comparisons depend upon the availability of discipline-specific benchmarks. This study sought to provide such benchmarks for Australian educational researchers based on analysis of citation measures obtained for the Australian education professoriate."
"Scientists are frequently faced with the important decision to start or terminate a creative partnership. This process can be influenced by strategic motivations, as early career researchers are pursuers, whereas senior researchers are typically attractors, of new collaborative opportunities. Focusing on the longitudinal aspects of scientific collaboration, we analyzed 473 collaboration profiles using an egocentric perspective that accounts for researcher-specific characteristics and provides insight into a range of topics, from career achievement and sustainability to team dynamics and efficiency. From more than 166,000 collaboration records, we quantify the frequency distributions of collaboration duration and tie strength, showing that collaboration networks are dominated by weak ties characterized by high turnover rates. We use analytic extreme value thresholds to identify a new class of indispensable super ties, the strongest of which commonly exhibit >50% publication overlap with the central scientist. The prevalence of super ties suggests that they arise from career strategies based upon cost, risk, and reward sharing and complementary skill matching. We then use a combination of descriptive and panel regression methods to compare the subset of publications coauthored with a super tie to the subset without one, controlling for pertinent features such as career age, prestige, team size, and prior group experience. We find that super ties contribute to above-average productivity and a 17% citation increase per publication, thus identifying these partnerships-the analog of life partners-as a major factor in science career development."
"Despite general agreement within philosophy that peer review is indispensable, its fairness and reliability is often questioned. This article suggests that such worries can to a large extent be met by adopting the practice that reviews as well as earlier versions of papers are made publicly available when the final version of a paper is published. This suggestion combines the advantages of transparency with the merits of anonymity of reviewers. While there are obstacles to this suggestion, the article argues that it would be worthwhile to implement it because it can help map patterns of conduct and secure confidence in the fairness and reliability of review procedures and journal editing within philosophy."
"Peer review has been in place for centuries as an accepted process to validate manuscripts submitted for publication in scientific journals. Yet a similarly rigorous assessment of content also happens a level up, when looking at the quality of journals that apply for indexing in bibliographic databases. Scopus, an abstract & citation database provided by Elsevier, indexing 18,000 scientific titles, is receiving an increasing number of title suggestions; in 2009 this grew to almost 5,000 in that year alone. Some of the suggested journals are dedicated to niche areas and/or are published in other languages than English. To ensure a fair and transparent evaluation of these titles and to address the rising interest in being indexed, Scopus redesigned its entire title evaluation process basing it on a metrical scorecard and on the principles of peer review. By developing an online editorial system - the Scopus Title Evaluation Platform (STEP) - Scopus also created the prerequisite of an improved communication with publishers and editors about their journals.

"Background The importance of peer review in the furthering of science cannot be overstated. However, most doctoral students and early career professionals receive little formal or informal training in conducting peer reviews. Purpose In recognition of this deficit in peer reviewer training, the present article was developed to provide an overview of the peer-review process at Annals of Behavioral Medicine and describe the general and specific elements that should be included in a high-quality review for the journal. Conclusion We conclude by offering exemplar reviews of a manuscript that was ultimately accepted for publication in the journal and provide commentary on specific aspects of these reviews."
"Here we use co-word analysis on extant literature to map the intellectual structure of research addressing the impact of economic transition on Central and Eastern European enterprises during the 1989-2013 period. We collected and analyzed 2053 scholarly papers from the most comprehensive management databases, which were then used to develop. This paper contributes to the economic transition literature by providing an empirically derived framework based on the extant literature. This framework describes the main factors affecting enterprises during the transition process, the relationships among these factors and their evolution. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved."
"While information management in research and libraries used to be dominated by the handling of literature, nowadays many new tools are available. The advent of office products, databases and online platforms have not only radically changed the day-today work in research and libraries, but in some cases introduced entirely new fields of academic information practice: in the contexts of bibliometrics, virtual research environments or research data, for example. This article compares current research information practice with library training courses. It argues that the two have become divergent and that the provision of a coherent range of on-campus academic information practice services has come under threat. Two proposals are made to counteract such trends: firstly, that libraries collaborate with computing centres and academic faculties to establish services that foster information practices and secondly that libraries continue to establish themselves as centres of learning and research information management. New methods in the teaching of information skills need to be explored, such as direct involvement in academic projects, supporting staff initiatives and targeted recruiting strategies, and the coordinated sharing of expertise and materials between libraries."
"This paper aims to study the collaboration among researchers in a specific Italian program funding, the Projects of National Interest (PRIN), which supports the academic research. The paper uses two approaches to study the dynamic complex networks: first it identifies the observed distribution of links among researchers in the four areas of interest (chemistry, physics, economics and sociology) through distribution models, then it uses a stochastic model to understand how the links change over time. The analysis is based on large and unique dataset on 4322 researchers from 98 universities and research institutes that have been selected for PRIN allocation from 2000 to 2011. The originality of this work is that we have studied a competitive funding schemes through dynamic network analysis techniques."
The integrity of the research enterprise is of the utmost importance for the advancement of safe and effective medical practice for patients and for maintaining the public trust in health care. Academic societies and editors of journals are key participants in guarding scientific integrity. Avoiding and preventing plagiarism helps to preserve the scientific integrity of professional presentations and publications. The Society for Academic Emergency Medicine (SAEM) Ethics Committee discusses current issues in scientific publishing integrity and provides a guideline to avoid plagiarism in SAEM presentations and publications.
"In science, a relatively small pool of researchers garners a disproportionally large number of citations. Still, very little is known about the social characteristics of highly cited scientists. This is unfortunate as these researchers wield a disproportional impact on their fields, and the study of highly cited scientists can enhance our understanding of the conditions which foster highly cited work, the systematic social inequalities which exist in science, and scientific careers more generally. This study provides information on this understudied subject by examining the social characteristics and opinions of the 0.1% most cited environmental scientists and ecologists. Overall, the social characteristics of these researchers tend to reflect broader patterns of inequality in the global scientific community. However, while the social characteristics of these researchers mirror those of other scientific elites in important ways, they differ in others, revealing findings which are both novel and surprising, perhaps indicating multiple pathways to becoming highly cited."
"Paying to publish is an ethical issue. During 2010-14, Indian researchers have used 488 open access (OA) journals levying article processing charge (APC), ranging from US$7.5 to 5,000, to publish about 15,400 papers. Use of OA journals levying APC has increased from 242 journals and 2,557 papers in 2010 to 328 journals and 3,634 papers in 2014. We estimate that India is potentially spending about US$2.4 million annually on APCs paid to OA journals and the amount would be much more if we add APCs paid to make papers published in hybrid journals open access. It would be prudent for Indian authors to make their work freely available through interoperable repositories, a trend that is growing in Latin America and China, especially when funding is scarce. Scientists are ready to pay APC as long as institutions pay for it and funding agencies are not ready to insist that grants provided for research should not be used for paying APC."
"Background and Purpose-This is the first bibliometric comparison between countries of the development of stroke research over time. Methods-Clinical and epidemiological articles on stroke published 2001 to mid-2011 were identified in Science Citation Index Expanded. Article fractions, citation fractions, h-index, and international collaboration were calculated using the BibExcel software and adjusted for population size and gross domestic product. Results-The United States dominated with 28.7% of the sum of article fractions and 36.2% of the sum of citation fractions. The United States, Japan, the United Kingdom, and Germany together accounted for 52.1% of articles and 61.0% of citations. When adjusted for population size or gross domestic product, several small European countries, together with Israel and Taiwan, ranked the highest. Per population, there was a negative association (r=0.60) between burden of stroke (disability-adjusted life-years lost) and number of articles per population. In China, South Korea, and Singapore, the annual growth of stroke articles was more than twice the worldwide average. Whereas multinational collaboration was common within Europe and North America, it was relatively uncommon between Asian countries. Conclusions-The Big 4 in scientific literature on stroke, as to both number of articles and citations, are the United States, Japan, the United Kingdom, and Germany. Many small European countries have, in relation to their size, a high scientific production. Several countries with rapidly expanding economies have very fast growth of scientific production on stroke. Our results emphasize the need for stroke research in countries with a high population burden of stroke and they highlight the role of multinational collaboration. (Stroke. 2012;43:830-837.)"
"The growth in scientific production may threaten the capacity for the scientific community to handle the ever-increasing demand for peer review of scientific publications. There is little evidence regarding the sustainability of the peer-review system and how the scientific community copes with the burden it poses. We used mathematical modeling to estimate the overall quantitative annual demand for peer review and the supply in biomedical research. The modeling was informed by empirical data from various sources in the biomedical domain, including all articles indexed at MEDLINE. We found that for 2015, across a range of scenarios, the supply exceeded by 15% to 249% the demand for reviewers and reviews. However, 20% of the researchers performed 69% to 94% of the reviews. Among researchers actually contributing to peer review, 70% dedicated 1% or less of their research work time to peer review while 5% dedicated 13% or more of it. An estimated 63.4 million hours were devoted to peer review in 2015, among which 18.9 million hours were provided by the top 5% contributing reviewers. Our results support that the system is sustainable in terms of volume but emphasizes a considerable imbalance in the distribution of the peer-review effort across the scientific community. Finally, various individual interactions between authors, editors and reviewers may reduce to some extent the number of reviewers who are available to editors at any point."
"The journal Acta Clinica Croatica (ACC) was founded in 1962 under the title Anali Bolnice Dr. M. Stojanovic In 1995, the title of the journal was changed into its present form and ever since all papers have been published in English. In 2000, the electronic (online) edition of the ACC was released in addition to the print version. The paper presents development of the journal from 1962 to 2012 based on the analysis of the following SCOPUS citation index parameters: type and number of documents published in the journal; number of citations; and number of domestic and foreign authors. The studied period was analyzed in three time segments: the period from 1995 to 1999, the period from 2000 to 2006 and the period from 2007 to 2012. The same parameters were analyzed in the Web of Science/SCI-Expanded bibliographic and citation index for the 2007-2012 period. The increasing number of documents, authors (both domestic and foreign) and citations demonstrates gradual rise in the quality, visibility and impact of the journal. The fifty years of experience show that a goal, at first very distant and almost unachievable, may be reached by progressing step by step."
"I provide a brief discussion of the Handelsblatt ranking by focusing on its journal quality weights. I summarize the methodology underlying journals' prestige measure, which is derived from their citation networks, and discuss its strengths and shortcomings. Although I agree that Handelsblatt ranking provides a great service to the profession, that same profession needs to be rather careful not to overemphasize the journal quality weights."
"The international dissemination of quality research constitutes one of the main challenges for editorial boards of scientific publications. Among these is PNA, a Spanish journal on mathematics education research. In this paper we present insights on this issue from our experience as members of the PNA editorial board. By describing the process followed for giving international visibility to the journal and for guaranteeing its scientific quality, we aim to provide some operative points of reference to be used in new projects intending to disseminate quality research production."
"A relation, established by Andras Schubert (Scientometrics 78(3): 559-565, 2009) on the relation between a paper's h-index and its total number of received citations, is explained. The relation is a concavely increasing power law and is explained based on the Lotkaian model for the h-index, proved by Egghe and Rousseau."
"In this Research Commentary, we describe 3 journal metrics the Web of Science's Impact Factor, Scopus's SClmago Journal Rank, and Google Scholar Metrics' h5-index-and compile the rankings (if they exist) for 69 mathematics education journals. We then discuss 2 paths that the mathematics education community should consider with regard to these citation-based metrics of journal quality: either working within the system to enhance our positioning or resisting or modifying the system itself."
"In this paper we propose a new family of cumulative indexes for measuring scientific performance which can be applied to many metrics, including h index and its variants (here we apply it to the h index, h(2) index and Google Scholar's i10 index). These indexes follow the general principle of repeating the index calculation for the same publication set. Using bibliometric data and reviewer scores for accepted and rejected fellowship applicants we examine how valid the cumulative variant is compared to the original variant. These analyses showed that the cumulative indexes result in higher correlations with the reviewer scores than their original variants. Thus, the cumulative indexes better reflect the assessments by peers than the original variants and are useful extensions of the original indexes. In contrast to many other measures of scientific performance proposed up to now, the cumulative indexes seem not only to be effective, but they are also easy to understand and calculate."
"Let us consider that someone is starting a research on a topic that is unfamiliar to them. Which seminal papers have influenced the topic the most? What is the genealogy of the seminal papers in this topic? These are the questions that they can raise, which we try to answer in this paper. First, we propose an algorithm that finds a set of seminal papers on a given topic. We also address the performance and scalability issues of this sophisticated algorithm. Next, we discuss the measures to decide how much a paper is influenced by another paper. Then, we propose an algorithm that constructs a genealogy of the seminal papers by using the influence measure and citation information. Finally, through extensive experiments with a large volume of a real-world academic literature data, we show the effectiveness and efficiency of our approach."
"An aim of science is to find truths about reality. These truths are collected together to form systematic knowledge structures called theories. Theories are intended to create a truthful picture of the reality behind the study. Together with all the other fields of science we get a (complete) scientific picture or a world view. This scientific world view is open in the sense that not all truths are known by scientists and not all present day theories are true. So, there is no reason to assume that any field of science has been or will be completed; science is essentially progressive, or an open ended approach. Science is not the only method of picturing, but the view that science is the best human method for knowledge acquisition is well justified. Knowledge is not all we humans are looking for; we need to make our lives meaningful. The meaningfulness may be achieved through science, art, or practical activity. It is interesting to compare literature and science. Both are expressed linguistically, but the aims of literature and science seem to be very different. We are looking for the theoretical interconnection between science and literature, but the proper dialogue can be found not through science, literature or philosophy, but through pedagogy."
"Using data generated by progressive nucleation mechanism on the cumulative fraction of citations of individual papers published successively by a hypothetical author, an expression for the time dependence of the cumulative number L-sum(t) of citations of progressively published papers is proposed. It was found that, for all nonzero values of constant publication rate Delta N, the cumulative citations L-sum(t) of the cumulative N papers published by an author in his/her entire publication career spanning over T years may be represented in distinct regions: (1) in the region 0 < t < Theta(0) (where Theta(0) approximate to T/3), L-sum(t) slowly increases proportionally to the square of the citation time t, and (2) in the region t > Theta(0), L-sum(t) approaches a constant L-sum(max) at T. In the former region, the time dependence of L-sum(t) of an author is associated with three parameters, viz, the citability parameter), the publication rate Delta N and his/her publication career t. Based on the predicted dependence of L-sum(t) on t, a useful scientometric age-independent measure, defined as citation acceleration a = L-sum(t)/t(2), is suggested to analyze and compare the scientific activities of different authors. Confrontation of the time dependence of cumulative number L-sum(t) of citations of papers with the theoretical equation reveals one or more citation periods during the publication careers of different authors.

"We analysed the authorship policies of a random sample of 600 journals from the Journal Citation Reports database. 62.5% of the journals we sampled had an authorship policy. Having an authorship policy was positively associated with impact factor. Journals from the biomedical sciences and social sciences/humanities were more likely to have an authorship policy than journals from the physical sciences, engineering or mathematical sciences. Among journals with a policy, the most frequent type of policy was guidance on criteria for authorship (99.7%); followed by guidance on acknowledgments (97.3%); requiring that authors make substantial contributions to the research (94.7%); requiring that authors be accountable for the research as a whole (84.8%); guidance on changes in authorship (77.9%); requiring that authors give final approval to the manuscript (77.6%); requiring that authors draft or critically revise the manuscript (71.7%); providing guidance on corporate authorship (58.9%); prohibiting gift, guest or ghost authorship (31.7%); requiring authors to describe their contributions (5.3%); limiting the number of authors for some types of articles (4.0%) and requiring authors to be accountable for their part in the research (1.1%). None of the policies addressed equal contribution statements. Journals that do not have authorship policies should consider adopting or developing ones."
"Background: Evidence-based practice is a foundation to clinical excellence. However there remains little evidence on the characteristics of authors who contribute to the evidence-base and whether these have changed over time. The purpose of this study was to explore these characteristics by undertaking a bibliometric analysis to explore publication and authorship characteristics in a leading sub-speciality orthopaedic journal (The Knee) over a 20-year period. Methods: All articles published in The Knee in 1996, 2006 and 2016 were identified. For each article, data collected included: highest academic award; profession; gender; continent of first and last author; total number of authors; the level of evidence; and funding source. We analysed temporal changes in these variables using appropriate statistical models. Results: A total of 413 papers were analysed. Between 1996 to 2016 there has been a significant increase in the overall number of authors, the number of paper submitted from Asia, the proportion of Level 1 or 2 tiered evidence, the proportion of people with Bachelor or Master-level degrees as their highest level of educational award and the proportion of non-medically qualified authors (P < 0.001). From 2006 to 2016 there was a significant increase in the proportion of articles whose first author was female (P = 0.03), but no significant change in the number of females as last author (P = 0.43). Conclusion: The findings indicate that there have been changes in publication and authorship characteristics in this sub-speciality orthopaedic journal during the past 20 years. This provides encouraging indication of greater diversification and internationalisation of orthopaedic research. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."
"Purpose - Although journal rankings are important for authors, readers, publishers, promotion, and tenure committees, it has been argued that the use of different measures (e.g. the journal impact factor (JIF), and Hirsch's h-index) often lead to different journal rankings, which render it difficult to make an appropriate decision. A hybrid ranking method based on the Borda count approach, the Standardized Average Index (SA index), was introduced to solve this problem. The paper aims to discuss these issues. Design/methodology/approach - Citations received by the articles published in 85 Health Care Sciences and Services (HCSS) journals in the period of 2009-2013 were analyzed with the use of the JIF, the h-index, and the SA index. Findings - The SA index exhibits a high correlation with the JIF and the h-index (gamma > 0.9, p < 0.01) and yields results with higher accuracy than the h-index. The new, comprehensive citation impact analysis of the 85 HCSS journals shows that the SA index can help researchers to find journals with both high JIFs and high h-indices more easily, thereby harvesting references for paper submissions and research directions. Originality/value - The contribution of this study is the application of the Borda count approach to combine the HCSS journal rankings produced by the two widely accepted indices of the JIF and the h-index. The new HCSS journal rankings can be used by publishers, journal editors, researchers, policymakers, librarians, and practitioners as a reference for journal selection and the establishment of decisions and professional judgment."
"In recent years bibliometricians have paid increasing attention to research evaluation methodological problems, among these being the choice of the most appropriate indicators for evaluating quality of scientific publications, and thus for evaluating the work of single scientists, research groups and entire organizations. Much literature has been devoted to analyzing the robustness of various indicators, and many works warn against the risks of using easily available and relatively simple proxies, such as journal impact factor. The present work continues this line of research, examining whether it is valid that the use of the impact factor should always be avoided in favour of citations, or whether the use of impact factor could be acceptable, even preferable, in certain circumstances. The evaluation was conducted by observing all scientific publications in the hard sciences by Italian universities, for the period 2004-2007. Performance sensitivity analyses were conducted with changing indicators of quality and years of observation."
"Objective: To evaluate the quality pertaining to the various structural components and aspects of research articles published in Iranian journals of dentistry in the first six months of the year 2006. Methodology: This descriptive study assessed the quality of 100 original articles published in Iranian Journals of dentistry in terms of their various structural components including abstracts, introductions, methodology, results, discussions and references. Based on 52 variables the articles were classified into three categories of ""adequate"", ""relatively adequate"" and ""inadequate"". Data analysis was done using Chi-square statistical test. Results: The mean number of authors for each article was 2.9 +/- 0.84. Failure rate to report the ""reliability"" of the instrument of measurement was 96%, followed by failure to justify the sample size (93%). Justification for publication was not reported in 73% of the articles and 87% didn't cite the limitations and valuable findings of the study. No statistically significant association was found between the quality of published articles and study designs, number of authors and references (P<0.3). Conclusion: Significant quality related issues of concern were observed in articles published in Iranian dental journals. Attention to and rectification of these, by authors, reviewers and editors will improve the quality of future publications."
"One of the critical issues in national research assessment exercises concerns the choice of whether to evaluate the entire scientific portfolio of the institutions or a subset composed of the best products. Under the second option, the capacities of the institutions to select the appropriate researchers and their best products (the UK case) or simply the best products of every researcher (the Italian case) becomes critical, both for purposes of correct assessment of the real quality of research in the institutions evaluated, and for the selective funding that follows. In this work, through case studies of three Italian universities, we analyze the efficiency of the product selection that is intended to maximize the universities' scores in the current national research assessment exercise, the results of which will be the basis for assigning an important share of public financing over the coming years."
"Background: General practitioners and medical specialists mainly rely on one ""general medical"" journal to keep their medical knowledge up to date. Nevertheless, it is not known if these journals display the same overview of the medical knowledge in different specialties. The aims of this study were to measure the relative weight of the different specialties in the major journals of general medicine, to evaluate the trends in these weights over a ten-year period and to compare the journals. Methods: The 14,091 articles published in The Lancet, the NEJM, the JAMA and the BMJ in 1997, 2002 and 2007 were analyzed. The relative weight of the medical specialities was determined by categorization of all the articles, using a categorization algorithm which inferred the medical specialties relevant to each article MEDLINE file from the MeSH terms used by the indexers of the US National Library of Medicine to describe each article. Results: The 14,091 articles included in our study were indexed by 22,155 major MeSH terms, which were categorized into 81 different medical specialties. Cardiology and Neurology were in the first 3 specialties in the 4 journals. Five and 15 specialties were systematically ranked in the first 10 and first 20 in the four journals respectively. Among the first 30 specialties, 23 were common to the four journals. For each speciality, the trends over a 10-year period were different from one journal to another, with no consistency and no obvious explanatory factor. Conclusions: Overall, the representation of many specialties in the four journals in general and internal medicine included in this study may differ, probably due to different editorial policies. Reading only one of these journals may provide a reliable but only partial overview."
"The journal impact factor (JIF) reported in journal citation reports has been used to represent the influence and prestige of a journal. Whereas the consideration of the stochastic nature of a statistic is a prerequisite for statistical inference, the estimation of JIF uncertainty is necessary yet unavailable for comparing the impact among journals. Using journals in the Database of Research in Science Education (DoRISE), the current study proposes bootstrap methods to estimate the JIF variability. The paper also provides a comprehensive exposition of the sources of JIF variability. The collections of articles in the year of interest and in the preceding years both contribute to JIF variability. In addition, the variability estimate differs depending on the way a database selects its journals for inclusion. In the bootstrap process, the nested structure of articles in a journal was accounted for to ensure that each bootstrap replication reflects the actual citation characteristics of articles in the journal. In conclusion, the proposed point and interval estimates of the JIF statistic are obtained and more informative inferences on the impact of journals can be drawn. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

"The main objective of this study is to analyze the relationship between research impact and the structural properties of co-author networks. A new bibliographic source, Microsoft Academic Search, is introduced to test its suitability for bibliometric analyses. Citation counts and 500 one-step ego networks were extracted from this engine. Results show that tiny and sparse networks - characterized by a high Betweenness centrality and a high Average path length - achieved more citations per document than dense and compact networks described by a high Clustering coefficient and a high Average degree. According to disciplinary differences, Mathematics, Social Sciences and Economics & Business are the disciplines with more sparse and tiny networks; while Physics, Engineering and Geosciences are characterized by dense and crowded networks. This suggests that in sparse ego networks, the central author have more control on their collaborators being more selective in their recruitment and concluding that this behaviour has positive implications in the research impact.

"Two methods for comparing impact factors and citation rates across fields of science are tested against each other using citations to the 3,705 journals in the Science Citation Index 2010 (CD-Rom version of SCI) and the 13 field categories used for the Science and Engineering Indicators of the U. S. National Science Board. We compare (a) normalization by counting citations in proportion to the length of the reference list (1/N of references) with (b) rescaling by dividing citation scores by the arithmetic mean of the citation rate of the cluster. Rescaling is analytical and therefore independent of the quality of the attribution to the sets, whereas fractional counting provides an empirical strategy for normalization among sets (by evaluating the between-group variance). By the fairness test of Radicchi and Castellano (2012a), rescaling outperforms fractional counting of citations for reasons that we consider."
"A citation analysis of publications produced by the Department of Atmospheric Sciences faculty at Texas A&M University was conducted. This study included a detailed analysis of 5,082 cited publications by source, format, and age. TAMU Libraries holdings were then assessed using the works cited within the context of the 80/20 rule. The sources cited were primarily journals (91 percent) and books (5 percent). Eighty percent of the cited journal articles were fulfilled by just 24 journal titles, thus adhering to the 80/20 rule. The results were compared to those of previous citation studies in the sciences, with implications for collection management."
"In this contribution, we measure how long researchers are willing to wait (WTW) for an editorial decision on the acceptance or rejection of a submitted manuscript. This measure serves as a proxy for the expected value of a publication to a researcher in the field of economic, business and financial history. We analyze how this WTW measure varies with the characteristics of the submitting authors themselves. We distinguish the impact of personal characteristics (including age, gender and geographic location) as well as work-related characteristics (including research discipline, affiliation and academic position). To identify the factors determining economic history authors' WTW for editorial decisions, we use a valuation technique known as stated choice experiments. Our results show that respondents found the standing of the journal to be at least as important as its ISI impact factor. Moreover, we find differences in publication culture between economic and history departments. Overall, researchers' willingness to wait is influenced to a greater extent by the research discipline in which the respondents are active (history vs. economics), than by their personal characteristics (e.g. the education or the type of Ph.D. they obtained)."
"Cahiers Agricultures is an international scientific journal. It publishes articles on agronomic research and also includes human and social sciences in the field of rural development. It is well referenced in international databases and has been indexed in the Web of Science (WoS) since 2006. This database, associated with the Journal Citation Reports (R) (JCR), can be used to develop bibliometric indicators for journals derived from the citation analysis. The article presents the indicators for Cahiers Agricultures, as well as other analyses, so that the journal's readers and authors know where it ranks among the journals with an impact factor in the same scientific field. Two types of results are presented. The production indicators show how the journal is referenced in the Web of Science. An analysis of the authors' affiliations shows that there is a great deal of collaboration between research organisations from the North and the South. The indicators for visibility and impact, which are derived from an analysis of citations received for the articles in Cahiers Agricultures, provide an overview of the journal's position internationally. The bibliometric analysis proposes different priority actions to improve the journal's referencing and visibility."
"Born out of the Human Genome Project (HGP), the field of genomics evolved with phenomenal speed into a dominant scientific and business force. While other efforts were intent on estimating the economic impact of the genomics revolution, we shift focus to the social and cultural capital generated by bridging together biology and computing two of the constitutive disciplines of ""genomics"". We quantify this capital by measuring the pervasiveness of bio-computing cross-disciplinarity (XD) in genomics research during and after the HGP. To provide interlocking perspectives at the career and epistemic levels, we assembled three data sets to measure XD via (i) the collaboration network between 4190 biology and computing faculty from 155 departments in the United States, (ii) cross departmental affiliations within a comprehensive set of human genomics publications, and (iii) the application of computational concepts and methods in research published in a preeminent genomics journal. Our results show the following: First, research featuring XD collaborations has higher citation impact than other disciplinary research an effect observed at both the career and individual article levels. Second, genomics articles featuring XD methods tend to have higher citation impact than epistemically pure articles. Third, XD researchers of computing pedigree are drawn to the biology culture. This statistical evidence acquires deeper meaning when viewed against the organizational and knowledge transfer mechanisms revealed by the data models. With cross-disciplinary initiatives set to dominate the agenda of funding agencies, our case study provides a framework for appreciating the long-term effects of these initiatives on science and its standard-bearers."
"Introduction Drug consumption has become a social problem requiring political, social, and educational intervention in its prevention and treatment. In Latin America, the drug problem is highly related to the violence and the social exclusion of the metropolis. Forty percent of the 15-year-olds already smoke. On average, each person in the general population consumes approximately 6 kg of alcohol per year: the highest value in the less developed world. Meanwhile, in Spain, over a million people experience significant difficulties related to drug consumption (not including the effects of tobacco) in relation to health, family, labor, and social issues. In 2006, one out of 10 young people between the ages 14 and 18 consumed alcohol in an abusive manner more than four or five days per month. Drug consumption is a very complex, multi-factor issue with multiple economic, social, cultural, and personal implications. The most visible negative effects are observed in health issues and personal relationships. In the public scope, the most negative effects are related to important direct and indirect economic expenses, including the treatment and prevention of drug dependency, the reduction in labor productivity, the increase in charity, the fight against the delinquency, and the trafficking of drugs. The present study examines whether or not there is a correspondence between the social, public health, and political importance of drug dependency and the basic and applied research in Spanish and Latin American scientific literature. There are two objectives for this investigation: first, to quantify the scientific investigation of drug dependency in the last four years in Latin American clinical psychology and psychiatry journals, included in the Journal Citation Reports (JCR). The second objective is to state the differences between the journals in relation to the applied methodology, the type of sample used, and the principal topic of discourse. Method The units of analysis were articles published by journals selected between the years 2005 and 2008. The following journals were included: Revista Internacional de Psicologia Clinica y de la Salud / International Journal of Clinical and Health Psychology, Salud Mental, Revista Argentina de Clinica Psicologica, Revista Latinoamericana de Psicopatologia Fundamental, Actas Espanolas de Psiquiatria, Arquivos do Neuro-Psiquiatria, Revista Brasileira de Psiquiatria, and Revista do Psiquiatria Clinica. All articles of theoretical or empirical character whose title indicated the topic of drug dependency were included in this descriptive study of document analysis. The articles were analyzed and compared on the basis of five variables: the number and proportion of articles on drug dependency and substance abuse in relation to the total number of articles published by each journal during the given time period; the type of methodology; the type of sample; the type of drug studied; and the central findings. Results Out of 2246 articles published between the years 2005 and 2008 by the eight journals analyzed, 152 were about drug dependency. This value represents 6.77% of the total of the documents published. Of these 152 articles, 133 came from psychiatry journals and 19 came from clinical psychology journals. These findings imply that, out of the total of the articles published, 5.92% correspond to articles on drug dependency in the psychiatry journals and 0.85% in the clinical psychology journals. Among the clinical psychology journals, it is observed that the International Journal of Clinical and Health Psychology has published the most articles on drug dependency, with 8%. With regards to the psychiatry journals, the most articles related to drug dependency were found in the Revista de Psiquiatria Clinica, with 21.65%. The methodology most used in the total 152 articles was ex post facto (34.21%), followed by theoretical studies (30.26%), and surveys with probabilistic samples (12.50%). In turn, in the field of psychiatry and in clinical psychology, the methodology used most was ex post facto studies. The type of sample used most in all of the articles was formed by people who consumed some kind of drug (including alcohol and tobacco) (32.24%), followed by studies without samples (such as theoretical revisions) (26.32%). Generally, alcohol was the drug most studied (33.08%), followed by tobacco (15.04%), and cocaine (9.02%). It is necessary to emphasize that 38.16% of these studies did not concentrate on a single type of substance/drug; on the contrary, they analyzed general drug dependency. The central topics of these articles related drug dependency to treatment, comorbid psychopathology, epidemiology, associated beliefs and attitudes, neurological risks of drug consumption, delinquency, gender differences, and psychological variables of personality. Discussion The results obtained indicate a disconnection between the amount of Latin American scientific research on drug dependency in the fields of psychiatry and clinical psychology and the relevance of drug addictions in the present public health context. Only seven out of every 100 articles published and indexed in Spanish and Latin American journals in the JCR are dedicated to the study of drug dependency. In this case, basic and applied investigation in psychiatry and clinical psychology does not correspond to the social, public health, and educational needs of the population with respect to drug dependency. Consequently, political action would be weakly based on scientific models of prevention and intervention, thus explaining why its expected effectiveness and efficiency would be very low. When the two areas of knowledge are examined separately, the numbers vary slightly. In the clinical psychology journals, one out of every 100 articles focus on drug dependency. In the psychiatry journals, five out of every 100 documents refer to drug dependence. With respect to methodology, ex post facto has been used the most. The greatest contribution of this type of study comes from clinical psychology journals. Meanwhile, the psychiatry journals have contributed more towards studies of theoretical character. The most common type of sample in these publications is constituted by consumers of some type of substance. The low percentage of studies carried out with a risk population (adolescents) in the psychiatry journals in comparison to that percentage in the clinical psychology journals should be noted. The most studied aspect of drug dependency was treatment. Given the high level of national investment of resources in the prevention and treatment of addiction, the verification of therapy effectiveness should be a high-priority subject of investigation. It should be brought to attention that there are not studies that evaluate the effectiveness of prevention strategies for drug dependency. Most articles discuss drugs in general or refers to several substances. When the study concerns a particular drug, alcohol has been investigated the most. Although alcohol is a more socially acceptable and easily accessible drug, it can be very detrimental for consumers. In conclusion, the present bibliographical study demonstrates that the publication of scientific articles regarding drug dependency in Spanish and Latin American journals of psychiatry and clinical psychology is relatively low in relation to the social, public health, and political repercussions of the topic. The results call attention to the high degree of theorizing in psychiatric investigation and, to a lesser extent, in psychological research, in which empirical studies were represented by a majority of ex post facto studies. Alcohol is the drug most studied; and although it can have very negative consequences, these effects are usually ignored. The most investigated topic is the treatment of addiction, but investigators have ignored the development and evaluation of preventive strategies."
"This year's panel discussion, moderated by Beverly Dowdy, offered three perspectives on the current and future trends in open access (OA) from David Crotty, a senior editor from a prominent university publisher; Beth Bernhardt, an assistant dean for collection development and scholarly communications at an academic library; and Dr. Paige Hall Smith, an associate professor at a large state university. Each discussed different opportunities and challenges that open access presents. A question-and-answer period followed, prompting further discussion of the points brought up during the presentations, as well as related issues."
"Background: HINARI is one of the four programmes of Research4Life managed by the World Health Organization in partnership with Yale University Library. HINARI provides online access to the world's health-related scientific literature free or at very low cost to researchers in developing countries. The research examined the use of HINARI through a 5-year (2007-2011) citation analysis of Nigerian Journal of Clinical Practice. Method: The study was a citation analysis of 5 years of published volumes of Nigerian Journal of Clinical Practice. The analysis was carried out using issues ranging from volume 10 (2007) to 14 (2011). The use of HINARI was determined by comparing the total journal titles and articles cited from HINARI with non-HINARI journals in the five volumes of Nigerian Journal of Clinical Practice (NJCP). Results: Results show that only 42.8% of the journal titles cited are available in HINARI. On the contrary, in terms of total articles cited from the journals, HINARI had a higher citation of 56.1% with a greater citation frequency of individual titles. Conclusion: The higher article citations and repeated use of individual titles available in HINARI suggest that health researchers in Nigeria are using the HINARI resource to a measurable extent."
"Scientists and managers using citation-based indicators to help evaluate research cannot evaluate recent articles because of the time needed for citations to accrue. Reading occurs before citing, however, and so it makes sense to count readers rather than citations for recent publications. To assess this, Mendeley readers and citations were obtained for articles from 2004 to late 2014 in five broad categories (agriculture, business, decision science, pharmacy, and the social sciences) and 50 subcategories. In these areas, citation counts tended to increase with every extra year since publication, and readership counts tended to increase faster initially but then stabilize after about 5 years. The correlation between citations and readers was also higher for longer time periods, stabilizing after about 5 years. Although there were substantial differences between broad fields and smaller differences between subfields, the results confirm the value of Mendeley reader counts as early scientific impact indicators."
"The history of Zoological Journal makes it possible to trace the entire century of the development of zoology in Russia and its changes at different developmental stages. Three principal stages in the history of the Journal are recognized, namely: 1. Beginning. Russian Zoological Journal (Revue Zoologique Russe) issued by the Zoological Department of the Society of Amateurs of Natural History Anthropology, and Ethnography, 1916 to 1923; 2. The first stabilization: Russian Zoological Journal, 1924 to 1930; 3. Quantitative growth: Zoological Journal, 1932 to 1936; 4. A crisis under extraordinary circumstances: 1937 to 1945; 5. The second stabilization: 1945 to 1965; 6. Stagnation: 1966 to 1990; 7. Degradation: 1990 to 1998; 8. The third stabilization: new ""poverty"", 1999 to 2015. Changes in the scientific policy, the contents of the Journal and its printing design are considered at these stages."
"Objective: To examine whether there is an association between scholarly impact, as measured by the h-index, academic rank, and National Institutes of Health (NIH) awards in academic ophthalmology. Design: Retrospective analysis of NIH RePORTER and Scopus databases. Participants: Not applicable. Methods: Five hundred seventy-three NIH awards to 391 primary investigators (PIs) in ophthalmology departments were examined. Grant recipients were organized by academic rank, obtained from online listings, and h-index, calculated using the Scopus database. NoneNIH-funded faculty from 20 randomly chosen academic ophthalmology departments also were organized by rank and h-index for comparison with their NIHfunded colleagues. Main Outcome Measures: Scholarly impact, as measured by the h-index, and NIH funding. Results: The h-index increased with successive academic rank among noneNIH-funded and NIH-funded faculty, as did NIH funding among the latter group. The NIH-funded faculty had higher scholarly impact, as measured by the h-index, than their noneNIH-funded PIs (h 18.3 vs. 7.8; P< 0.0001), even when considering publications only in the prior 5 years; h-index increased with increasing NIH funding ranges. The h-indices of those holding an MD degree (21.4 +/- 1.6 standard error of mean) were not statistically higher than those of PhD holders (17.9 +/- 0.6) and those with both an MD and PhD degree (18.1 +/- 1.7; P 0.14). Conclusions: The h-index increases with increasing academic rank among NIH-funded and noneNIHfunded faculty in ophthalmology departments. This bibliometric is associated strongly with NIH funding because NIH-funded PIs had higher scholarly impact than their noneNIH-funded colleagues, and increasing impact was noted with higher funding. The h-index is an objective and easily calculable measure that may be valuable as an adjunct in assessing research productivity, a significant factor for academic promotion in academic ophthalmology.

"Background: In clinical research scientific, legal as well as ethical aspects are important. It is well known that clinical investigators at university hospitals have to undertake their PhD-studies alongside their daily work and reconciling work and study can be challenging. The aim of this project was to create a web based course in clinical research bioethics (5 credits) and to examine whether the method is suitable for teaching bioethics. The course comprised of six modules: an initial examination (to assess knowledge in bioethics), information on research legislation, obtaining permissions from authorities, writing an essay on research ethics, preparing one's own study protocol, and a final exam. All assignments were designed with an idea of supporting students to reflect on their learning with their own research. Methods: 57 PhD-students (medical, nursing and dental sciences) enrolled and 46 completed the course. Course evaluation was done using a questionnaire. The response rate was 78%. Data were analyzed using quantitative methods and qualitative content analysis. Results: The course was viewed as useful and technically easy to perform. Students were pleased with the guidance offered. Personal feedback from teachers about students' own performance was seen advantageous and helped them to appreciate how these aspects could be applied their own studies. The course was also considered valuable for future research projects. Conclusions: Ethical issues and legislation of clinical research can be understood more easily when students can reflect the principles upon their own research project. Web based teaching environment is a feasible learning method for clinical investigators."
"This paper proposes an alternative metric to assess the relative influence journals have on research by using an influence ratio measure. Hospitality and tourism journals are used as a case study. Influence ratio enables a suite of journals to be evaluated through the calculation of a score for each journal that reflects the share of citations and the share of papers it produces against all citations and all papers in the set. A higher influence ratio score signifies that a journal is proportionately more influential, for it generates a greater share of citations than the share of papers published would suggest. The study evaluated three sets of hospitality and tourism journals (17 hospitality, 41 tourism and a combined set of 54 hospitality and tourism journals). The study illustrates the efficacy of using the influence ratio metric. A small number of journals in each field play a disproportionately strong influence in informing scholarship, with a long tail of relatively less influential journals observed. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

"We discuss each of the recommendations made by Hochberg et al. (Ecol Lett 12:2-4, 2009) to prevent the ""tragedy of the reviewer commons"". Having scientific journals share a common database of reviewers would be to recreate a bureaucratic organization, where extra-scientific considerations prevailed. Pre-reviewing of papers by colleagues is a widespread practice but raises problems of coordination. Revising manuscripts in line with all reviewers' recommendations presupposes that recommendations converge, which is acrobatic. Signing an undertaking that authors have taken into accounts all reviewers' comments is both authoritarian and sterilizing. Sending previous comments with subsequent submissions to other journals amounts to creating a cartel and a single all-encompassing journal, which again is sterilizing. Using young scientists as reviewers is highly risky: they might prove very severe; and if they are not yet published authors themselves, the recommendation violates the principle of peer review. Asking reviewers to be more severe would only create a crisis in the publishing houses and actually increase reviewers' workloads. The criticisms of the behavior of authors looking to publish in the best journals are unfair: it is natural for scholars to try to publish in the best journals and not to resign themselves to being second rate. Punishing lazy reviewers would only lower the quality of reports: instead, we favor the idea of paying reviewers ""in kind"" with, say, complimentary books or papers."
"Purpose: We aimed to assess the impact of open access (OA) versus paywalled access (PA) publication on Altmetric Attention Scores (AAS) and whether AAS correlates with future citation count access in the context of intensive care medicine (ICM) and anesthesia. Methods: 1854 and 2935 publications, in the year 2015, were identified in ICM and anesthesia respectively, using a Pubmed search. The mean AAS was measured for each article. Results: More ICM articles were OA, compared to of anesthesia articles (38.9% v 35.0% p=0.02). The mean AAS for OA ICM publications was significantly higher than that of PA ICM publications (17.34 vs 8.45, p < 0.01), however, this was not observed when examined in a fixed follow up time frame. AAS appear to correlate with future citation counts. Conclusions: ICM publications that are available as OA in the medium term result in higher AAS when compared to PA publications, this phenomenon was not observed in anesthesia. AAS correlate with future citation counts, however, a larger study is required to confirm this. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved."
"Background and Purpose: The purpose of this research was to establish the characteristics and the trends of scientific activity in the field of biology in Croatia, using scientometric analysis of scientific papers published in biology journals indexed in WoS-SCI Expanded database for the period of 1991 to 2005. The results could serve as useful tool in defining a more acceptable model for the evaluation and stimulation of scientific work, as well as in highlighting possible directions for the development of biological sciences in Croatia. Materials and Methods: The research sample consisted of 2,099 scientific papers which had a Croatian address, published in 342 biology journals indexed in WoS-SCI Expanded database from 1991 to 2005. The characteristics of scientific productivity and scientific impact, measured using citation analysis, were analysed in the field of biology as a whole, as well as in the various biological disciplines. The journal's status was determined using its IF from the JCR Science Edition database for 2005. As additional indicators, trends in co-authorship as well as international cooperation were determined. Results and Conclusions: The evaluation of scientific work in the field of biology should be adapted to the specificities of scientific publishing in various biological disciplines. The number of papers in different disciplines varied considerably, as well as the average number of citation per paper and the average number of authors per paper In the field of biology as a whole, on average 7.3 citations per paper and 4.1 authors per paper were observed. The majority of papers (90%) were co-authored publications. 32.2% of published papers were co-authored with a foreign institution. 7.7% of papers were published in the most prestigious journals by IF (the ""top 10%"" journals). Those papers published in the ""top 10%"" journals which were co-authored with a foreign institution obtained the highest impact (16.8 citations per paper)."
"Scholars have often relied on name initials to resolve name ambiguities in large-scale coauthorship network research. This approach bears the risk of incorrectly merging or splitting author identities. The use of initial-based disambiguation has been justified by the assumption that such errors would not affect research findings too much. This paper tests that assumption by analyzing coauthorship networks from five academic fields-biology, computer science, nanoscience, neuroscience, and physics-and an interdisciplinary journal, PNAS. Name instances in data sets of this study were disambiguated based on heuristics gained from previous algorithmic disambiguation solutions. We use disambiguated data as a proxy of ground-truth to test the performance of three types of initial-based disambiguation. Our results show that initial-based disambiguation can misrepresent statistical properties of coauthorship networks: It deflates the number of unique authors, number of components, average shortest paths, clustering coefficient, and assortativity, while it inflates average productivity, density, average coauthor number per author, and largest component size. Also, on average, more than half of top 10 productive or collaborative authors drop off the lists. Asian names were found to account for the majority of misidentification by initial-based disambiguation due to their common surname and given name initials."
The article attempts to assess the results of the independent development of the CIS countries in the field of science over the period 1990-2009. The analysis of the numerous scientometric indicators reveals the decrease of the number of expert researchers and the significant decrease in the scientific and technical output. The article also provides the information about the dynamics of a set of indicators which allows to draw conclusions about the effectiveness of the research activity in the CIS countries.
"In this study, we explore the citedness of research data, its distribution over time and its relation to the availability of a digital object identifier (DOI) in the Thomson Reuters database Data Citation Index (DCI). We investigate if cited research data ""impacts'' the (social) web, reflected by altmetrics scores, and if there is any relationship between the number of citations and the sum of altmetrics scores from various social media platforms. Three tools are used to collect altmetrics scores, namely PlumX, ImpactStory, and Altmetric.com, and the corresponding results are compared. We found that out of the three altmetrics tools, PlumX has the best coverage. Our experiments revealed that research data remain mostly uncited (about 85 %), although there has been an increase in citing data sets published since 2008. The percentage of the number of cited research data with a DOI in DCI has decreased in the last years. Only nine repositories are responsible for research data with DOIs and two or more citations. The number of cited research data with altmetrics ""foot-prints'' is even lower (4-9 %) but shows a higher coverage of research data from the last decade. In our study, we also found no correlation between the number of citations and the total number of altmetrics scores. Yet, certain data types (i.e. survey, aggregate data, and sequence data) are more often cited and also receive higher altmetrics scores. Additionally, we performed citation and altmetric analyses of all research data published between 2011 and 2013 in four different disciplines covered by the DCI. In general, these results correspond very well with the ones obtained for research data cited at least twice and also show low numbers in citations and in altmetrics. Finally, we observed that there are disciplinary differences in the availability and extent of altmetrics scores."
"This article describes the implementation of an institutional portal of academic journals. Presents a checklist for migration to scientific journals publishing platform, the Electronic System for Journal Publishing - Open Journal Systems. Discuss the importance of the extension projects and their integration with research projects and training of students, librarians, editors and professors. Concludes by highlighting the importance of digital journals and their standardization and systematization in portals, as well as demonstrating the need for multidisciplinary team work and the migration process and the structure involved."
"Scientific communication, career advancement, and funding decisions are all dependent on research publications. The way manuscripts are handled by high-visibility, professionally edited magazines differs from the way academic journals evaluate manuscripts, using active scientists as monitoring editors. In this essay, I discuss the benefits that come with the involvement of active scientists. I enumerate the decisions a monitoring editor has to make, and how he or she goes about making them. Finally, I indicate ways in which authors can help to make the process a smoother and more positive experience."
"There are two versions in the literature of counting co-author pairs. Whereas the first version leads to a two-dimensional (2-D) power function distribution; the other version shows three-dimensional (3-D) graphs, totally rotatable around and their shapes are visible in space from all possible points of view. As a result, these new 3-D computer graphs, called ""Social Gestalts"" deliver more comprehensive information about social network structures than simple 2-D power function distributions. The mathematical model of Social Gestalts and the corresponding methods for the 3-D visualization and animation of collaboration networks are presented in Part I of this paper. Fundamental findings in psychology/sociology and physics are used as a basis for the development of this model. The application of these new methods to male and to female networks is shown in Part II. After regression analysis the visualized Social Gestalts are rather identical with the corresponding empirical distributions (R-2 >0.99). The structures of female co-authorship networks differ markedly from the structures of the male co-authorship networks. For female co-author pairs' networks, accentuation of productivity dissimilarities of the pairs is becoming visible but on the contrary, for male co-author pairs' networks, accentuation of productivity similarities of the pairs is expressed.

"Data visualization is a very important aspect of data analysis and of presentation. Focusing on the latter, this paper discusses various elements of constructing graphs for publications. Bad and good graphs are compared, and a checklist with graphical elements to be used while creating graphs is proposed."
"Countries, research institutions, and scholars are interested in identifying and promoting high-impact and transformative scientific research. This paper presents a novel set of text-and citation-based metrics that can be used to identify high-impact and transformative works. The 11 metrics can be grouped into seven types: Radical-Generative, Radical-Destructive, Risky, Multidisciplinary, Wide Impact, Growing Impact, and Impact (overall). The metrics are exemplified, validated, and compared using a set of 10,778,696 MEDLINE articles matched to the Science Citation Index Expanded (TM). Articles are grouped into six 5-year periods (spanning 1983-2012) using publication year and into 6,159 fields constructed using comparable MeSH terms, with which each article is tagged. The analysis is conducted at the level of a field-period pair, of which 15,051 have articles and are used in this study. A factor analysis shows that transformativeness and impact are positively related (rho = .402), but represent distinct phenomena. Looking at the subcomponents of transformativeness, there is no evidence that transformative work is adopted slowly or that the generation of important new concepts coincides with the obsolescence of existing concepts. We also find that the generation of important new concepts and highly cited work is more risky. Finally, supporting the validity of our metrics, we show that work that draws on a wider range of research fields is used more widely."
"We assessed 6122 environmental modelling papers published since 2005 to determine whether the number of citations each paper had received by September 2014 could be predicted with no knowledge of the paper's quality. A random forest was applied, using a range of easily quantified or classified variables as predictors. The 511 papers published in two key journals in 2008 were further analysed to consider additional variables. Papers with no differential equations received more citations. The topic of the paper, number of authors and publication venue were also significant. Ten other factors, some of which have been found significant in other studies, were also considered, but most added little to the predictive power of the models. Collectively, all factors predicted 16-29% of the variation in citation counts, with the remaining variance (the majority) presumably attributable to important subjective factors such as paper quality, clarity and timeliness.

"The scientific production in E-learning has an average annual growth rate of 16%, which along with the 3.9% annual increase in the number of virtual students worldwide present a very favorable prospect for the category. However, the growth in scientific production is not constant. The objective of this work was to analyze the behavior of scientific production in E-learning from a bibliometric perspective in the 2003-2015 period, to identify its evolution in relation to other areas of knowledge. The methodology used compared production in E-learning versus world production, production by regions and blocks of countries and production of related areas of knowledge. With these results, a visualization was generated in VOSViewer under the overlay mapping technique to identify the dynamics of the 81 existing scientific journals in the category. This analysis determined that the growth in production in E-learning is due to the contribution of the journals in Social Sciences and that the decrease during the years 2013-2015 is mainly due to the fact that Computer Science have decreased their contribution in conference papers and reviews. In conclusion, E-learning is on the decline, since the growth offered by the Social Sciences is not enough to counteract the decline in the contribution of Computer Science. The method used in this study is a contribution to bibliometric techniques to explain the behavior of scientific production in a certain area of knowledge."
"We present a bibliometric study of research articles on mathematics education, as well as an analyst's of networks of collaboration in the same, based on a sample of Spanish journals published during the period 1999-2008. For this purpose we analyzed 774 articles published in the eight most representative Spanish journals in the field. The results show compliance with scientometric laws and patterns, as well as verifying the low level of scientific collaboration among researchers in the area, as well as among institutions."
"Increasing pressure on budgets of funding bodies has led to discussion of how to make financial resources go further, and to the concern that some researchers take more money from funding bodies for a particular project than needed, a practice that has been termed ""double-dipping"". Some evidence has emerged that this might be occurring, and in this context of suddenly increased funding scarcity, albeit in a system with greater forms of support, a proposal has been made that funding bodies monitor and manage individual researcher portfolios to optimize resource use. Our paper provides evidence relevant to both the ""double dipping"" issue and the proposal to manage portfolios. We show that where certain pre-conditions for ""double dipping"" are met (i.e. when funding comes from more than organisation, and the organisations fund research in a very similar area), and where therefore an argument to monitor researcher portfolios might be applicable, the research produced under these conditions has greater citation impact. We query the claim that when more funding is acknowledged this is inherently undesirable and we express our doubts that subjecting the allocation of funding to researchers to a bureaucratic management process will necessarily increase the impact of research."
"Titles are the first point of contact between authors and readers. They call for attention and provide concise and exhaustive information on the research. State of the art in the medical field shows that titles have a mean word count ranging from 15.48 to 15.85 and that they can be arranged into four different formats: nominal, full-sentence, compound and question. Veterinary Medicine has not been object of study and is an underrepresented field in genre analytical surveys. This research wants to fill in part this gap by discussing a pilot survey on veterinary research article titles. To this aim, six issues from three veterinary journals were scanned and the samples labelled ""original research article"" were examined. The corpus, consisting of 74 specimens, was analysed to elicit the mean word count and the format. Results reveal a mean length of 14.06 words per title and the prevalence of nominal and compound titles. These data are shared to offer a preliminary framework that can serve to inform on the practices adopted by veterinary researchers to communicate findings."
"Along with the rapid growth of editorial systems and publishers, the number of research articles is increasing, which creates a need for an effective dissemination strategy. Researchers commonly use editorial systems in a candid manner. However, when researchers concurrently submit the same contribution in more than one editorial system, it is considered unethical. In this paper, we propose a novel approach called DeMSum for detecting such duplicate submissions. DeMSum verifies a manuscript (MS) by processing the MS attributes that are accessed through the editorial system. To the best of our knowledge, DeMSum is the first system to address the double submission issue, thus enabling the use of diverse editorial systems for MS review. We implemented a prototype, and our evaluation of the prototype produced excellent results."
"U.S. tenure-track positions have steadily declined over the past 30 years and emphasis on research productivity has escalated. To achieve higher research and scholarship goals, the literature revealed that African American scholars have additional issues to overcome beyond the usual hurdles and challenges confronting other faculty. This study explored current research productivity by examining citation impact scores (h-indices) collected from Publish or Perish of African American scholars in top 25 ranked schools of social work cited in the 2012 U.S. News and World Report. The resultant sample consisted of N = 14 scholars with h-index scores of 9 and higher. Results revealed nonsignificant statistical differences between specified subgroupings, and 80% of these scholars overexceeded their respective school mean h-index scores. Future research calls for a more comprehensive knowledge of faculty research and scholarship activities overall, including unique subgroups of Social Work scholars such as African Americans."
"The set of citations received by a set of publications consists of citations received by articles in the h-core and citations received by articles in the h-tail. Denoting the cardinalities of these fours sets as C, P, C (H) and C (T) we introduce the tail-core ratio (C (T)/C (H)) and show that in practical cases this ratio tends to increase. Introducing further the k-index, defined as k = (C/P)/(C (T)/C (H)), we show that this index decreases in most practical cases. A power law model is in accordance with these practical observations."
"We develop a novel framework to evaluate the quality of academic finance conferences. In particular, we analyze the publication and citation outcomes of 18,535 conference papers presented at 15 academic finance conferences between 2007 and 2012. In addition, we provide evidence of the perceived quality of these academic finance conferences by surveying a large number of participants of the 15 conferences. The use of three different quality proxies enables us to contrast levels of conference quality based on the quality of presented papers to levels of conference quality perceived by conference participants. Our results reveal two quality clusters of academic finance conferences and show that the use of the three quality dimensions, while generally robust, is associated with a number of peculiarities.

"Measuring scientific performance is currently a common practice of funding agencies, fellowship evaluations and hiring institutions. However, as has already been recognized by many authors, comparing the performance in different scientific fields is a difficult task due to the different publication and citation patterns observed in each field. In this article, we defend that scientific performance of an individual scientist, laboratory or institution should be analysed within the corresponding context and we provide objective tools to perform this kind of comparative analysis. The usage of the new tools is illustrated by using two control groups, to which several performance measurements are referred: one group being the Physics and Chemistry Nobel laureates from 2007 to 2012, the other group consisting of a list of outstanding scientists affiliated to two different institutions."
"Citation analysis has been widely used to evaluate the impact of articles in medical and surgical specialties. Although China is the most populous country in the world, and although more than 50,000 orthopaedic surgeons practice there, to our knowledge no formal citation analysis of Chinese orthopaedic articles has been performed. We identified the 50 most-cited orthopaedic articles from mainland China and evaluated these articles in terms of their language of publication, source journals, and topics. Science Citation Index Expanded was searched in July 31, 2014 for citations of articles published in 70 selected journals since the inception of the database. The 50 most-cited orthopaedic articles originating in mainland China were identified. Basic information, including title, authors, year of publication, article type, journal in which the work was published, city, institution, number of citations, decade published, and topic or subspecialty of the research were recorded. The number of citations for the top 50 papers ranged from 181 to 31 (mean, 52). These articles were published between 1981 and 2010. The decade of 2000 to 2009 was the most prolific, with 36 of the top 50 articles published during this time. All articles were written in English and they were published in a total of 16 journals. The journal Spine published the largest number of articles (12), followed by Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (A (R)) (seven). The journal Lancet had the highest impact factor (39.207 for 2013) among any of the journals that published articles we identified. The top 50 articles originated mainly from Beijing (16) and Shanghai (12), with basic research being the focus of the majority (27 of 50; 54%); the remaining were clinical studies. Bone was the most-investigated topic in basic research; the spine was the most-common topic among the identified clinical studies. The 50 most-cited articles that we identified should be considered influential, although a large gap remains between mainland China and the global orthopaedic community in terms of citations per article. Nevertheless, insofar as the most-recent decade of our survey generated the most articles in this top-50 list, we would characterize mainland China's effect on musculoskeletal research as increasing, and as funding increases to programs in mainland China, we anticipate this trend will continue in the future."
"Objective: To estimate the time spent by the researchers for preparing grant proposals, and to examine whether spending more time increase the chances of success. Design: Observational study. Setting: The National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) of Australia. Participants: Researchers who submitted one or more NHMRC Project Grant proposals in March 2012. Main outcome measures: Total researcher time spent preparing proposals; funding success as predicted by the time spent. Results: The NHMRC received 3727 proposals of which 3570 were reviewed and 731 (21%) were funded. Among our 285 participants who submitted 632 proposals, 21% were successful. Preparing a new proposal took an average of 38 working days of researcher time and a resubmitted proposal took 28 working days, an overall average of 34 days per proposal. An estimated 550 working years of researchers' time (95% CI 513 to 589) was spent preparing the 3727 proposals, which translates into annual salary costs of AU$66 million. More time spent preparing a proposal did not increase the chances of success for the lead researcher (prevalence ratio (PR) of success for 10 day increase=0.91, 95% credible interval 0.78 to 1.04) or other researchers (PR=0.89, 95% CI 0.67 to 1.17). Conclusions: Considerable time is spent preparing NHMRC Project Grant proposals. As success rates are historically 20-25%, much of this time has no immediate benefit to either the researcher or society, and there are large opportunity costs in lost research output. The application process could be shortened so that only information relevant for peer review, not administration, is collected. This would have little impact on the quality of peer review and the time saved could be reinvested into research."
"Authorship and authorship abuse are in the focus of interest of all main actors in the publication game authors, reviewers and editors of scientific journals. Along with the steady rise of the number of publications, the number of coauthors in multiauthored papers raises even more, some of them being undeserved authors. Because publication is the main way for evaluating scientists, authorship is. prone to abuse, and thus the false/undeserved/gift authorship emerges. This dilutes the responsibility and damages the publication enterprise, thus initiating a constant struggle of scientific community against this type of scientific dishonesty. In this paper, several prevention and corrective measures with the aim to diminish such a dishonest behavior of authors are described."
"Various stakeholders use the ranking of Higher Education Institutions (HEIs) as a measure of quality. This is evident from numerous ranking efforts - both of the government (National Institutional Ranking Framework (NIRF) of the Ministry of Human Resources Development (MHRD), the National Academic Accreditation Council (NAAC) and the National Board of Accreditation (NBA)) and the private sector. Developing countries like India should assess the academic quality by working with parameters that are globally acceptable, transparent to all stakeholders and not amenable to the control of lobby groups. One such parameter is publications in reputed international journals indexed by databases like Scopus and Web of Science is also considered by the NIRF. However, in contrary to the NIRF method, we propose that instead of considering the total publications the computations should be based on the publication rate (number of publications per teacher) to control the faculty size bias. Besides using the NIRF 2017 data, we observed that higher density of Ph D students increases both the number and the quality of publications and HEIs that invest more, tends to have a higher publication rate. Therefore, we conclude that the Indian HEIs should increase the number of Ph D students and access better funding in order to improve their global presence."
"This study presents a scientometric analysis of 253 articles published in Sadhana during the year 2005-2009. Five volumes of the journal are taken up to observe the distribution of contribution, authorship pattern, institution-wise distribution, geographical distribution of contribution, average length of paper, tables and illustrations used and citation pattern in each volume. Results indicate that highest number of papers have been written by two authors. The contributions received in this journal are more from India than from the other countries. Foreign documents show their more representation in references cited. Journals are referred more frequently than other documents.The average number of references per article is 23.72 and 200.602 per volume."
"International Ocean Discovery Program (IODP 2013-2023) and its predecessors is the largest and longest international cooperation research program in earth science. It requires a strong financial support from government. Therefore, a study to compare research achievements among main IODP members was carried out. All peer-reviewed publications related with IODP can be acquired through database built by American geosciences institute. Comparisons of research directions and focus among the United States, Japan, Germany and P. R. China were studied using term frequency-inverse document frequency matrix, co-word, co-citation cluster and overlay analysis methods. Publication numbers, collaboration network, annual variation and expedition achievements among IODP main members were analyzed at the meantime. Research output differences in ocean science among IODP main members were also covered and compared with IODP outputs.US has emerged as absolutely the leader of IODP. Japan, Germany, UK and France are close followers, and these countries also have their own research topics. P. R. China ranks six with publication number and ranks ten with first authors and corresponding authors. There is a large gap between P. R. China and other countries such as US and Japan, which lies in expedition chief scientists' percentage, basic researches and activeness in research focus. Besides, researches output performance of P. R. China in ocean science is better it ranks 2 in ocean science publications. What is more, Japan has a trend to catch US, however, P. R. China doesn't have any sign of increasing. Sustained fiscal effort is still necessary for P. R. China."
"This study investigates the prevalence and characteristics of papers published in popular predatory journals by South African academics in economic and management sciences. Our aim is to raise awareness and to deepen understanding of the predatory publishing phenomenon. We collected 728 recent (2013 to mid-2016) articles with South African authors in five popular in the field journals classified as 'potential, possible, or probable predatory' according to Beall's list. Our data shows that publishing in these predatory journals is widespread across authors and universities. However, the data also shows that most of the authors only published once in these journals, suggesting that they perhaps mistakenly perceived the journals as being legitimate research outlets. We found evidence of low-quality publishing by the journals in our data, consistent with deficient peer review and copy editing processes. Thus, low-quality publishing was evident from spelling and grammar mistakes in the titles of articles, publishing the same paper twice in the same journal, so-called 'salami slicing', and the publishing of an article already published in another journal. If a large number of South African academics publish papers in predatory journals, then those journals become legitimised locally, leading to other South African academics also publishing in them. This can create a dangerous downward spiral in research quality."
"We collected the impact factor (IF) and 5-year impact factor (5-IF) of 1058 medical journals in SCI-expanded database, and explore their changes with the increase of publication frequency (PF). Our studies shows that there are positive correlation of PF with IF (r=0.313, P=0.000) and 5-IF (r=0.298, P=0.000). According to the levels of journals' PF, the journals were divided into four groups. The journals with PF from 1 to 5 were divided into group I, t hat from 6 to 11, 12 to 23, 24 to 58 were divided into group II, group III and group IV, respectively. The IF of the journals in group I were 1.94 +/- 1.71, 2.16 +/- 4.30 in group II, 3.17 +/- 2.93 in group III, and 8.00 +/- 9.68 in group IV, respectively. The 5-IF of the journals in group I were 2.080 +/- 1.668, 2.194 +/- 3.046 in group II, 3.253 +/- 3.045 in group III, and 8.00 +/- 10.015 in group IV, respectively. With comparison of mean ranks of IF and 5-IF among four groups with different PF, we had found that the higher the PF the higher the IF (H=114.075, P=0.000) and 5-IF (H=102.796, P=0.000). From 2006 to 2008, PF increased at various degrees in 22 journals, of which the total citation increased too, and just 18 journals of which IF increased. After PF increased in 22 journals, IF and 5-year IF were obviously higher than those before PF increased (Z=2.386, P=0.017; Z=4.015, P=0.000). We concluded that the IF and 5-IF are increased with the increasing of journals' PF. The mechanism of the positive correlation between IF and PF are discussed."
"This article presents the research performance of the 39 central universities in India. The research publication data, indexed in the Web of Science, for the 39 central universities for a 25-year period (1990-2014) are used for analysis. The data are computationally analysed to identify productivity, productivity per capita, productivity per crore rupees grant, rate of growth of research output, authorship and collaboration pattern, citation impact and discipline-wise research strength of these institutions. Research performance of the central universities is measured and compared with two top-ranking world universities, namely University of Cambridge and Stanford University. While older well-established big universities such as University of Delhi and Banaras Hindu University perform better than newer universities, some relatively smaller universities, such as the university of Hyderabad have impressive research performance. What is disturbing is that combined research output of all central universities taken together is less than that of either of University of Cambridge or Stanford University alone. The results also provide discipline-wise research strengths of all the universities."
"Open access (OA) journals are a growing phenomenon largely of the past decade wherein readers can access the content of scientific journals without paying for a subscription. The costs are borne by authors (or their institutions) who pay a fee to be published, thus allowing readers to access, search, print, and cite the journals without cost. Although the OA model, in and of itself, need not diminish scientific rigor, selectivity, or peer review, the ""author pays"" model creates an inherent conflict of interest: it operates with the incentive on the part of the journal to publish more and reject less. This is coupled with cost containment measures that affect the journals' ability to engage experienced editors and professional staff to scrutinize data, data analyses, and author conflicts of interest. While some OA journals appear to be comparable to their print competitors, others are ""predatory"" and have no legitimacy at all. Two recent ""scams""- one recently published in Science-highlight the urgency of addressing the issues raised by OA publication so that OA does not lose its credibility just as it begins to gather substantial momentum. High-quality journals develop their reputations over time, and OA outlets will be no exception. For this to occur, however, the OA audience will need to be satisfied that OA can deliver high-quality publications utilizing rigorous peer review, editing, and conflict of interest scrutiny. Academic tenure and promotion committees that review scholarly credentials are understandably skeptical of publications in unrecognized journals, and the large number of new OA outlets contributes to this urgency from their perspective as well."
"The aim of this work is to analyze whether differences exist in the scientific research of the most productive professors in Spanish psychology based on their gender. For this purpose, we analyzed the production of a sample of the 610 most productive professors in the different areas of psychology in articles published in journals of the Journal Citation Reports, by citations of these articles and in doctoral dissertations directed. The results show that the production of males higher than is for women in the indicators analyzed, with variable differences based on psychology areas. The discussion examines the causes of these differences, focusing in the later entry of women to the Spanish university."
"In this paper I outline how author identifiers enable to track international mobility of scientists. Authorship systems help to distinguish among similar names and provide information on affiliations and thus countries of stay. This study explores the relation between CV data and Scopus data in regard to tracking international mobility of scientists. To test the consistency and applicability of data on mobility episodes, residence countries as provided in CVs of a set of German scientists were compared against country information in the affiliations of their publications. Therefore, the CVs of Leibniz laureates were coded for the period 1996-2015 and their publications were gathered on the basis of Scopus author ID. Results show that the majority of scientists under study have a single author ID (68.4%). However, there are laureates with so-called split identities' where more than one author ID exists. Most of them have a dominant author ID that covers the majority of their publications and one or more additional IDs with only a few publications causing these split identities. Recall statistic shows that the use of the dominant author ID of each laureate would result in around 97% of their publication output. In contrast, the precision of Scopus author ID proves to be high. A random sample shows that all publications assigned to a specific author ID relate to a single individual, so that the precision statistic would yield 100%. Further results show that the registry systems ORCID and ResearcherID are no alternatives to Scopus author ID, because a minority of laureates make use of these identifier systems and data is often incomplete. Unlike ORCID and ResearcherID that suffer from a selection bias as those scientists who remain in science maintain their author profiles, Scopus author ID exists for every author publishing in sources covered by Scopus. The comparison of mobility data in Scopus versus CV data shows that bibliometric data is suitable to identify a scientist's international mobility and appears to be a good solution if there are no CVs available or if they are incomplete. Furthermore, the reasons for inconsistencies in mobility data are discussed. These mainly reside in the lack of co-author affiliations, incomplete CV data, and other minor reasons."
"Admittedly, despite the plethora of scientometric indices proposed to rank scientists, none of them can fully capture the performance and impact of a scientist, since each index quantifies only one or a few aspects of his/her multifarious performance. Therefore, the task of scientometric ranking can be seen as a multi-dimensional ranking problem, where the different indices comprise the dimensions. The application of the skyline operator comes then as a natural solution to the problem. In this article we apply the skyline operator to scientist ranking to identify those scientists whose performance cannot be surpassed by others' with respect to all attributes. This technique can be used as a tool for short-listing distinguished researchers in case of award nomination. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."
"This paper analyses the scientific cooperation between German and Chinese institutions in the field of the life sciences on the basis of co-publications published between 2007 and 2011 in Web of Science covered sources. After analyzing the global output of publications in the life sciences, and identifying China's most important international partners on country level, this study focuses on a network and cluster analysis of German-Chinese co-publications on an institutional level. Cleaning and standardizing all German and Chinese addresses, a total of 531 German and 700 Chinese institutions were identified that co-published together in the period under analysis. Disaggregating the institutes of Chinese Academy of Sciences made it possible to obtain more meaningful information on existing co-publication structures. Using VOSviewer the German-Chinese collaboration network in the life sciences is visualized and clusters of similar institutions identified. The seven most important clusters of German-Chinese co-publications partners are briefly described providing background information for funding agencies such as the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research or researchers in the life sciences, who wish to establish collaborations with German or Chinese institutions."
"This paper examines country-specific factors that affect the three most influential world university rankings (the Academic Ranking of World Universities, the QS World University Ranking, and the Times Higher Education World University Ranking). We run a cross sectional regression that covers 42-71 countries (depending on the ranking and data availability). We show that the position of universities from a country in the ranking is determined by the following country-specific variables: economic potential of the country, research and development expenditure, long-term political stability (freedom from war, occupation, coups and major changes in the political system), and institutional variables, including government effectiveness."
"This study documented the trends in authorship and sampling in applied biomechanics research published in the Journal of Applied Biomechanics and ISBS Proceedings. Original research articles of the 1989, 1994, 1999, 2004, and 2009 volumes of these serials were reviewed, excluding reviews, modeling papers, technical notes, and editorials. Compared to 1989 volumes, the mean number of authors per paper significantly increased (35 and 100%, respectively) in the 2009 volumes, along with increased rates of hyperauthorship, and a decline in rates of single authorship. Sample sizes varied widely across papers and did not appear to change since 1989."
"We study the network effects of publishing in finance. Our regression results suggest that, among the top-3 journals (Journal of Finance (JF),Journal of Financial Economics (JFE), and Review of Financial Studies (RFS)) and control for other determinants of citations, published articles with coauthor network have significant lower total citation counts. In contrast, the published articles with colleague network, on average, show significant higher total citation counts. That is, editors favor their previous coauthors but they are able to identify good papers from their colleagues. For the other 20 finance journals, we do not find any network effects.

"A system of scholarly monograph publishing, primarily under the auspices of university presses, coalesced only 50 years ago as part of the final stage of the professionalization of US institutions of higher education. The resulting analogue publishing system supplied the authorized print monographs that academic institutions newly required for faculty tenure and promotion. That publishing system - as each of its components - was bounded, stable, identifiable, well ordered, and well policed. As successive financial shocks battered both the country in general and scholarly publishing in particular, just a decade after its final formation, the analogue system went into extended decline. Finally, it is now giving way to a digital scholarly publishing system whose configuration and components are still obscure and in flux, but whose epistemological bases differ from the analogue system in almost all important respects: it will be relatively unbounded and stochastic, composed of units that are inherently amorphous and shape shifting, and marked by contested authorization of diverse content. This digitally driven, epistemic system shift in scholarly publishing may well be an extended work in progress, since the doomed analogue system is still fiscally dominant with respect to monographs, and the nascent digital system has not yet coalesced around a multitude of emerging digital affordances."
"Young drivers continue to be over-represented in road crash fatalities despite a multitude of research, communication and intervention. Evidence-based improvement depends to a great extent upon research methodology quality and its reporting, with known limitations in the peer-review process. The aim of the current research was to review the scope of research methodologies applied in 'young driver' and 'teen driver' research and their reporting in four peer-review journals in the field between January 2006 and December 2013. In total, 806 articles were identified and assessed. Reporting omissions included participant gender (11% of papers), response rates (49%), retention rates (39%) and information regarding incentives (44%). Greater breadth and specific improvements in study designs and reporting are thereby identified as a means to further advance the field."
"Evaluative bibliometrics is concerned with comparing research units by using statistical procedures. According to Williams (2012) an empirical study should be concerned with the substantive and practical significance of the findings as well as the sign and statistical significance of effects. In this study we will explain what adjusted predictions and marginal effects are and how useful they are for institutional evaluative bibliometrics. As an illustration, we will calculate a regression model using publications (and citation data) produced by four universities in German-speaking countries from 1980 to 2010. We will show how these predictions and effects can be estimated and plotted, and how this makes it far easier to get a practical feel for the substantive meaning of results in evaluative bibliometric studies. An added benefit of this approach is that it makes it far easier to explain results obtained via sophisticated statistical techniques to a broader and sometimes non-technical audience. We will focus particularly on Average Adjusted Predictions (AAPs), Average Marginal Effects (AMEs), Adjusted Predictions at Representative Values (APRVs) and Marginal Effects at Representative Values (MERVs).

"Bibliometric studies, which involve the use of statistical methods, are increasingly being used for research assessment. A bibliometric analysis was conducted to evaluate the publication pattern of methaemoglobinaemia research output at the global level based on the Scopus database. We analysed selected documents with ""methemoglobinemia"", or ""methaemoglobinaemia"" as a part of the title and reported the following parameters: trends of publication output, country of publication, journal pattern, collaborative measures, citations pattern, and institute productivity. A total of 1770 articles were published worldwide. The time trend for the number of articles showed an increase after 2000. The highest number of articles related to methaemoglobinaemia was from the USA (24.8 %), followed distantly by the UK (4.5 %), India (3.7 %), and France (3.7 %). No data related to methaemoglobinaemia were published from 152 countries. The total number of citations at the date of data collection was 10,080, with an average of 5.7 citations per document. The USA and UK had the highest h-index of 31 and 14, respectively, and six countries had an h-index of 9-14. It is notable that Canada was ranked eighth in the number of publications but fourth in h-index and India was ranked third in the number of publications but eighth in h-index. Furthermore, Canada produced the most internationally collaborated papers out of the total number of publications for each country (16.1 %), followed by the UK (13.9 %). This bibliometric analysis provides data contributing to a better understanding of the methaemoglobinaemia research field. The number of publications on methaemoglobinaemia increased significantly after 2000. The USA was the most productive country as measured by total publications. The USA and UK achieved the highest h-index in the field of methaemoglobinaemia research, signifying a higher quality of research than other countries."
"In this paper we present and discuss the results of six enquiries into the first author's academic writing over the last 50 years. Our aim is to assess whether or not his academic writing style has changed with age, experience, and cognitive decline. The results of these studies suggest that the readability of textbook chapters written by Hartley has remained fairly stable for over 50 years, with the later chapters becoming easier to read. The format of the titles used for chapters and papers has also remained much the same, with an increase in the use of titles written in the form of questions. It also appears that the format of the chosen titles had no effect on citation rates, but that papers that obtained the highest citation rates were written with colleagues rather by Hartley alone. Finally it is observed that Hartley's publication rate has remained much the same for over 50 years but that this has been achieved at the expense of other academic activities."
"Introduction. We report an investigation on collaboration practices in research papers published in the most prestigious English-medium astrophysics journals. Method. We propose an evaluation method based on three numerical indicators to study and compare, in absolute terms, three different types of collaboration (international, national and local) and authors' mobility on the basis of co-authorship. Analysis. We analysed 300 randomly selected research papers in three different time periods and used the student's t-test to determine whether the paired two-sample differences observed were statistically significant or not. Results. International collaboration is more common than national and local collaboration. International, national and local authors' mobility and intra-national collaboration do not seriously affect the indicators of the principal levels of collaboration. International collaboration and authors' mobility are more relevant for authors publishing in European journals, whereas national and intra-national collaboration and national mobility are more important for authors publishing in US journals. Conclusions. We explain the observed differences and patterns in terms of the specific scope of each journal and the socio-economic and political situation in both geographic contexts (Europe and the USA). Our study provides a global picture of collaboration practices in astrophysics and its possible application to many other sciences and fields would undoubtedly help bring into focus the really big issues for overall research management and policy."
"This paper contains the first empirical applications of a novel methodology for comparing the citation distributions of research units working in the same homogeneous field. The paper considers a situation in which the world citation distribution in 22 scientific fields is partitioned into three geographical areas: the U. S., the European Union (EU), and the rest of the world (RW). Given a critical citation level (CCL), we suggest using two real valued indicators to describe the shape of each area's distribution: a high-and a low-impact measure defined over the set of articles with citations below or above the CCL. It is found that, when the CCL is fixed at the 80th percentile of the world citation distribution, the U. S. performs dramatically better than the EU and the RW according to both indicators in all scientific fields. This superiority generally increases as we move from the incidence to the intensity and the citation inequality aspects of the phenomena in question. Surprisingly, changes observed when the CCL is increased from the 80th to the 95th percentile are of a relatively small order of magnitude. Finally, it is found that international co-authorship increases the high-impact and reduces the low-impact level in the three geographical areas. This is especially the case for the EU and the RW when they cooperate with the U.S. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."
The h-index has been shown to have predictive power. Here I report results of an empirical study showing that the increase of the h-index with time often depends for a long time on citations to rather old publications. This inert behavior of the h-index means that it is difficult to use it as a measure for predicting future scientific output. (c) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.
"Nowadays the Impact Factor (IF) is used as a measure of the relevance or the quality of an institution, a research group or project, or a particular researcher's scientific production, regardless of the scientific field to which they belong. This paper shows a classification of the Spanish journals included in the Institute for Scientific Information (ISI) databases based on their relevance. To measure this relevance we propose the Renormalized Impact Factor (Fr) instead of the IF. The results show that 12.64% of Spanish journals included in the ISI may be considered relevant in their categories and that a high IF does not necessarily indicate a high relevance of the journal, so the IF perhaps is not an appropriate index to evaluate scientific activities belonging to different fields."
"De Marchi and Lorenzetti (Scientometrics 106(1):253-261, 2016) have recently argued that in fields where the journal impact factor (IF) is not calculated, such as in the humanities, it is key to find other indicators that would allow the relevant community to assess the quality of scholarly journals and the research outputs that are published in them. The authors' suggestion is that information concerning the journal's rejection rate and the number of subscriptions sold is important and should be used for such assessment. The question addressed by the authors is very important, yet their proposed solutions are problematic. Here I point to some of these problems and illustrate them by considering as a case in point the field of philosophy. Specifically, here I argue for four main claims. First, even assuming that IF provides a reliable indicator of the quality of journals for the assessment of research outputs, De Marchi and Lorenzetti have failed to validate their suggested indicators and proxies. Second, it has not been clarified why, in absence of IF, other journal-based metrics that are currently available should not be used. Third, the relationship between IF and rejection rate is more complex than the authors suggest. Fourth, accepting the number of sold subscriptions as a proxy would result in discrimination against open access journals. The upshot of my analysis is that the question of how to assess journals and research outputs in the humanities is still far from resolved."
"Peer review is an important element of scientific communication but deserves quantitative examination. We used data from the handling service manuscript Central for ten mid-tier ecology and evolution journals to test whether number of external reviews completed improved citation rates for all accepted manuscripts. Contrary to a previous study examining this issue using resubmission data as a proxy for reviews, we show that citation rates of manuscripts do not correlate with the number of individuals that provided reviews. Importantly, externally-reviewed papers do not outperform editor-only reviewed published papers in terms of visibility within a 5-year citation window. These findings suggest that in many instances editors can be all that is needed to review papers (or at least conduct the critical first review to assess general suitability) if the purpose of peer review is to primarily filter and that journals can consider reducing the number of referees associated with reviewing ecology and evolution papers."
"This study's purpose was to identify distinct publishing trajectories among 442 participants in three prominent mentored health services research career development programs (Veterans Affairs, National Institutes of Health, and Agency for Healthcare Research & Quality) in the 10 years after award receipt and to examine awardee characteristics associated with different trajectories. Curricula vitae (CVs) of researchers receiving awards between 1991 and 2010 were coded for publications, grants, and awardee characteristics. We found that awardees published at constant or increasing rates despite flat or decreasing rates of first-author publications. Senior-author publications rose concurrently with rates of overall publications. Higher overall publication trajectories were associated with receiving more grants, more citations as measured by the h-index, and more authors per article. Lower trajectory groups were older and had a greater proportion of female awardees. Career development awards supported researchers who generally published successfully, but trajectories varied across individual researchers. Researchers' collaborative efforts produced an increasing number of articles, whereas first author articles were written at a more consistent rate. Career development awards in health services research supported the careers of researchers who published at a high rate; future research should further examine reasons for variation in publishing among early career researchers."
"In this study we compare internationalization of academic journals in six fields of science. Internationalization was investigated through journals' concentration on publishing papers from particular countries, relationship between the geographical distributions of editors and authors, and relationship between language of publication and the geographical distribution of papers. Having analyzed more than 1,000 journals we can state that social sciences literature in the fields considered is still nationally and linguistically fragmented more than natural sciences literature, but in some cases the gap is not so big. One of the consequences concerning research output assessment is that usefulness of international databases having national disparity in coverage is still limited in social sciences."
"Background: Pediatric surgery is one of the most difficult surgical fellowships to obtain. It requires stellar academic credentials and, often, dedicated time pursuing research. It is unknown, however, if pediatric surgeons maintain high academic output as faculty members. We hypothesized that the majority of pediatric surgeons do not pursue robust research activities as faculty, and therefore, over time, their academic productivity decreases. Methods: Numbers of publications, citations, H-index, and NIH funding rates were determined for 4354 surgical faculty at the top-55 NIH based departments of surgery using websites, Scopus, NIH RePORTER, and Grantome. Continuous variables were compared with ANOVA and post-hoc Bonferroni; categorical variables by chi(2) test. p < 0.05 was significant. Results: In this dataset, 321 pediatric surgery (PS) faculty represented 7.4% of the cohort. Among PS faculty, 31% were assistant professors, 24% associate professors, 31% full professors and 13% had no academic rank. PS faculty had significantly more publications, a higher H index, and more high level NIH funding early in their careers at the assistant professor level compared to general surgeons. PS faculty at the associate professor level had equivalent high level NIH funding, but lower recentness and academic power compared to general surgeons. Professors of PS rebounded slightly, with only observed deficiencies in number of citations compared to general surgeons. Conclusions: PS faculty in assistant professor ranks has higher scholarly productivity compared to equivalently ranked general surgeons. Despite some mild academic setbacks in midcareer, pediatric surgeons are able to maintain similar academic productivity to their general surgery colleagues by the time they are full professors.

"Rationale and Objectives: The Hirsch Index (H index) is widely applied as a metric of scientific productivity. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the role of self-citation on the H index in academic radiology. Materials and Methods: Through the National Resident Matching Program's Web site, one third (47/139) of radiology residency programs were selected randomly. All chairpersons and full professors were included. Using the Scopus database, we calculated the H index as well as the number of cumulative citations with and without inclusion of self-citations. We determined the proportion of academic staff in which H index increased by one, two, or greater than two integers. We also correlated the proportional increase in H index before and after inclusion of self citations with the number of publications. Results: A total of 487 academic staff (47 chair and 440 professors) was identified. Because of self-citation, mean +/- SD of the H index increased from 13.7 +/- 9.9 to 14.0 +/- 10.2; mean SD of cumulative citations increased from 1804 +/- 1889 to 1870 +/- 1971. H index numbers did not change in 376/487 (77%) authors as a result of self-citation. There was no correlation between number of publications and proportional change of H index. Conclusion: The effect of self-citation is minimal in academic radiology, as evidenced by the fact that cumulative citations increase by only 2% and the large majority of H index values do not change by even a single integer after inclusion of self-citation."
"OBJECTIVE. Although some research and publication practices are clearly unethical, including fraud and plagiarism, other areas of research and publication, such as informed consent and conflicts of interest, fall into grayer areas. CONCLUSION. The purposes of this article are, therefore, to review a variety of relevant ethical issues in radiology-related journalism, peer review, and research; to review the radiology literature to date that has addressed these issues; and to present position statements and potential solutions to these problems."
"The study addresses the visibility of electronic scientific journals, as well as the characteristics that promote, especially focusing on those hosted on the Portal of Scientific Journals of the Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul. The study assesses the degree of visibility of these journals on the Internet by means of their presence in information sources. The theoretical reference addresses the following themes: scientific communication; scientific journals; visibility and searchability; information sources on portal; bibliographic databases and open access. This is a descriptive and exploratory study that combines qualitative and quantitative data. The corpus of research was composed of 34 titles. Essential information about the journals was collected, giving emphasis to the characteristics that promote their visibility. It was found that Human Sciences is the area with the greatest number of journals at the University, 29.4% of all publications. Open access is adopted by all journals in the sample. Once the information sources had been mapped, it was found that the majority of journals appear in the information source Latin American Periodicals Tables of Contents, followed by Latindex. Despite the limited presence of the journals in international information sources, it was concluded that the journals hosted on the Website of Scientific Journals seek to adapt to characteristics that promote their visibility. The study suggests a number of new studies, deepens the analyses, and addresses other themes related to visibility and, especially, bibliometric studies."
"Researchers often face dilemmas about authorship. When the researchers are graduate students, fellows, or junior faculty, the dilemmas might involve discussions about fair criteria for more senior faculty to be acknowledged as key contributors or authors on manuscripts. This ""Ethics Rounds"" presents a case in which a fellow faced such a dilemma. We review current journal guidelines for authorship and some ethical considerations that should help make this process more streamlined."
"The creation of some kind of representations depicting the current state of Science (or scientograms) is an established and beaten track for many years now. However, if we are concerned with the automatic comparison, analysis and understanding of a set of scientograms, showing for instance the evolution of a scientific domain or a face-to-face comparison of several countries, the task is titanically complex as the amount of data to analyze becomes huge and complex. In this paper, we aim to show that graph-based data mining tools are useful to deal with scientogram analysis. Subdue, the first algorithm proposed in the graph mining area, has been chosen for this purpose. This algorithm has been customized to deal with three different scientogram analysis tasks regarding the evolution of a scientific domain over time, the extraction of the common research categories substructures in the world, and the comparison of scientific domains between different countries. The outcomes obtained in the developed experiments have clearly demonstrated the potential of graph mining tools in scientogram analysis. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."
"Tenure decisions, key decisions in academic institutions, are primarily based on subjective assessments of candidates. Using a large-scale bibliometric database containing 198,310 papers published 1975-2012 in the field of operations research (OR), we propose prediction models of whether a scholar would perform well on a number of future success metrics using statistical models trained with data from the scholar's first five years of publication, a subset of the information available to tenure committees. These models, which use network centrality of the citation network, coauthorship network, and a dual network combining the two, significantly outperform simple predictive models based on citation counts alone. Using a data set of the 54 scholars who obtained a Ph. D. after 1995 and held an assistant professorship at a top-10 OR program in 2003 or earlier, these statistical models, using data up to five years after the scholar became an assistant professor and constrained to tenure the same number of candidates as tenure committees did, made a different decision than the tenure committees for 16 (30%) of the candidates. This resulted in a set of scholars with significantly better future A-journal paper counts, citation counts, and h-indexes than the scholars actually selected by tenure committees. These results show that analytics can complement the tenure decision-making process in academia and improve the prediction of academic impact."
"Weexamine the patterns of editorial collaboration in 20 leading finance journals, from 1994 to 2013. We investigate the social structure of editorship across journals, editorial positions, nationalities and affiliations. Our sociological argument is structured upon Bourdieu's (1988) concept of social and symbolic capital and Whitley's (2000) concept of norm. Our analysis identifies elite scientists who influence the orientation as well as the content of published research in finance. We find that the academic community of editors is rather permeably structured; it is spread around a dense core and a relatively scattered periphery. Moreover, we find that editorial board membership has become increasingly accessible to scientists of diverse nationalities, while, within the network, the number of cohesive subgroups decreases across the sample period.

"A new semi-automatic method is presented to standardize or codify addresses, in order to produce bibliometric indicators from bibliographic databases. The hypothesis is that this new method is very trustworthy to normalize authors' addresses, easy and quick to obtain. As a way to test the method, a set of already hand-coded data is chosen to verify its reliability: 136,821 Spanish documents (2006-2008) downloaded previously from the Web of Science database. Unique addresses from this set were selected to produce a list of keywords representing various institutional sectors. Once the list of terms is obtained, addresses are standardized with this information and the result is compared to the previous hand-coded data. Some tests are done to analyze possible association between both systems (automatic and hand-coding), calculating measures of recall and precision, and some statistical directional and symmetric measures. The outcome shows a good relation between both methods. Although these results are quite general, this overview of institutional sectors is a good way to develop a second approach for the selection of particular centers. This system has some new features because it provides a method based on the previous non-existence of master lists or tables and it has a certain impact on the automation of tasks. The validity of the hypothesis has been proved taking into account not only the statistical measures, but also considering that the obtaining of general and detailed scientific output is less time-consuming and will be even less due to the feedback of these master tables reused for the same kind of data. The same method could be used with any country and/or database creating a new master list taking into account their specific characteristics."
"A number of bibliometric studies point out that citation counts are a function of many variables besides scientific quality. In this paper our aim is to investigate these factors that usually impact the number of citation counts, using an extensive data set from the field of chemistry. The data set contains roughly 2000 manuscripts that were submitted to the journal Angewandte Chemie International Edition (AC-IE) as short communications, reviewed by external reviewers, and either published in AC-IE or, if not accepted for publication by AC-IE, published elsewhere. As the reviewers' ratings of the importance of the manuscripts' results are also available to us, we can examine the extent to which certain factors that previous studies demonstrated to be generally correlated with citation counts increase the impact of papers, controlling for the quality of the manuscripts (as measured by reviewers' ratings of the importance of the findings) in the statistical analysis. As the results show, besides being associated with quality, citation counts are correlated with the citation performance of the cited references, the language of the publishing journal, the chemical subfield, and the reputation of the authors. In this study no statistically significant correlation was found between citation counts and number of authors. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."
"Working in multidisciplinary teams has become a common feature of modern research processes. This situation inevitably leads to the question of how to decide on who to acknowledge as authors of a multi-authored publication. The question is gaining pertinence, since individual scientists' publication records are playing an increasingly important role in their professional success. At worst, discussions about authorship allocation might lead to a serious conflict among coworkers that could even endanger the successful completion of a whole research project. Surprisingly, there does not seem to be any discussion on the issue of ethical standards for authorship is the field of Cognitive Science at the moment. In this short review I address the problem by characterizing modern challenges to a fair system for allocating authorship. I also offer a list of best practice principles and recommendations for determining authors in multi-authored publications on the basis of a review of existing standards."
"An important topic in the scientific publication process is how well reviewers evaluate the quality of papers and how their recommendations influence editors' decisions to accept or reject papers. Additionally, a particular concern for researchers from China and other countries with rapidly developing scientific communities is whether there are potential biases affecting their manuscripts in the review process. To address these topics, we examined 4575 manuscripts submitted to the journal Biological Conservation. For the 2093 papers sent out for review, reviewer recommendations strongly influenced the outcome of the review process. Reviewer recommendations of accept and minor revision were similar in their positive effects on editor decisions, while papers receiving at least one recommendation of reject (""the kiss of death"") were almost always rejected. Papers with more consistent reviews (e.g. both reviewers recommending a major revision) had a greater chance of acceptance than did papers with more variation (e.g. minor revision and reject). We found no evidence of editor bias against papers from China; however, reviewer recommendation for papers from China had a greater degree of agreement than did reviewers of papers from English-speaking countries (e.g. intra-class correlation of 0.25 vs. 0.55), due to reviewers of papers from China often agreeing that papers should be rejected or require major revision. Reviewers from China judged papers from China more harshly than did reviewers from other countries. Our results demonstrate that the review process is not a crapshoot; reviewers are providing useful information and editors are using this information to make reasonable decisions.

"This article offers a mathematical model that is in line with three-dimensional informetrics. We show that the geometric distribution - often found in informetric processes of use to model the distributions of book loans in libraries, of citations, or of journals downloads in scientific databases - plays a surprising role. To show this, we infer the existence of another distribution, which we have called ""distribution of structure"". Distributions of use and distributions of structure are the two key processes in our three-dimensional IPP (Information Production Process). Furthermore, we indirectly introduce the time dependence of these distributions through the concept of information obsolescence. To demonstrate the theorems, we use the properties of probability-generating functions (PGF). (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."
"OBJECTIVE Bradford's law describes the scatter of citations for a given subject or field. It can be used to identify the most highly cited journals for a field or subject. The objective of this study was to use currently accepted formulations of Bradford's law to identify core journals of neurosurgery and neurosurgical subspecialties. METHODS All original research publications from 2009 to 2013 were analyzed for the top 25 North American academic neurosurgeons from each subspecialty. The top 25 were chosen from a ranked career h -index list identified from previous studies. Egghe's formulation and the verbal formulation of Bradford's law were applied to create specific citation density zones and identify the core journals for each subspecialty. The databases were then combined to identify the core journals for all of academic neurosurgery. RESULTS Using Bradford's verbal law with 4 zone models, the authors were able to identify the core journals of neurosurgery and its subspecialties. The journals found in the most highly cited first zone are presented here as the core journals. For neurosurgery as a whole, the core included the following journals: Journal of Neurosurgery, Neurosurgery, Spine, Stroke, Neurology, American Journal of Neuroradiology, International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics, and New England Journal of Medicine. The core journals for each subspecialty are presented in the manuscript. CONCLUSIONS Bradford's law can be used to identify the core journals of neurosurgery and its subspecialties. The core journals vary for each neurosurgical subspecialty, but Journal of Neurosurgery and Neurosurgery are among the core journals for each neurosurgical subspecialty."
"This article presents the methodological strategies, results and a critical analysis of the national research project MapCom ""The Research Sphere on Communication Studies Social Practices, Map of Projects, Groups, research objects and methods"". We present the results obtained within the first two phases of the research project. The complete sample of objects for analysis was selected within this time span, all doctoral research and research projects were included. We performed a specific analysis of descriptive variables associated to gender, objects of study, funding, more present methodologies, as well as a comparative analysis between research projects and doctoral theses from a perspective of the objects of study and the methodologies implemented. We contextualize the work with a comparative analysis of research in Social Science and Humanities in the same period analysed in Spain. We performed an analysis of the weaknesses, threats, strengths and opportunities which were detected within the analysis, and we propose recommendations aimed at developing a ""Strategic Action Plan for Competitive Research in Communication"". The analysis of this research concludes with the observation of similarities between the objects of study, but also of the differences between the objectives of the investigations when we compare doctoral theses and research projects in the analysed period. We also carried out a comparative analysis of the 12 most relevant universities in Spain, in order to identify differences, similarities and research patterns in research teams or groups, associate doctoral programs and universities."
"Here we consider the download statistics of EPL publications. We find that papers in the journal are characterised by fast accumulations of downloads during the first couple of months after publication, followed by slower rates thereafter, behaviour which can be represented by a model with predictive power. We also find that individual papers can be classified in various ways, allowing us to compare categories for open-access and non-open-access papers. For example, for the latter publications, which comprise the bulk of EPL papers, a small proportion (2%) display intense bursts of download activity, possibly following an extended period of less remarkable behaviour. About 18% have an especially high degree of attractiveness over and above what is typical for the journal. One can also classify the ageing of attractiveness by examining download half-lives. Approximately 18% have strong interest initially, waning in time. A further 20% exhibit ""delayed recognition"" with relatively late spurs in download activity. Although open-access papers enjoy more downloads on average, the proportions falling into each category are similar. Copyright (C) EPLA, 2014"
"From 2010 to 2014, the Journal of Medical and Biological Engineering (JMBE) published more than twice as many articles as it did during the previous 5-year period. This increase has raised significant information management and retrieval issues related to the emergence of ""big data"". Generally speaking, every publication has academic value and should be available to researchers. However, statistical assessments indicate that 95 % of studies are not cited by other publications. Some of these dormant articles could make significant contributions to medical and biological engineering research. Such studies are referred to as ""sleeping beauties"". The present study develops an information ""awakening"" framework to explain how to extract value from sleeping beauties. The proposed framework implements a web-based system through which researchers can propose effective awakening strategies, referred to as ""princes"". An analysis of experimental results found 14 sleeping beauties in JMBE, some of which were awakened by the two proposed princes, namely ""keyword prince"" and ""H-index prince"". The results are expected to provide journals with a clear way to promote published studies, and to make their findings more readily available to scholars."
"In the paper, we apply small world complex network theory to analyze scientific research in the field of service innovation, and discover its research focuses. Our study considers the key words and subject categories of the publications as actors to map keyword co-occurrence network and subject category co-occurrence network, and compare them with their corresponding random binary networks to judge whether these complex networks have the characteristics of small world network, in order to find the hot issues in the field by the small world network analysis. We discuss the knowledge structure in the field through analyzing 437 papers that were searched from Web of Science database over the period 1992-2011. We find that case study, service industry, service quality, market orientation, new product development, and knowledge management were the most popular keywords of the field, and also show the dynamic development of the research focuses in recent 10 years. The researchers who made most contribution in a certain field are also found out. It is concluded that there were more researchers who did investigation about service innovation in the category of Business and Economics, Engineering, Public Administration, Operations Research and Management Science, and Computer Science than those in other categories. The study suggests a quantitative method to analyze trends of scientific research in a certain field, and presents some directions of research mainstream to the researchers who may be interested in the service innovation."
"Brunei is a small tropical country-located in Southeast Asia - for which there are no previous bibliometric studies. Here we analyze papers published by Brunei scientists from 1973 to 2016 in the Science Citation Index Expanded and compare results with other tropical countries. We identified 1547 publications and 11 document types. The most productive categories were ecology, multidisciplinary geosciences, inorganic and nuclear chemistry, and environmental sciences. Singapore Medical Journal published most of these papers, and the three most productive institutions were Universiti Brunei Darussalam, RIPAS Hospital, and Universiti Teknologi Brunei. UK and Malaysia were the most frequent collaborating countries. M.A. Ali from the Universiti Brunei Darussalam was the most prolific author and a Brunei independent article written by C.K. Morley from the Universiti Brunei Darussalam in 2002 had the highest number of citations of the whole period and the highest number in 2016. The tropical countries of Central America and Asia have a few similarities but also important differences, and both are highly heterogeneous in scientific organization and productivity."
"This study uncovers the evolution of a fuel cell research network through a bibliometric study focusing on a period from 1991 to 2010. From a dataset of 37,435 research articles, the study focuses on the evolution of fuel cell research networks at a national level. Focusing solely on the expansion of the research networks, and the policies effecting collaboration, the paper poses three research questions (1) Is research into fuel cells more unconcentrated than in science overall and if so, (2) is there changes within time and (3) can we identify a cluster among certain countries. To answer the research questions, the data was compared to findings on the overall scientific output worldwide. In addition, an ego network analysis was performed and a modularity algorithm was used in order to identify clusters from the network data. The study showed that fuel cell research co-operation has had a distinct evolution within the time frame of the study. Research has increased in both volume and in co-operation, but research co-operation is more unconcentrated than in science overall. Non-TRIAD countries have a stronger role in fuel cell research than in science overall. Clusters in research co-operation have evolved into two modes of co-operation-one around Asia and North America and the second around European co-operation with US and Asia."
"In this work we develop new journal classification methods based on the h-index. The introduction of the h-index for research evaluation has attracted much attention in the bibliometric study and research quality evaluation. The main purpose of using an h-index is to compare the index for different research units (e.g. researchers, journals, etc.) to differentiate their research performance. However the h-index is defined by only comparing citations counts of one's own publications, it is doubtful that the h index alone should be used for reliable comparisons among different research units, like researchers or journals. In this paper we propose a new global h-index (Gh-index), where the publications in the core are selected in comparison with all the publications of the units to be evaluated. Furthermore, we introduce some variants of the Gh-index to address the issue of discrimination power. We show that together with the original h-index, they can be used to evaluate and classify academic journals with some distinct advantages, in particular that they can produce an automatic classification into a number of categories without arbitrary cut-off points. We then carry out an empirical study for classification of operations research and management science (OR/MS) journals using this index, and compare it with other well-known journal ranking results such as the Association of Business Schools (ABS) journal Quality Guide and the Committee of Professors in OR (COPIOR) ranking lists.

"In this study, the spatial-temporal transfer of research topics in the field of scientometrics was analysed through citation analysis and information visualization tools such as CiteSpace and Google Fusion Tables software. We collected 12,839 articles, including 214,748 references, about citation analysis in Science Citation Index-Expanded (SCI-E) and Social Science Citation Index (SSCI) databases for the period of 1971 to July 2016 as the data source. We obtained the following findings: The transfer of central research topics in the field of scientometrics is accelerating. There have been three milestones: the middle of the 1990s, 2005, and 2010. The number of central research topics has also changed from one between 1971 and 1993 to two after 1994 and three after 2008. At the same time, the geographical centres of scientometrics research showed a general shift from the US and Britain to Italy, the Netherlands, Belgium, Spain, and China. At present, the countries that are centres of research include the Netherlands, US, Belgium, China, Spain, and Italy. There is a close positive correlation between the transfer of the central research topic and the transformation of the country to a centre of research. The countries acting as centres of research enjoy not only a high output of literature, but also a great academic influence. Both the theoretical and practical implications of the results are discussed."
"Objective How researchers' contributions relate to author order on the byline remains unclear. We sought to identify researchers' contributions associated with author order, and to explore the existence of author profiles. Design Observational study. Setting Published record. Participants 1139 authors of 119 research articles published in 2015 in the Annals of Internal Medicine. Primary outcomes Presence or absence of 10 contributions, reported by each author, published in the journal. Results On average, first authors reported 7.1 contributions, second authors 5.2, middle authors 4.0, penultimate authors 4.5 and last authors 6.4 (p<0.001). The first author made the greatest contributions to drafting the article, designing the study, analysing and interpreting the data, and providing study materials or patients. The second author contributed to data analysis as well and to drafting the article. The last author was most involved in obtaining the funding, critically revising the article, designing the study and providing support. Factor analysis yielded three author profiles-Thinker (study design, revision of article, obtaining funding), Soldier (providing material or patients, providing administrative and logistical support, collecting data) and Scribe (analysis and interpretation of data, drafting the article, statistical expertise). These profiles do not strictly correspond to byline position. Conclusions First, second and last authors of research articles made distinct contributions to published research. Three authorship profiles can be used to summarise author contributions. These findings shed light on the organisation of clinical research teams and may help researchers discuss, plan and report authorship in a more transparent way."
"The availability of new technologies, combined with changing perceptions of traditional journal publications, has created a wave of ""new models'' for reviewing and publishing scientific research. As the Journal of Herpetology (JH) celebrates its 50th anniversary, this is an appropriate time for the membership of SSAR to consider what kinds of changes in JH are needed to meet the needs of those who publish research in herpetology. In this review, I focus on three issues with traditional models of journal publications: criticisms of the peer-review process (especially bias and elitism); issues with rapid communication of research findings; and increasing calls for better transparency and openness of data. For issues such as gender or age bias, I provide support for calls for changes such as double-blind reviews to reduce the prevalence of such bias and also review new methods for making peer reviews more open and efficient. Conversely, I find serious problems with mechanisms such as citable ""pre prints'' that have been suggested as a means to increase the speed at which research findings are made available and review alternate models that can accomplish the same goal without sacrificing the integrity of journal publications. Ultimately, how JH and other herpetological journals respond to these challenges will be an ongoing process in which the membership needs to be strongly engaged."
"Purpose - The purpose of this study is to contribute to the understanding of how the potential of altmetrics varies around the world by measuring the percentage of articles with non-zero metrics (coverage) for articles published from a developing region (Latin America). Design/methodology/approach - This study uses article metadata from a prominent Latin American journal portal, SciELO, and combines it with altmetrics data from Altmetric.com and with data collected by author-written scripts. The study is primarily descriptive, focusing on coverage levels disaggregated by year, country, subject area, and language. Findings - Coverage levels for most of the social media sources studied was zero or negligible. Only three metrics had coverage levels above 2 per cent - Mendeley, Twitter, and Facebook. Of these, Twitter showed the most significant differences with previous studies. Mendeley coverage levels reach those found by previous studies, but it takes up to two years longer for articles to be saved in the reference manager. For the most recent year, coverage was less than half than what was found in previous studies. The coverage levels of Facebook appear similar (around 3 per cent) to that of previous studies. Research limitations/implications - The Altmetric.com data used for some of the analyses were collected for a six month period. For other analyses, Altmetric. com data were only available for a single country (Brazil). Originality/value - The results of this study have implications for the altmetrics research community and for any stakeholders interested in using altmetrics for evaluation. It suggests the need of careful sample selection when wishing to make generalizable claims about altmetrics."
"We analyse why the open access movement split into two paths, gold and green, and try to explain the reasons behind the choices between them that were made in the UK and USA. The analysis shows that lobbying in favor of the gold path had its origins in the publication policies of The New England journal of medicine: its director, Franz J. Ingelfinger, introduced the publication rule of not accepting manuscripts that previously had been circulating as pre-prints, known as the ""Ingelfinger rule""."
"A baseline assessment research output is beneficial for policy decision makers to promote research. This paper presents a co-authorship network-based method to quantify and describe the scholarly publishing of a certain research field. To make our analysis more precise, we firstly generalized the measures used in previous literatures into formulas and analyzed the significance of the measures. We then classified our study into overall, individual, institutional and international levels to make our analysis clearer and more reasonable. Finally, we conduct a research of the structure, characteristics and development trend of co-authorship network based on publication output in top three journals in the field of information systems from 1993 to 2012. By synthetical analysis, our research results are helpful to know the productivity patterns, trends of the published research and status of international collaboration in this field."
"Higher education systems in competitive environments generally present top universities, that are able to attract top scientists, top students and public and private financing, with notable socio-economic benefits in their region. The same does not hold true for noncompetitive systems. In this study we will measure the dispersion of research performance within and between universities in the Italian university system, typically non-competitive. We will also investigate the level of correlation that occurs between performance in research and its dispersion in universities. The findings may represent a first benchmark for similar studies in other nations. Furthermore, they lead to policy indications, questioning the effectiveness of selective funding of universities based on national research assessment exercises. The field of observation is composed of all Italian universities active in the hard sciences. Research performance will be evaluated using a bibliometric approach, through publications indexed in the Web of Science between 2004 and 2008. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."
"The Spanish Foundation for Science and Technology (FECYT), within the project to support the professionalization and internationalization of Spanish scholarly journals (ARCE), carried out the first edition of assessing the quality of Spanish scientific journals in 2008. There are two main objectives to this work. Firstly, to describe and analyze the process itself its different features and assessment phases; secondly, to make proposals for improving future editions. In addition, we offer a quantitative study of the results. Despite the sample being relatively small the trends observed are interesting because they reflect the national landscape and are expected to be confirmed by a greater number of statistics in future editions."
"This study investigates, at the journal as well as the article level, if there is a difference in citations between English-language and non-English publications. The Web of Knowledge is used as data source. The investigation focuses on the fields of physics and chemistry. Using a precise definition of a ""non-English journal"", we filter out nine physics and thirty-four chemistry non-English journals, scattered over six physics and seven chemistry subfields. Average received citations per paper (CpP) of the non-English journal(s) are compared with the CpP of pure English journals, and this in the same subfield. We clearly observe that non-English journals are inferior-in number of citations received-to pure English journals and this in all physics and chemistry subfields studied. Further, twelve physics journals and ten chemistry journals were chosen as sample journals to compare the CpP of non-English papers with that of English language papers in the same journal. The result of this comparison is that for the majority of these journals and for most of the publication years the CpP of non-English papers is lower than that of the English language papers. Finally, analyzing linguistic characteristics of the citing literature confirms the own-language preference in non-English physics and chemistry journals."
"This paper studies the evolution of research productivity of a sample of economists working in the best 81 departments in the world in 2007. The main novelty is that, in so far as a productivity distribution can be identified with an income distribution, we measure productivity mobility in a dynamic context using an indicator inspired in an income mobility index suggested by Fields (2010) for a two-period world. Productivity is measured in terms of publications, weighted by the citation impact of the journals where each article is published in the periodical literature. We study the evolution of average productivity, productivity inequality, the extent of rank reversals, and productivity mobility for seven cohorts, as well as the population as a whole. We offer new evidence confirming previous results about the heterogeneity of the evolution of productivity for top and other researchers. However, the major result is that-contrary to what was expected-for our sample of very highly productive scholars the effect of rank reversals between the two periods on overall productivity mobility offsets the effect of an increase in productivity inequality from the first to the second period in the youngest five out of seven cohorts."
"As a new-style computer-mediated communication system, the blog has been gaining popularity among various Web users. Blog communities come into being in the process of self-organized communication between bloggers and the community structures are reflected by the embedded social networks. This study research the communication patterns of scientist bloggers with the data from the largest Chinese-language scientific blog community specializing in computer and information sciences and technologies, i.e. the Csdn blog. The social network analysis of its blogroll link data suggests that the Csdn blog community is a small-world network. Many sub-communities exist in the blog community. The communication between the central and ordinary bloggers within the same sub-community is usually one-way and dense. The structure of the Csdn blog community indicates that distributed central actors are still important in the diffusion and communication of scientific knowledge."
"Background: Despite its impact on female health worldwide, no efforts have been made to depict the global architecture of ovarian cancer research and to understand the trends in the related literature. Hence, it was the objective of this study to assess the global scientific performance chronologically, geographically and in regards to economic benchmarks using bibliometric tools and density equalizing map projections. Methods: The NewQIS platform was employed to identify all ovarian cancer related articles published in the Web of Science since 1900. The items were analyzed regarding quantitative aspects (e.g. publication date, country of origin) and parameters describing the recognition of the work by the scientific community (e.g. citation rates). Results: 23,378 articles on ovarian cancer were analyzed. The USA had the highest activity of ovarian cancer research with a total of n = 9312 ovarian cancer-specific publications, followed by the UK (n = 1900), China (n = 1813), Germany (n = 1717) and Japan (n = 1673). Ovarian cancer-specific country h-index also showed a leading position of the USA with an h-index (HI) of 207, followed by the UK (HI = 122), Canada (HI = 99), Italy (HI = 97), Germany (HI = 84), and Japan (HI = 81). In the socio-economic analysis, the USA were ranked first with an average of 175.6 ovarian cancer-related publications per GDP per capita in 1000 US-$, followed by Italy with an index level of 46.85, the UK with 45.48, and Japan with 43.3. Overall, the USA and Western European nations, China and Japan constituted the scientific power players publishing the majority of highly cited ovarian cancer-related articles and dominated international collaborative efforts. African, Asian and South American countries played almost no visible role in the scientific community. Conclusions: The quantity and scientific recognition of publications related to ovarian cancer are continuously increasing. The research endeavors in the field are concentrated in high-income countries with no involvement of lower-resource nations. Hence, worldwide collaborative efforts with the aim to exchange epidemiologic data, resources and knowledge have to be strengthened in the future to successfully alleviate the global burden related to ovarian cancer."
This paper is an attempt to convey in a lucid way how to go about writing a scientific article for publication in an appropriate journal. Topics covered are: a) reasons to write a paper b) types of papers c) asking a question and formulating an hypothesis d) the complex series of steps necessary before you begin your study e) additional considerations once your study is complete f) the process of writing the paper and g) writing skills. In the concluding remarks I comment on the possibility of rejection of your submission which should not be taken personally. If this does occur it should not deter you from contributing to medical science. (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.
"We focus on measuring relationships between pairs of objects in Wikipedia whose pages can be regarded as individual objects. Two kinds of relationships between two objects exist: in Wikipedia, an explicit relationship is represented by a single link between the two pages for the objects, and an implicit relationship is represented by a link structure containing the two pages. Some of the previously proposed methods for measuring relationships are cohesion-based methods, which underestimate objects having high degrees, although such objects could be important in constituting relationships in Wikipedia. The other methods are inadequate for measuring implicit relationships because they use only one or two of the following three important factors: distance, connectivity, and cocitation. We propose a new method using a generalized maximum flow which reflects all the three factors and does not underestimate objects having high degree. We confirm through experiments that our method can measure the strength of a relationship more appropriately than these previously proposed methods do. Another remarkable aspect of our method is mining elucidatory objects, that is, objects constituting a relationship. We explain that mining elucidatory objects would open a novel way to deeply understand a relationship."
"This study analyzed 2005-2006 Web of Science bibliometric data from institutions belonging to the Association of Research Libraries (ARL) and corresponding ARL statistics to find any associations between indicators from the two data sets. Principal components analysis on 36 variables from 103 universities revealed obvious associations between size-dependent variables, such as institution size, gross totals of library measures, and gross totals of articles and citations. However, size-independent library measures did not associate positively or negatively with any bibliometric indicator. More quantitative research must be done to authentically assess academic libraries' influence on research outcomes."
"This literature review assesses indicators derived from social media sources, including both general and academic sites. Such indicators have been termed altmetrics, influmetrics, social media metrics, or a type of webometric, and have recently been commercialised by a number of companies and employed by some publishers and university administrators. The social media metrics analysed here derive mainly from Twitter, Facebook, Google+, F1000, Mendeley, ResearchGate, and Academia. edu. They have the apparent potential to deliver fast, free indicators of the wider societal impact of research, or of different types of academic impacts, complementing academic impact indicators from traditional citation indexes. Although it is unwise to employ them in formal evaluations with stakeholders, due to their susceptibility to gaming and lack of real evidence that they reflect wider research impacts, they are useful for formative evaluations and to investigate science itself.

"This paper analyses the patterns of Danish research productivity, citation impact and (inter) national collaboration across document types 2000-2012, prior to and after the introduction of the Norwegian publication point-based performance indicator in 2008. Document types analysed are: research articles; conference proceedings papers excluding meeting abstracts; and review articles. The Danish Research & Innovation Agency's basic statistics combined with Web of Science (WoS) are used for data collection and analyses. Findings demonstrate that the research article productivity increases steeply (37 %) after the start of the performance indicator and the citation impact progresses linearly over the entire period, regardless the introduction of the performance indicator. Academic staff progression is only 24 % during the same time period. The collaboration ratio between purely Danish and internationally cooperated research articles remains stable during the period, the number of collaborative countries increases while the ratio declines significantly for proceedings papers. The citation impact of internationally cooperated research articles increases since 2009 but drops for proceedings papers; also their productivity declines slightly from 2009 according to Research Agency statistics. Since 2006 the WoS indexing of proceedings papers is fast declining; as a consequence the ratio between Danish proceedings papers and research articles declines in WoS. According to Research Agency statistics a decline likewise takes place, starting from 2009. The positive growth in research articles mainly derives from the Science and Technology fields published in prestigious Level 2 journals; the development of articles published in less prestigious Level 1 journals derives from all fields. Three of the eight Danish universities have significantly altered their research publication profiles since 2009. The publication performance model is regarded as the significant accelerator of these processes in recent years."
"We analyze the pay and position of 1009 faculty members who teach in doctoral-granting economics departments at 53 large public universities in the United States. Using the Web of Science, we have identified the journal articles published by these scholars and the number of times each of these articles has been subsequently cited in published research articles. We find that research influence, as measured by various measures of total citations, is a remarkably strong predictor of the salary and the prestige of the department in which professors are employed. We also examine the effect of coauthorship. Surprisingly, we find no salary penalty for sharing authorship; however, in terms of prestige of employing department, coauthorship is fully discounted."
"The ongoing globalisation of science has undisputedly a major impact on how and where scientific research is being conducted nowadays. Yet, the big picture remains blurred. It is largely unknown where this process is heading, and at which rate. Which countries are leading or lagging? Many of its key features are difficult if not impossible to capture in measurements and comparative statistics. Our empirical study measures the extent and growth of scientific globalisation in terms of physical distances between co-authoring researchers. Our analysis, drawing on 21 million research publications across all countries and fields of science, reveals that contemporary science has globalised at a fairly steady rate during recent decades. The average collaboration distance per publication has increased from 334 km in 1980 to 1553 km in 2009. Despite significant differences in globalisation rates across countries and fields of science, we observe a pervasive process in motion, moving towards a truly interconnected global science system.

"This study analyzes the status and background of authors publishing in high-impact library science journals. Twenty-three high-impact journals were selected in this study by both quantitative and qualitative measures, while the analysis of author background focuses on whether the author holds a faculty status position with a tenure track. This study finds that 76% of academic librarians publishing in top-tier library science journals have faculty status."
"Background: H-index serves as an alternative to measure academic achievement. Our objective is to study the h-index as a measure of academic attainment in general surgery and surgical specialties. Methods: A database of all surgical programs in the United States was created. Publish or Perish software was used to determine surgeons h-index. Results: A total of 134 hospitals and 3712 surgeons (79% male) were included. Overall, mean h-index was 14.9 +/- 14.8. H-index increased linearly with academic rank: 6.8 +/- 6.4 for assistant professors (n = 1557, 41.9%), 12.9 +/- 9.3 for associate professors (n = 891, 24%), and 27.9 +/- 17.4 for professors (n = 1170, 31.5%); P < 0.001. Thoracic surgery and surgical oncology had the highest subspecialty mean h-indices (18.7 +/- 16.7 and 18.4 +/- 17.6, respectively). Surgeons with additional postgraduate degrees, university affiliations and male had higher mean h-indices; P < 0.001. Scatterplot analysis showed a strong correlation between h-index and the number of publications (R2 = 0.817) and citations (R2 = 0.768). Conclusions: The h-index of academic surgeons correlates with academic rank and serves a potential tool to measure academic productivity. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved."
"Talent selection within science is increasingly performed by panels, e.g. by reviewing grant or fellowship applications. Many studies from fields of sociology of science and science policy studies have been conducted to identify biases and predict outcomes of these processes, mainly focusing on characteristics of applicants, applications, and reviewers. However, as panel reviewing entails social interaction, group dynamics influence these processes. By adding insights from social psychology to current knowledge on panel reviews, we are better able to identify factors affecting talent selection and funding decisions in grant panels. By opening up this so-called black box, we aim to contribute to a better understanding of the dynamics of panel decision making. This knowledge is also relevant for various stakeholders involved in grant allocation, for applicants, reviewers, and policymakers, as it can be used to improve transparency, fairness, and legitimation of talent selection processes."
"In this study the issue of the validity of the argument against the applied length of citation windows in Journal Impact Factors calculations is critically re-analyzed. While previous studies argued against the relatively short citation window of 1-2 years, this study shows that the relative short term citation impact measured in the window underlying the Journal Impact Factor is a good predictor of the citation impact of the journals in the next years to come. Possible exceptions to this observation relate to journals with relatively low numbers of publications, and the citation impact related to publications in the year of publication. The study focuses on five Journal Subject Categories from the science and social sciences, on normal articles published in these journals, in the 2 years 2000 and 2004."
"The seeking of evidence for revealing the research performance of Education in Taiwan, in response to the stimulus by the national research projects, is presented and interpreted. More than 70,000 publication records over the years 1990-2011 from Web of Science were downloaded and analyzed. The overview analysis by data aggregation and country ranking shows that Taiwan has significantly improved its publication productivity and citation impact over the last decade. The drill-down analysis based on journal bibliographic coupling, information visualization, and diversity and trend indexes, reveals that e-Learning and Science Education are two fast growing subfields that attract global interests and that Taiwan is among the top-ranked countries in these two fields in terms of research productivity. Implications of the analysis are discussed with an emphasis on the subfield characteristics from which more insightful interpretations can be obtained, such as the regional or cultural characteristics that may affect the performance ranking."
Using a very small sample of 8 data sets it was recently shown by De Visscher (2011) that the g-index is very close to the square root of the total number of citations. It was argued that there is no bibliometrically meaningful difference. Using another somewhat larger empirical sample of 26 data sets I show that the difference may be larger and I argue in favor of the g-index.
"Background: In the last few decades, health systems research (HSR) has garnered much attention with a rapid increase in the related literature. This study aims to review and evaluate the global progress in HSR and assess the current quantitative trends. Methods: Based on data from the Web of Science database, scientometric methods and knowledge visualization techniques were applied to evaluate global scientific production and develop trends of HSR from 1900 to 2012. Results: HSR has increased rapidly over the past 20 years. Currently, there are 28,787 research articles published in 3,674 journals that are listed in 140 Web of Science subject categories. The research in this field has mainly focused on public, environmental and occupational health (6,178, 21.46%), health care sciences and services (5,840, 20.29%), and general and internal medicine (3,783, 13.14%). The top 10 journals had published 2,969 (10.31%) articles and received 5,229 local citations and 40,271 global citations. The top 20 authors together contributed 628 papers, which accounted for a 2.18% share in the cumulative worldwide publications. The most productive author was McKee, from the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, with 48 articles. In addition, USA and American institutions ranked the first in health system research productivity, with high citation times, followed by the UK and Canada. Conclusions: HSR is an interdisciplinary area. Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development countries showed they are the leading nations in HSR. Meanwhile, American and Canadian institutions and the World Health Organization play a dominant role in the production, collaboration, and citation of high quality articles. Moreover, health policy and analysis research, health systems and sub-systems research, healthcare and services research, health, epidemiology and economics of communicable and non-communicable diseases, primary care research, health economics and health costs, and pharmacy of hospital have been identified as the mainstream topics in HSR fields. These findings will provide evidence of the current status and trends in HSR all over the world, as well as clues to the impact of this popular topic; thus, helping scientific researchers and policy makers understand the panorama of HSR and predict the dynamic directions of research."
"This article identifies and ranks 104 journals that might logically serve as the core for the interdisciplinary field of Health Economics. These journals are identified by analysing approximately 15 000 articles contained in the current CVs of 100 top health economists. Of the nearly 1200 journals spanned by these CVs, 104 journals were outlets for more than five of these top health economists. The 104 journals are ranked using eigenfactor and article influence scores as well as the percentile rank for each journal within its Institute for Scientific Information category. The primary intention is to create a broad-based journal list that exposes possible research outlets for aspiring health economists and to report the relative rankings of such outlets using established metrics."
"I challenge a finding reported recently in a paper by Sotudeh et al. (Scientometrics, 2015. doi: 10.1007/s11192-015-1607-5). The authors argue that there is a citation advantage for those who publish Author-Pay Open Access (Gold Open Access) in journals published by Springer and Elsevier. I argue that the alleged advantage that the authors report for journals in the social sciences and humanities is an artifact of their method. The findings reported about the life sciences, the health sciences, and the natural sciences, on the other hand, are robust. But my finding underscores the fact that epistemic cultures in the social sciences and humanities are different from those in the other fields."
"Chinese scientific journals are moving in the right direction but developing first-class academic journals still requires a number of obstacles to be overcome. Before the birth of any journal, a very complex journal approval system (JAS) must be negotiated. The paper will first present the history of the JAS in China and then analyze its effect on the scientific journal system. The JAS poses potential risks to the development of journals, and journal quantity rather than quality is the current priority. This needs to be changed and the JAS should be replaced by a journal registration system. Simultaneously, a system in which entry (start up) and closure, if required, is much easier than at present should be introduced, allowing the market to be the principal arbiter of success or failure.

"Cuban scientific output is analyzed for the period 2003-2011, in Scopus database. Based on a set of bibliometric indicators, we try to shed light on the evolution of the volume of scientific output in Cuban and foreign journals, and its distribution and visibility by quartiles. Also analyzed is the citation per document received, broken down by language of publication and type of collaboration. The results reveal patterns and strategies of expansion in scientific communication that may be useful for academic and institutional decision-makers, suggesting means of amending editorial policy to improve scientific quality and international diffusion of output. It is hoped that these results will spur debate about research policies and actions to be taken to enhance the quality of research."
"Hearing loss is a leading cause of disability in China. However, the research status in the field of hearing among Chinese individuals in the three major regions of China: Mainland (ML), Hong Kong (HK) and Taiwan (TW), are unknown. The output of hearing articles published in international otorhinolaryngology journals from these three regions were compared in this study. Articles published in 31 international otorhinolaryngology journals related to hearing originating from the ML, TW and HK from 2000 to 2011 were retrieved from the PubMed database search. The number of total articles, clinical trials, randomized controlled trials, case reports, and articles published in the top 5 international otorhinolaryngology journals were assessed in terms of quantity and quality comparisons. The total number of articles from the three regions increased significantly from 2000 to 2011. There were 379 articles from ML (143), TW (180) and HK (56) in the past 10 years. The number of articles published per year from the ML has exceeded those from TW in 2009 and HK in 2003. TW had the most articles (46) published in the top 5 international otorhinolaryngology journals among the three regions. The total number of articles from the three major regions of China increased significantly from 2000 to 2011. The numbers of articles published per year from the ML have exceeded those from TW and HK. However, the quality of articles from TW is better than that from ML."
"In bibliometrics, the association of ""impact"" with central-tendency statistics is mistaken. Impacts add up, and citation curves therefore should be integrated instead of averaged. For example, the journals MIS Quarterly and Journal of the American Society for Information Science and Technology differ by a factor of 2 in terms of their respective impact factors (IF), but the journal with the lower IF has the higher impact. Using percentile ranks (e. g., top-1%, top-10%, etc.), an Integrated Impact Indicator (I3) can be based on integration of the citation curves, but after normalization of the citation curves to the same scale. The results across document sets can be compared as percentages of the total impact of a reference set. Total number of citations, however, should not be used instead because the shape of the citation curves is then not appreciated. I3 can be applied to any document set and any citation window. The results of the integration (summation) are fully decomposable in terms of journals or institutional units such as nations, universities, and so on because percentile ranks are determined at the paper level. In this study, we first compare I3 with IFs for the journals in two Institute for Scientific Information subject categories (""Information Science & Library Science"" and ""Multidisciplinary Sciences""). The library and information science set is additionally decomposed in terms of nations. Policy implications of this possible paradigm shift in citation impact analysis are specified."
"A thermodynamic analogy allows bibliometric research assessment of information production processes to be based on a scalar indicator which is an energy-like term called exergy. Derived from standard indicators like impact, citations and number of papers, the exergy indicator X is a multiplicative product of quality and quantity of a scientist's or group's performance using available bibliometric information. Thus, given the bibliometric sequences of leading research agencies and institutions, research performance can be displayed as trajectories on a two-dimensional map as time progresses. In this paper, we track the performance of several of the leading players contributing to academic scientific research in India."
"In many real-life text mining applications such as clustering academic documents, citation matching and author name disambiguation (AND), similar publications are grouped together by exploiting similarity among them. Most of AND approaches, especially unsupervised ones, focus on either proposing new/alternate algorithms and/or using new/alternate sources of information. Researchers from digital library community pay least attention to similarity measures. They try ready-made alternate measures to estimate optimum similarity among publications. These ready-made measures may not provide real picture of similarity among publications. In this work, we propose four similarity measures specially designed for author names, co-authors and short and long text segments. Our proposed measures provide more realistic picture of similarity among publications than previous measures. Our proposed measures can be applied in many real-life scenarios where either name entities (not necessarily human names) or text documents or both are compared in pairwise fashion. We compare our measures with Jaccard coefficient and state-of-the-art cosine measure based on vector space model. Experiments on synthetic and real data show that our proposed measures are more logical and realistic than baseline methods."
"Currently, the evaluation of scientific journals is one of the most important tools in scientific policy, and points awarded for publications in journals play a key role in assessing the achievements of researchers and in the parametric evaluation of scientific institutions. The aim of the study was to examine the contribution of Polish journals from the field of life sciences with Impact Factor in the international bibliometric databases (Web of Science (TM), Scopus, Google Scholar, Index Copernicus) as well as in the lists of the Ministry of Science and Higher Education in Poland. The bibliometric analysis dealt with seven journals: Acta Biologica Cracoviensia Series Botanica, Archives of Environmental Protection, Dendrobiology, Acta Theriologica (currently Mammal Research), Polish Journal of Ecology Acta Societatis Botanicorum Poloniae and Sylwan. The bibliometric techniques most often used in specialized databases were analysed based on the values of following indicators: Impact Factor, Hirsch Index, Egghe Index, SClmago Journal Rank and Index Copernicus Value. Acta Theriologica (category 'zoology'), which was the most cited title with the highest value of the Impact Factor, was the most influential periodic in Polish science in 2000-2015 period among the analysed journals. In case of Dendrobiology and Sylwan, i.e. journals belonging to the 'forestry' category, the previous was listed higher in the analysed databases. However, the continuous increase in the value of Impact Factor and, as a consequence the development of the journal prestige, are observed for Sylwan."
"This paper aims to illustrate the cross-boundary research collaboration (CBRC) landscape of waste management (WM) by various collaboration networks. Through a set of rigorous procedures, a total of 15,396 research papers were extracted from eight subject-related journals published between 1981 and 2016. The authors utilized CiteSpace, a Java programme that helps visualize and dissect patterns in scientific literature, to evaluate the content through individual, institutional, national, and disciplinary perspectives. The evaluations of three former perspectives revealed a steady rise in CBRC within WM over the last thirty-five years, although the overall intensities proved fairly low. Inter-individual collaboration groups were limited to their respective regions and only loosely connected, but as more and more academic institutions and universities engaged in WM research, the number and quality of the collaborations increased. Developed countries, chiefly in North America and Western Europe, comprised the bulk of the WM research, whilst the mounting contributions from developing countries, China in particular, forecasts greater diversity in the future. The analysis also suggested that the intensity of the interdisciplinary collaboration network declined slightly, however, the intensity proved low to begin with. Previous WM research focused more on ""hard"" technologies than ""soft"" measures. Future endeavors to encourage CBRC in WM should promote more innovative research to tackle waste challenges globally in a sustainable way."
"OBJECTIVE: Analyze the use of the h-index as a measure of the bibliometric impact of Brazilian researchers' scientific publications. METHODS: The scientific production of Brazilian CNPq 1-A researchers in the areas of public health, immunology and medicine were compared. The mean h-index of the groups of researchers in each area were estimated and nonparametric Kruskal Wallis test and multiple comparisons Behrens-Fisher test were used to compare the differences. RESULTS: The h-index means were higher in the area of Immunology than in Public Health and Medicine when the Web of Science base was used. However, this difference disappears when the comparison is made using Scopus or Google Scholar. CONCLUSIONS: The emergence of Google Scholar brings a new level to discussions on the measure of the bibliometric impact of scientific publications. Areas with strong professional components, in which knowledge is produced and must also be published in the native language, vis-a-vis its dissemination to the international community, necessarily have a standard of scientific publications and citations different from areas exclusively or predominantly academic and they are best captured by Google Scholar."
"This study surveyed the use of institutional repositories (IRs) for searching information resources, self-archiving and preservation of research publications of academics in five Nigerian universities. The descriptive survey research method was adopted for the study. The population consisted of 491 academics and five repository librarians from the five universities that have their IR in Open DOAR. Questionnaire and interview were used for data collection. Data collected from the questionnaire were analysed using percentages. The findings showed that the most archived documents were journal articles. The information contents were utilised to a large extent; the submission of content for archiving on IR was very low; journal articles, conference/seminar papers were the materials mostly submitted for archiving in IR. The implication of the study is that since the academics utilise the content of IR to a large extent but the rate of their submission is very low, there is need for sensitisation and creating awareness on the importance and use of IR."
"Teams are ranked to show their authority over each other. Existing methods rank the cricket teams using an ad-hoc points system entirely based on the winning and losing of matches and ignores number of runs or wickets from which a team wins. In this paper, adoptions of h-index and PageRank are proposed for ranking teams to overcome the weakness of existing methods. Each team is represented by a node in the graph with two teams creates a weighted directed edge between each other by playing a match and the losing team points to the winning team. The intuition is to get more points for a team winning from a stronger team than winning from a weaker team by considering the number of runs or wickets also in addition to just winning and losing matches. The results show that proposed ranking methods provide quite promising insights of one day and test team rankings. The effect of damping factor d is also studied on the performance of PageRank based methods on both ODI and test matches teams ranking and interesting trends are found. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

"Previous studies have confirmed the interdisciplinary nature of the field of public administration (Mosher 1956; Ventriss 1991; Forrester 1996; Rodgers and Rodgers 2000; Schroeder et al. 2004) and encouraged the exploration of one important indicator of interdisciplinarity: research collaboration. One way that collaboration patterns are explored is through the study of co-authorship among faculty members (Smart and Bayer 1986; Forrester 1996; Katz and Martin 1997). In the field of public administration, studies on co-authorship and productivity of scholars are sparse. In this article, we use bibliometric data to explore collaboration patterns as they relate to productivity levels and quality of publications within the field of public administration. Our study finds that more productive scholars, as well as those with the highest impact, are less likely to collaborate than their colleagues. Our results also indicate that there are gender differences in collaboration patterns and productivity within the field of public administration."
"Purpose - Quantitative methods, especially statistical methods, play an increasingly important role in research of library and information science (LIS). For different journals, the uses of statistical methods vary substantially due to different journal scopes and aims. The purpose of this paper is to explore the characteristics of statistical methodology uses in six major scholarly journals in LIS. Design/methodology/approach - Research papers that used statistical methods from the six major journals were selected and investigated. Content analysis method, descriptive statistical analysis method, and temporal analysis method were used to compare and analyze statistical method uses in research papers of the investigated journals. Findings - The findings of this study show that there was a clear growth trend of statistical method uses in five of the investigated journals; statistical methods were used most in The Journal of the Association for Information Science and Technology and Information Processing & Management; and the top three most frequently used statistical methods were t-test, ANOVA test, and chi(2)-test. Originality/value - The findings can be used to better understand the application areas, patterns, and trends of statistical methods among the investigated journals and their statistical methodology orientations in research studies of LIS."
"The fall of the Iron Curtain led to an influx of new mathematical ideas into western science. We show that research teams grew disproportionately in size in subfields of mathematics in which the Soviets were strongest. This is consistent with the knowledge burden hypothesis that an outward shift in the knowledge frontier increases the returns to collaboration. We also report additional evidence consistent with this interpretation: (i) The effect is present in countries outside the United States and is not correlated with the local population of Soviet scholars, (ii) Researchers in Soviet-rich subfields disproportionately increased their level of specialization."
"The unbalanced international scientific collaboration as cause of misleading information on the country's contribution to the scientific world output was analyzed. ESI Data Base (Thomson Reuters' InCites), covering the scientific production of 217 active countries in the period 2010-2014 was used. International collaboration implicates in a high percentage (33.1 %) of double-counted world articles, thus impacting qualitative data as citations, impact and impact relative to word. The countries were divided into three groups, according to their individual contribution to the world publications: Group I (24 countries, at least 1 %) representing 83.9 % of the total double-counted world articles. Group II (40 countries, 0.1-0.99 % each). Group III, 153 countries (70.5 %) with < 0.1 % and altogether 1.9 % of the world. Qualitative characteristics of each group were also analyzed: percentage of the country's GNP applied in R&D, proportion of Scientists and Engineers per million inhabitants and Human Development Index. Average international collaboration were: Group I, 43.0 %; Group II, 55.8 % and Group III, 85.2 %. We concluded that very high and unbalanced international collaboration, as presented by many countries, misrepresent the importance of their scientific production, technological and social outputs. Furthermore, it jeopardizes qualitative outputs of the countries themselves, artificially increasing their scientific impact, affecting all fields and therefore, the whole world. The data confirm that when dealing with the qualitative contribution of countries, it is necessary to take in consideration the level of international cooperation because, as seen here, it can and in fact it does create false impression of the real contribution of countries."
"Engaged scholarship is an intellectual movement sweeping across higher education, not only in the social and behavioral sciences but also in fields of natural science and engineering. It is predicated on the idea that major advances in knowledge will transpire when scholars, while pursuing their research interests, also consider addressing the core problems confronting society. For a workable engaged agenda in science and technology studies, one that informs scholarship as well as shapes practice and policy, the traditional terms of engagement must be renegotiated to be more open and mutual than has historically characterized the nature of inquiry in this field. At the same time, it is essential to protect individual privacy and preserve government confidentiality. Yet there is a scientific possibility for and benefit to introducing more collaborative and deliberative research approaches between scholar and subject in ways that will not violate these first-order ethics. To make the case, this article discusses the possibilities and perils of engaged science and technology scholarship by drawing on our own recent experiences to conduct and apply STS research while embedded in the National Science Foundation. Brief accounts of these experiences reveal the opportunities as well as the challenges of engaged scholarship. They also provide lessons for those fellow travelers who might follow the authors to this or other like host organizations with ambitions of increasing fundamental knowledge about and applying research to the policies, programs, and decisions of the scientific enterprise."
"An elite segment of the academic output gap between Denmark and Norway was examined using harmonic estimates of publication credit for contributions to Science and Nature in 2012 and 2013. Denmark still leads but the gap narrowed in 2013 as Norway's credit increased 58%, while Denmark's credit increased only 5.4%, even though Norway had 36% fewer, and Denmark 40% more, coauthor contributions than in 2012. Concurrently, the credit produced by the least productive half of the contributions rose tenfold from 0.9% to 10.1% for Norway, but dropped from 7.2% to 5.7% for Denmark. Overall, contributory inequality as measured by the Gini coefficient, fell from 0.78 to 0.51 for Norway, but rose from 0.63 to 0.68 for Denmark. Neither gap narrowing nor the positive association between reduced contributory inequality and increased credit were detected by conventional metrics. Conventional metrics are confounded by equalizing bias (EqB) which favours small contributors at the expense of large contributors, and which carries an element of reverse meritocracy and systemic injustice into bibliometric performance assessment. EqB was corrected by using all relevant byline information from every coauthored publication in the source data. This approach demonstrates the feasibility of using EqB-corrected publication credit in gap assessment at the national level. (C) 2015 The Author. Published by Elsevier Ltd."

"Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), which is divided into three subfields, including Chinese medicine, Chinese herb and acupuncture, attracts increasing attentions due to its challenging and significant medical values. This study employs bibliometric analysis to examine the profile of publication activity in TCM field as well as its subfields. The data are retrieved from the Science Citation Index Expanded database during 1980-2009, and 16,536 papers are identified for analysis. Generally speaking, proportions of papers in subfield of acupuncture decreased dramatically, while the proportions of papers of Chinese medicine and Chinese herb rose increasingly. This study finds that East Asia has the largest number of TCM papers, followed by North America and Europe. Furthermore, while China is ranked first in terms of the amount of TCM publications, USA gains the highest percentage of citations. As for regional specialty, mainly, scholars in East Asia publish intensively in Chinese medicine, while most of the scholars in North America and Europe probe into the study of acupuncture. In the latest two decades, China took the first place over Japan in subfields of both Chinese medicine and Chinese herb, while the US has always kept the largest share in acupuncture with a marked upward trend. Regarding the top-ranked TCM institution, Chinese Academy of Sciences located in China, is ranked first in the subfields of Chinese medicine and Chinese herb as well. As for Kyung Hee University, which is located in South Korea, is ranked first in the number of acupuncture papers and Harvard University is ranked first in number of acupuncture citations."
"The article reflects on open access as a strategy of changing the quality of science communication globally. Successful examples of open-access journals are presented to highlight implications of archiving in open digital repositories for the quality and citability of research output. Advantages and downsides of gold, green, and hybrid models of open access operating in diverse scientific environments are described. It is assumed that open access is a global trend which influences the workflow in scholarly journals, changing their quality, credibility, and indexability."
"The journal impact factor (JIF) proposed by Garfield in the year 1955 is one of the most prominent and common measures of the prestige, position, and importance of a scientific journal. The JIF may profit from its comprehensibility, robustness, methodological reproducibility, simplicity, and rapid availability, but it is at the expense of serious technical and methodological flaws. The paper discusses two core problems with the JIF: first, citations of documents are generally not normally distributed, and, furthermore, the distribution is affected by outliers, which has serious consequences for the use of the mean value in the JIF calculation. Second, the JIF is affected by bias factors that have nothing to do with the prestige or quality of a journal (e.g., document type). For solving these two problems, we suggest using McCall's area transformation and the Rubin Causal Model. Citation data for documents of all journals in the ISI Subject Category ""Psychology, Mathematical"" (Journal Citation Report) are used to illustrate the proposal. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

"Academic associations are a vital part of the academic community, facilitating the interaction of researchers and production of knowledge, yet the impact of Open Access on their future has been too often regarded as marginal to the main discussion. Open Access presents an evident threat to those associations, which have become dependent upon a sizeable proportion of their income coming from owned journals published in conjunction with publishers. Yet, Open Access also presents opportunities, and academic associations should be bold in using a combination of their expertise, prestige and experience in publishing to ensure their futures in a newly emerging market."
"Trauma continues to be a leading cause of mortality and morbidity in lower to middle-income countries. To meet the ever-growing need of musculoskeletal care in trauma patients, orthopaedic surgeons play an instrumental role in providing care, guided by relevant clinical research studies. Promoting research and publishing results are both crucial to influencing trauma-related skeletal injury treatment in lower to middle-income countries. Currently, few opportunities exist for trauma surgeons in Latin America to participate in clinical research or to contribute to academic publications, thereby limiting their ability to address potentially critical treatment questions faced by their specific patient populations. In response to these obstacles, in 2017, a group of 60 surgeon leaders representing 18 countries throughout Latin America developed the Asociacion de Cirujanos Traumatologos de las Americas (ACTUAR; www.actuarla.org ).

"A journal may be considered as having dimension-specific prestige when its score, based on a given journal ranking model, exceeds a threshold value. But a journal has multidimensional prestige only if it is a prestigious journal with respect to a number of dimensionse.g., Institute for Scientific Information Impact Factor, immediacy index, eigenfactor score, and article influence score. The multidimensional prestige of influential journals takes into account the fact that several prestige indicators should be used for a distinct analysis of the impact of scholarly journals in a subject category. After having identified the multidimensionally influential journals, their prestige scores can be aggregated to produce a summary measure of multidimensional prestige for a subject category, which satisfies numerous properties. Using this measure of multidimensional prestige to rank subject categories, we have found the top scientific subject categories of Web of Knowledge as of 2010."
"The last decade has seen an enormous increase in the number of peer-reviewed open access research journals in which authors whose articles are accepted for publication pay a fee to have them made freely available on the Internet. Could this popularity of open access publishing be a bad thing? Is it actually imperiling the future of science? In this commentary, I argue that it is. Drawing upon research literature, I explain why it is almost always best to publish in society journals (i.e., those sponsored by research societies such as Journal of Wildlife Management) and not nearly as good to publish in commercial academic journals, and worstto the point it should normally be opposedto publish in open access journals (e.g., PLOS ONE). I compare the operating plans of society journals and open access journals based on 2 features: the quality of peer review they provide and the quality of debate the articles they publish receive. On both features, the quality is generally high for society journals but unacceptably low for open access journals, to such an extent that open access publishing threatens to pollute science with false findings. Moreover, its popularity threatens to attract researchers' allegiance to it and away from society journals, making it difficult for them to achieve their traditionally high standards of peer reviewing and of furthering debate. I prove that the commonly claimed benefits to science of open access publishing are nonexistent or much overestimated. I challenge the notion that journal impact factors should be a key consideration in selecting journals in which to publish. I suggest ways to strengthen the Journal and keep it strong.

"This article studies citation practices in the arts and humanities from a theoretical and conceptual viewpoint, drawing on studies from fields like linguistics, history, library & information science, and the sociology of science. The use of references in the humanities is discussed in connection with the growing interest in the possibilities of applying citation analysis to humanistic disciplines. The study shows how the use of references within the humanities is connected to concepts of originality, to intellectual organization, and to searching and writing. Finally, it is acknowledged that the use of references is connected to stylistic, epistemological, and organizational differences, and these differences must be taken into account when applying citation analysis to humanistic disciplines."
"In the humanities and social sciences, bibliometric methods for the assessment of research performance are (so far) less common. This study uses a concrete example in an attempt to evaluate a research institute from the area of social sciences and humanities with the help of data from Google Scholar (GS). In order to use GS for a bibliometric study, we developed procedures for the normalization of citation impact, building on the procedures of classical bibliometrics. In order to test the convergent validity of the normalized citation impact scores, we calculated normalized scores for a subset of the publications based on data from the Web of Science (WoS) and Scopus. Even if scores calculated with the help of GS and the WoS/Scopus are not identical for the different publication types (considered here), they are so similar that they result in the same assessment of the institute investigated in this study: For example, the institute's papers whose journals are covered in the WoS are cited at about an average rate (compared with the other papers in the journals)."
"The reason of higher number of citations of some articles is discussed. Some considerations about the journals' impact factor, its merits and its pitfalls are also made. Scientific journals' impact factor, popularized by the Institute for Scientific Information, has become an objective parameter for authors' evaluation and also for institutions and other related circumstances. There is no reason for the impact factor's gap between some English journals and those written in other languages. English journals probably benefit of the ""Mathew's effect"", according to which eminent scientists are more rewarded by similar contributions than others less known. It is paradoxical that most of the major achievements of our age do not appear among the 100 most cited articles. There is no homogeneity among all the articles appearing in each scientific journal: half of the articles are cited ten times more than the other half. However, those articles cited 0 times are credited like the better ones. Each article should be evaluated by its own citations, which would be its impact factor; the authors should be evaluated by their H index."
"Digital imaging has provided scientists with new opportunities to acquire and manipulate data using techniques that were difficult or impossible to employ in the past. Because digital images are easier to manipulate than film images, new problems have emerged. One growing concern in the scientific community is that digital images are not being handled with sufficient care. The problem is twofold: (1) the very small, yet troubling, number of intentional falsifications that have been identified, and (2) the more common unintentional, inappropriate manipulation of images for publication. Journals and professional societies have begun to address the issue with specific digital imaging guidelines. Unfortunately, the guidelines provided often do not come with instructions to explain their importance. Thus they deal with what should or should not be done, but not the associated 'why' that is required for understanding the rules. This article proposes 12 guidelines for scientific digital image manipulation and discusses the technical reasons behind these guidelines. These guidelines can be incorporated into lab meetings and graduate student training in order to provoke discussion and begin to bring an end to the culture of ""data beautification""."
"The distribution of impact factors has been modeled in the recent informetric literature using two-exponent law proposed by Mansilla, Koppen, Cocho, and Miramontes (2007). This paper shows that two distributions widely-used in economics, namely the Dagum and Singh-Maddala models, possess several advantages over the two-exponent model. Compared to the latter, the former models give as good as or slightly better fit to data on impact factors in eight important scientific fields. In contrast to the two-exponent model, both proposed distributions have closed-from probability density functions and cumulative distribution functions, which facilitates fitting these distributions to data and deriving their statistical properties.

"The number of authors from different countries have recently increased in ecology papers, but the international collaboration among ecologists does not occur in an idiosyncratic way. In this paper, we quantified the level of international collaboration in ecology papers and the influence of geographic distance and socioeconomic factors on collaboration between countries. We obtained all papers from Thomson-ISI, classified as subject ecology between years 2000 and 2014 (total of 62,667 papers with international collaboration in 179 countries). The gravity model (binomial negative model) indicated that the level of international collaboration is moderate spatially structured, decreasing as the geographical distance among countries increase. Moreover, the geographic distance and socioeconomic factors explained 10% of the scientific collaboration among countries (Pseudo R-2 = 0.10). Highly collaborative countries were found in similar trade blocs, with similar Human Development Index, similar scientific structure (i.e., number of citation per documents) and tended to be geographically close. Thus, international collaboration will continue increasing, and young ecologists will experience international collaboration, even with distant countries (both geographical and socioeconomic)."
"Introduction: The number of scientific papers is a conventional metric for the measurement of a countrys research performance in a particular area. Objective: To evaluate the trend in Iranian publications of dental research results in peer-reviewed international scientific journals over the period 1999-2009, using national and international databases, and to compare the results with other countries. Methods: The search process was performed by two independent persons in PubMed and Iranian Medline (IranMedex). Data extraction included the year of publication, total number of dental papers in each year, total number of Iranian dental papers in each year and number of papers with a high level of evidence; these were compared with those in other Asian countries. Results: The total number of dental articles indexed in PubMed during the studied period was 207,689, with 671 being written by researchers who stated their affiliation as Iran. Although the proportion of Iranian dental articles to all published dental articles was 0.01% in 1990, this increased to 1.4% in 2009. Of all clinical trials indexed in PubMed from 1990 to 2009, only 0.62% had an author from Iran. The collaboration rate of authors ranged between 1 and 10. Turkey and Iran had a larger number of dental research publications compared with other Asian countries assessed in this study. Conclusion: During the last two decades, there has been a considerable increase in the number of dental papers by Iranian researchers indexed in the PubMed database."
"The development of science is accompanied by growth of scholarly publications, primarily in the form of articles in peer-reviewed journals. Scientific work is often evaluated through the number of scientific publications in international journals and their citations. This article discusses the impact of open access (OA) on the number of citations for an institution from the field of civil engineering. We analyzed articles, published in 2007 in 14 international journals with impact factor, which are included in the Journal Citation Reports subject category ""Civil Engineering"". The influence of open access on the number of citations was analyzed. The aim of our research was to determine if open access articles from the field of civil engineering receive more citations than non-open access articles. Based on the value of impact factor and ranking in quartiles, we also looked at the influence of the rank of journals on the number of citations, separately for OA and Non OA articles, in databases Web of Science (WOS), Scopus and Google Scholar. For 2,026 studied articles we found out that 22 % of them were published as OA articles. They received 29 % of all citations in the observed period. We can conclude by the significance level 5 % or less that in the databases WOS and Scopus the articles from top ranked journals (first quartile) achieved more citations than Non OA articles. This argument can be confirmed for some other journals from second quartile as well, while for the journals ranked into the third quartile it can't be confirmed. This could be confirmed only partly for journals from the second quartile, and would not be confirmed for journals ranked into the third quartile. This shows that open access is not a sufficient condition for citation, but increases the number of citations for articles published in journals with high impact."
"The Ranking Web of World Repositories ( http://repositories.webometrics.info) is introduced. The objective is to promote Open access initiatives (OAI) supporting the use of repositories for scientific evaluation purposes. A set of metrics based on web presence, impact and usage is discussed. The Ranking is built on indicators obtained from web search engines following a model close to the Impact Factor one. The activity accounts for a 50% of the index, including number of pages, pdf files and items in Google Scholar database, while the visibility takes into account the external inlinks received by the repository (the other 50%). The Ranking provides the Top 300 repositories from a total of 592 worldwide, with a strong presence of US, German and British institutional repositories and the leadership of the large subject repositories. Results suggest the need to take into consideration other file formats and the usage information, an option is not feasible today."
"This study compares Spanish and UK research in eight subject fields using a range of bibliometric and social media indicators. For each field, lists of Spanish and UK journal articles published in the year 2012 and their citation counts were extracted from Scopus. The software Webometric Analyst was then used to extract a range of altmetrics for these articles, including patent citations, online presentation mentions, online course syllabus mentions, Wikipedia mentions and Mendeley reader counts and Altmetric.com was used to extract Twitter mentions. Results show that Mendeley is the altmetric source with the highest coverage, with 80 % of sampled articles having one or more Mendeley readers, followed by Twitter (34 %). The coverage of the remaining sources was lower than 3 %. All of the indicators checked either have too little data or increase the overall difference between Spain and the UK and so none can be suggested as alternatives to reduce the bias against Spain in traditional citation indexes."
"The paper addresses the issue of the transatlantic gap in research excellence between Europe and USA by examining the performance of individual universities. It introduces a notion of leadership in research excellence by combining a subjective definition of excellence with an objective one. It applies this definition to a novel dataset disaggregated for 251 Subject Categories, covering the 2007-2010 period, based on Scopus data. The paper shows that European universities are able to show excellence only in a few disciplinary areas each, while US universities are able to excel across the board. It explains this difference in terms of institutional differences in recruitment process and governance of universities. It discusses the European model of distributed excellence in terms of the recent rise of input competition. (C) 2017 Published by Elsevier Ltd."
"In January 2007, the Chilean Journal of Agricultural Research was indexed by the Institute of Scientific Information (ISI). This paper reviews the research that has been published since 2007 by using records extracted from the Web of Science database. The papers published were mostly affiliated to researchers from Chile, and six out of the ten most-contributing countries were from Latin America. The analysis by institutions showed Universidad de Concepcion as the most prolific, although this result is not valid. A lack of standardization in the manner the Instituto de Investigaciones Agropecuarias (INIA) subscribed its address on each paper caused a disaggregation of the information. This was proven by the manual curation of each record that was affiliated to any of the centers belonging to INIA. The journal has a self-citation rate of 19.3%, value that is relatively high if compared to other journals from the same subject category listed on The Journal Citation Reports 2010. Finally, this work should be considered a bibliometric snapshot of the current situation of the journal that will serve as a benchmark when new evaluations are made in a few-years time."
"Scholarly journals play an important role in maintaining the quality and integrity of research by what they publish. Unethical practices in publishing are leading to an increased number of predatory, dubious and low-quality journals worldwide. It has been reported that the percentage of research articles published in predatory journals is high in India. The University Grants Commission (UGC), New Delhi has published an 'approved list of journals', which has been criticized due to inclusion of many substandard journals. We have developed a protocol with objective criteria for identifying journals that do not follow good publication practices. We studied 1336 journals randomly selected from 5699 in the university source component of the 'UGC-approved list'. We analysed 1009 journals after excluding 327 indexed in Scopus/Web of Science. About 34.5% of the 1009 journals were disqualified under the basic criteria because of incorrect or non-availability of essential information such as address, website details and names of editors; another 52.3% of them provided false information such as incorrect ISSN, false claims about impact factor, claimed indexing in dubious indexing databases or had poor credentials of editors. Our results suggest that over 88% of the non-indexed journals in the university source component of the UGC-approved list, included on the basis of suggestions from different universities, could be of low quality. In view of these results, the current UGC-approved list of journals needs serious re-consideration. New regulations to curtail unethical practices in scientific publishing along with organization of awareness programmes about publication ethics at Indian universities and research institutes are urgently needed."
"In this paper, we extend the study of the intelligent transportation system (ITS) topic evolution presented by Li et al. To do so, we apply an approach that combines both H-index-based performance analysis and science mapping to detect, visualize, and evaluate conceptual ITS themes and ITS thematic areas published by the journal IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INTELLIGENT TRANSPORT SYSTEMS during the decade (2000-2009). The primary consequence of this is the detection of three important thematic areas: COMPUTER-VISION and TRAFFIC-FLOW, which are related to research in ITS applied to vehicles, and AIRCRAFT-TRAFFIC, which is related to research in ITS applied to aircraft/airport."
"Context: Research, development, and innovation are becoming increasingly important in the rapidly changing political, financial, and social landscape of the world. It is important to understand the landscape of research and development in developing courtiers, as research and development has been shown to improve developing countries' economic growth. The aim of this study was to obtain a snap shot of a bibliometric analysis of the publications in the field of microbiology in sub - Saharan Africa (SSA). Among other questions, this study aimed at determining the most published authors, the most common areas of research, and institutes with the greatest number of publications in this field. Evidence Acquisition: This study was conceptualised using 3 steps: creating a search strategy that encompasses the major fields of microbiology, creating and executing a search query, and analysing the results. Scopus was chosen as the search engine since it is the largest database of peer - reviewed literature and includes original articles, reviews, conferences, letters, editorials, and articles - in - press, etc. Conclusions: Although at first glance it may seem that SSA contributed very little towards (less than 2%) the worlds microbiology literature, a closer examination of gross domestic product (GDP) spent on research proves that SSA countries are making inroads in publishing literature. Most literature published over the last 14 years has been journal articles in journals with an impact factor of 3.7. In 2014, most articles were published in journals with an average impact factor of 6.1. In terms of the number of publications by the top authors in the field, it seems as if they quantitatively match other international countries like Brazil and India."
"The h-index-defined as the value such that an individual has published at least h papers with at least h citations-has become a popular metric for assessing the citation impact of scientists. As already noted in the original work of Hirsch and as evidenced from data for a representative sample of 255 physicists, root c scales as h, where c is the total number of citations for an individual. Thus root c appears to be equivalent to the h-index. As a further check of this equivalence, the distribution of the ratio s equivalent to root c/2h for this sample is sharply peaked about 1. The outliers in this distribution reveal fundamentally different kinds of individual publication records."
"This study investigated changes in the internationality of national publishers' journals for the period 1990-2013. The patterns of foreign and interregional authorship in papers and references of 4,199 journals from 3,529 publishers were analyzed. The results revealed that foreign authorship increased from 36% to 62% during the period, but interregional authorship only grew from 77% to 82%. The growth in internationality is not the same across disciplines and regions of the world. Agricultural sciences, psychiatry/psychology, and economics and business have the least number of foreign authors, while journals in space science, mathematics, and physics have the most. According to the number of both foreign-authored papers and foreign-authored citations, clinical medicine is one of the least international fields. Latin America and Middle East publishers have a greater tendency to publish papers from authors in their countries. In contrast, national publishers in North America have become considerably more international over time. Russia, China, and Brazil publish the least number of foreign authored-papers in their journals, while Switzerland's journals publish the most. (C) Ali Gazni 2015"
"Using a database of recent articles published in the field of Global Health research, we examine institutional sources of stratification in publishing access outcomes. Traditionally, the focus on inequality in scientific publishing has focused on prestige hierarchies in established print journals. This project examines stratification in contemporary publishing with a particular focus on subscription vs. various Open Access (OA) publishing options. Findings show that authors working at lower-ranked universities are more likely to publish in closed/paywalled outlets, and less likely to choose outlets that involve some sort of Article Processing Charge (APCs; gold or hybrid OA). We also analyze institutional differences and stratification in the APC costs paid in various journals. Authors affiliated with higher-ranked institutions, as well as hospitals and non-profit organizations pay relatively higher APCs for gold and hybrid OA publications. Results suggest that authors affiliated with high-ranked universities and well-funded institutions tend to have more resources to choose pay options with publishing. Our research suggests new professional hierarchies developing in contemporary publishing, where various OA publishing options are becoming increasingly prominent. Just as there is stratification in institutional representation between different types of publishing access, there is also inequality within access types."
"This article proposes a parametric approach for facilitating inter-metric and inter-field comparisons of citation-based journal ranking metrics. The mechanism is simple to apply and adjusts for metric magnitude differentials and distributional asymmetries in the rank-score curves. The method is demonstrated using h-index, AWCR-index, g-index, and e-index data from journals in Accounting, Economics, and Finance."
"This paper studies evidence from Thomson Scientific (TS) about the citation process of 3.7 million articles published in the period 1998-2002 in 219 Web of Science (WoS) categories, or sub-fields. Reference and citation distributions have very different characteristics across sub-fields. However, when analyzed with the Characteristic Scores and Scales (CSS) technique, which is replication and scale invariant, the shape of these distributions over three broad categories of articles appears strikingly similar. Reference distributions are mildly skewed, but citation distributions with a 5-year citation window are highly skewed: the mean is 20 points above the median, while 9-10% of all articles in the upper tail account for about 44% of all citations. The aggregation of sub-fields into disciplines and fields according to several aggregation schemes preserve this feature of citation distributions. It should be noted that when we look into subsets of articles within the lower and upper tails of citation distributions the universality partially breaks down. On the other hand, for 140 of the 219 sub-fields the existence of a power law cannot be rejected. However, contrary to what is generally believed, at the sub-field level the scaling parameter is above 3.5 most of the time, and power laws are relatively small: on average, they represent 2% of all articles and account for 13.5% of all citations. The results of the aggregation into disciplines and fields reveal that power law algebra is a subtle phenomenon."
"This study attempts to model the growth behavior of the number of publications and patents of South Korea, Taiwan, Japan and Malaysia. Three competing growth functions, namely, simple logistic growth function, bi-logistic growth function and logistic function within a dynamic carrying capacity were considered. The findings provide insight to the diffusion process of science and technology, often measured by the number of publications and patents, respectively. The function that provides the best fit to the observed data was opted for explaining the diffusion process. The function with the best fit is the bi-logistic growth function for the number of publications as well as the number of patents of South Korea and Taiwan, the logistic growth function within a dynamic carrying capacity (LGDCC) for the number of publications and the bi-logistic growth function for the number of patents of Japan, and the LGDCC for the number of publications and simple growth function for the number of patents of Malaysia. The results suggest a dynamic self-propagating growth for the science and technology, and thereby a transition from science and technology-push to market-pull growth for South Korea and Taiwan. While a similar transition was observed for the technology of Japan, the growth in science had entered a maturity stage. On the other hand, the growth potential in science is dynamic for Malaysia, but its technological advancement is relatively lower and static compared to the other economies. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

"In this paper, the interaction of the reviewers is analyzed in the context of the open peer review. There, the reviewer group can exchange comments on the manuscript. This group of experts is called the informed reviewer group because, with the exchange of comments, each reviewer knows about the trends in the evaluation of the manuscript. Then, we show that, in a Bayesian Nash equilibrium, the probability that the editor chooses to accept or reject is the same. In this paper, this reviewer group is also compared to a group of uninformed reviewers in the classic review system. In this second case, the uninformed reviewers only communicate with the journal editor. They always believe that their recommendation is in the majority, and the probability that the uninformed reviewers abstain from making any recommendation increases as the number of reviewers grows. In some open access journals, the editor can obtain recommendations by both uninformed and informed reviewers groups. In this situation, the editor's decision could depend on the order followed by the editor in the analysis of the recommendations of each reviewers group (informed and uninformed). A free online tool has been created to help the editor with this process."
"Purpose - In the past few decades, there has been a lot of literature about trust research for business and management. However, few authors have applied co-citation analysis. Design/methodology/approach - Trust is one of the most discussed issues in management, as it has proved to have an essential role in business operations. In this study, all citation documents are included in Thomson Reuters ISI Web of Knowledge database from 1992 to 2010. Findings - By using statistics analysis including factor analysis, cluster analysis and multidimensional scaling, researchers identified four domains, including organizational behaviour, strategic alliance, marketing and social capital. Directions for future research are discussed. Originality/value - This study is the first to apply co-citation techniques in the fields of trust. Therefore, the major contribution of this study is to provide an intellectual structure and trends within the field of trust from an objective and quantitative perspective."
"Contemporary academic environment can be characterized by an overwhelming trend toward enhancing research productivity and knowledge creation. The purpose of this study is to examine the impact of radical social change and subsequent institutional pressures on internationally relevant knowledge creation. The setting examined is business and economics science in Eastern Europe. Using a case study of Slovenian business schools and deploying a bibliometric analysis we find that research productivity is increasing significantly. We note however dilemmas pertaining to the content and quality of knowledge created. Further, we find that international research cooperation has positive quality effects. From a theoretical perspective, we argue that radical social change was not mirrored by such change in normative institutions, whereas recent changes in regulatory institutions seem to have a substantial positive effect on research performance.

"There is increasing evidence that citations to Chinese research publications are rising sharply. A series of reasons have been highlighted in previous studies. This research explores another possibilitywhether there is a clubbing effect in China's surge in research citations, in which a higher rate of internal citing takes place among influential Chinese researchers. Focusing on the most highly cited research articles in nanotechnology, we find that a larger proportion of Chinese nanotechnology research citations are localized within individual, institutional, and national networks within China. Both descriptive and statistical tests suggest that highly cited Chinese papers are more likely than similar U.S. papers to receive internal and localized citations. Tentative explanations and policy implications are discussed."
"Background The big problem in global public health, arising from the international migration of physicians from less-developed to more-developed countries, increases if this migration also affects scientists dedicated to health areas. This article analyzes critical variables in the processes of Spanish scientific mobility in Health Sciences to articulate effective management policies for the benefit of national public health services and the balance between local and global science. Methods This study develops a survey to measure and analyze the following crucial variables: research career, training, funding, working with a world-class team, institutional prestige, wages, facilities/infrastructure, working conditions in the organization of the destination country, fringe benefits in the organization of the destination country and social responsibility in the organization of the departure country. A total of 811 researchers have participated in the survey, of which 293 were from the health sector: Spanish scientists abroad (114), scientists that have returned to Spain (32) and young researchers in Spain (147). Results The most crucial variables for Spanish scientists and young researchers in Spain in Health Sciences moving abroad are the cumulative advantages (research career, training, funding and institutional prestige) plus wages. On the other hand, the return of Spanish scientists in the Health Sciences is influenced by cumulative variables (working with a world-class team, research career and institutional prestige) and also by other variables related to social factors, such as working conditions and fringe benefits in the destination country. Permanent positions are rare for these groups and their decisions regarding mobility depend to a large extent on job opportunities. Conclusions Spanish health organizations can influence researchers to return, since these decisions mainly depend on job opportunities. These organizations can complement the cumulative advantages offered by the wealthier countries with the intensification of social factors."
"This work proposes a set of indicators based on patent documents that allow researchers to represent and analyse the behaviour of technological production within a particular domain. This proposal is here validated via a case stucdy. Collected data were processed employing an in-house tool designed for use in patentometric studies. Latin American. technological knowledge published in the USA between September 7996 and April 1997 was examined, paying special attention to that of Brazil, The largest Latin American filer of patents. The set of patentometric indicators. proposed allows one to quantify and qualify the behaviour of technological production in terms of the patents granted. Using The patents analysed, the technological capacity revealed in the different technical areas covered is represented, along with The ranking of institutes, research centres and industries, etc. The productivity of their principal technologists and their relationships is also shown. The latter element of analysis favours cooperation and technological exchange, as well as the identification of priorities and opportunities. The above information is an aid for the planning, implementation and assessment of research and technological development policies at any level. This kind of analysis is considered an indispensable tool for improving our knowledge of regional technological resources. It also encourages the better use of existing technological capacities."
"Peer review serves a gatekeeper role, the final arbiter of what is valued in academia, but is widely criticized in terms of potential biases-particularly in relation to gender. In this substantive-methodological synergy, we demonstrate methodological and multilevel statistical approaches to testing a null hypothesis model in relation to the effect of researcher gender on peer reviews of grant proposals, based on 10,023 reviews by 6233 external assessors of 2331 proposals from social science, humanities, and science disciplines. Utilizing multilevel cross-classified models, we show that support for the null hypothesis model positing researcher gender has no significant effect on proposal outcomes. Furthermore, these non-effects of gender generalize over assessor gender (contrary to a matching hypothesis), discipline, assessors chosen by the researchers themselves compared to those chosen by the funding agency, and country of the assessor. Given the large, diverse sample, the powerful statistical analyses, and support for generalizability, these results - coupled with findings from previous research - offer strong support for the null hypothesis model of no gender differences in peer reviews of grant proposals.

"This paper analyzes the effects of the co-authorship and bibliographic coupling networks on the citations received by scientific articles. It expands prior research that limited its focus on the position of co-authors and incorporates the effects of the use of knowledge sources within articles: references. By creating a network on the basis of shared references, we propose a way to understand whether an article bridges among extant strands of literature and infer the size of its research community and its embeddedness. Thus, we map onto the article - our unit of analysis - the metrics of authors' position in the co-authorship network and of the use of knowledge on which the scientific article is grounded. Specifically, we adopt centrality measures - degree, betweenneess, and closeness centrality - in the co-authorship network and degree, betweenness centrality and clustering coefficient in the bibliographic coupling and show their influence on the citations received in first two years after the year of publication. Findings show that authors' degree positively impacts citations. Also closeness centrality has a positive effect manifested only when the giant component is relevant. Author's betweenness centrality has instead a negative effect that persists until the giant component - largest component of the network in which all nodes can be linked by a path - is relevant. Moreover, articles that draw on fragmented strands of literature tend to be cited more, whereas the size of the scientific research community and the embeddedness of the article in a cohesive cluster of literature have no effect."
"The article opens with a critical analysis of the dominant business model of for-profit, academic publishing, arguing that the extraordinarily high profits of the big publishers are dependent upon a double appropriation that exploits both academic labour and universities' financial resources. Against this model, we outline four possible responses: the further development of open access repositories, a fair trade model of publishing regulation, a renaissance of the university presses, and, finally, a move away from private, for-profit publishing companies toward autonomous journal publishing by editorial boards and academic associations."
"We performed a thorough comparison of four main indicators of journal influence, namely 2-year impact factor, 5-year impact factor, eigenfactor and article influence. These indicators have been recently added by Thomson Reuters to the Journal Citation Reports, in both science and social science editions, and are thus available for study and comparison over a sample of significative size. We find that the distribution associated with the eigenfactor largely differs from the distribution of the other surveyed measures in terms of deviation from the mean, concentration, entropy, and skewness. Moreover, it is the one that best fits to the lognormal theoretical model. Surprisingly, the eigenfactor is also the most variable indicator when computed across different fields of science and social science, while article influence is the most stable in this respect, and hence the most suitable metric to be used interdisciplinarily. Finally, the journal rankings provided by impact factors and article influence are relatively similar and diverge from the one produced by eigenfactor, which is closer to that given by the total number of received citations.

"This paper examines impact of gender both on publication productivity and on patterns of scientific collaborations in social sciences in Turkey. The research is based on bibliographic data on national level publications in Turkey. It consists of 7,835 papers written by 6,738 scientists. The findings suggest that (1) there are gender differences at publication productivity, participation, presence and contribution; that (2) there are significantly different tendencies at keeping established co-authorship ties for inter-gender and intra-gender pairs; that (3) there are significant regularities exhibited by coauthor pairs based on each partner author's publication productivity and findings further show that (4) regularities are different for inter-gender and intra-gender co-authorships. This study contributes to literature by exemplifying an integrated approach to better examine role of gender in scientific collaborations. In addition to descriptive social network analysis methods, it exploits and adopts parametric models from the literature: (1) Social Gestalt theory, a model based on bi-variate distributions of co-author pairs' frequencies; (2) Lotka's power law distribution on publication productivity of single authors; (3) Power law distributions of co-author pairs' frequencies."
"The current study applies the hIa metric of Harzing et al. (Scientometrics 99(3):811-821 2014) to examine average faculty research performance across 5 Colleges in a single university. Average faculty performance for a range of common metrics of research publication such as papers, citations and h-index are presented to allow for a comparison of the degree to which the hIa can account for differences in publication patterns and career lengths in the current sample of faculty (N = 474). Scopus publication data for all faculty members across 5 Colleges was collected and analyzed to evaluate the assertion that the hIa provides a more reliable metric for comparison between academics of different career lengths, and academics researching in different disciplines. Comparison of current results with the results from the original work of Harzing et al. (Scientometrics 99(3):811-821 2014) offer strong support for the usefulness of the hIa in qualitatively and quantitatively different academic environments. Results are discussed in relation to the potential value and appropriate use of the hIa metric."
"This paper presents the inferential analysis of a systematic survey of North American library and information science (LIS) faculty awareness of, attitudes towards and experience with open-access scholarly publishing. The study reveals that engagement with open access is related to faculty rank and perceptions about tenure and promotion committee assessments of open-access publications. The perceived constraints of the tenure and promotion system within the academy impact LIS faculty engagement with open-access publishing in ways found in other academic disciplines. However, those who themselves engage with open access tend to assess publications in such venues more favourably than those without such publishing experience and are similarly more predisposed to believe that tenure and promotion committees would evaluate such publications favourably. Nonetheless, while in general it is clear that experience with open access reduces some of the concerns about the effects of this type of scholarly publishing on career opportunities, there remains a substantial amount of equivocacy among LIS faculty about open access."
The objective of this article is to show how the techniques of regional science and peace science can be applied for the economic development of poor countries. This article also describes techniques for integrating regional science and peace science.
"The spread of ideas in the scientific community is often viewed as a competition, in which good ideas spread further because of greater intrinsic fitness, and publication venue and citation counts correlate with importance and impact. However, relatively little is known about how structural factors influence the spread of ideas, and specifically how where an idea originates might influence how it spreads. Here, we investigate the role of faculty hiring networks, which embody the set of researcher transitions from doctoral to faculty institutions, in shaping the spread of ideas in computer science, and the importance of where in the network an idea originates. We consider comprehensive data on the hiring events of 5032 faculty at all 205 Ph.D.-granting departments of computer science in the U.S. and Canada, and on the timing and titles of 200,476 associated publications. Analyzing five popular research topics, we show empirically that faculty hiring can and does facilitate the spread of ideas in science. Having established such a mechanism, we then analyze its potential consequences using epidemic models to simulate the generic spread of research ideas and quantify the impact of where an idea originates on its longterm diffusion across the network. We find that research from prestigious institutions spreads more quickly and completely than work of similar quality originating from less prestigious institutions. Our analyses establish the theoretical trade-offs between university prestige and the quality of ideas necessary for efficient circulation. Our results establish faculty hiring as an underlying mechanism that drives the persistent epistemic advantage observed for elite institutions, and provide a theoretical lower bound for the impact of structural inequality in shaping the spread of ideas in science."
"The Semantic Web (SW) is one of the main efforts aiming to enhance human and machine interaction by representing data in an understandable way for machines to mediate data and services. It is a fast-moving and multidisciplinary field. This study conducts a thorough bibliometric analysis of the field by collecting data from Web of Science (WOS) and Scopus for the period of 1960-2009. It utilizes a total of 44,157 papers with 651,673 citations from Scopus, and 22,951 papers with 571,911 citations from WOS. Based on these papers and citations, it evaluates the research performance of the SW by identifying the most productive players, major scholarly communication media, highly cited authors, influential papers and emerging stars."
"Intra-institutional collaboration is an often neglected type of research collaboration from the literature. This study aimed to understand what factors contribute to this type of collaboration as well as what types of factors can impact negatively the likelihood of this collaboration. We deployed a survey in a US research institution and measured for factors relating to environmental, past researcher behavior and personal research characteristics. We developed a model that demonstrates how these sets variables influence intra-institutional collaboration and developed recommendations for units. Unit support for collaboration and past behavior were found to impact intra-institutional collaboration. Additionally, researcher's attitudes toward sharing knowledge and resources were also found to impact the likelihood for collaboration within institution."
"While there is a considerable body of literature that presents the results of citation analysis studies, most researchers do not provide enough detail in their methodology to reproduce the study, nor do they provide rationale for methodological decisions. In this paper, we review the methodologies used in 34 recent articles that present a ""user study"" citation analysis with a goal of informing collection management. We describe major themes and outliers in the methodologies and discuss factors that require careful thought and analysis. We also provide a guide to considerations for citation analysis studies, so that researchers can make informed decisions."
"Newly introduced bibliometric indices may be biased by the preference of scientists for bibliometric indices, in which their own research receives a high score. To test such a hypothesis, the publication and citation records of nine scientists who recently proposed new bibliometric indices were analyzed in terms of standard indicators, their own indicators, and indicators recently proposed by other scientists. The result of the test was negative, that is, newly introduced bibliometric indices did not favor their authors. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."
"digital history techniques and methods, we suggest a need to find new, uniform strategies that use the most commonly used standards and protocols in the international scholarly community, so we can construct digitally tagged corpora for future systematic analysis. We review the traditional criteria used to describe newssheets, using the concept of seriality and propose a customized xml/TEI schema to codify this type of texts. We present the preliminary results of the mapping of the news flow networks in the Modern age in Europe. Finally, the conclusions shed some light on the relevance and benefits of applying digital humanities tools to the study of the first European manifestations of what was to become known as 'journalism'."
"This study explores the connections between social and usage metrics (altmetrics) and bibliometric indicators at the author level. It studies to what extent these indicators, gained from academic sites, can provide a proxy for research impact. Close to 10,000 author profiles belonging to the Spanish National Research Council were extracted from the principal scholarly social sites: ResearchGate, Academia.edu and Mendeley and academic search engines: Microsoft Academic Search and Google Scholar Citations. Results describe little overlapping between sites because most of the researchers only manage one profile (72%). Correlations point out that there is scant relationship between altmetric and bibliometric indicators at author level. This is due to the almetric ones are site-dependent, while the bibliometric ones are more stable across web sites. It is concluded that altmetrics could reflect an alternative dimension of the research performance, close, perhaps, to science popularization and networking abilities, but far from citation impact.

"Objectives: To compare the research productivity of different Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries in the field of biomedical sciences from 2011-2013. Methods: This is a retrospective study conducted in the College of Medicine, Alfaisal University, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. Data on the biomedical publications originating from GCC countries published between January 2011 to December 2013 was searched via MEDLINE using PubMed. The total number of publications emanating from each country was normalized with the country's population. The mean impact factor (IF) of all the publications in a year was calculated for comparative analysis. Results: A total of 11,000 publications were retrieved via MEDLINE using PubMed, out of which, 9222 were selected for analysis. A successive increase in the number of publications by every country was observed. The most striking increase in the number of publications was from Saudi Arabia. However, after normalization with population, the performance of Oman, Qatar, and Kuwait looks far better than Saudi Arabia in terms of research productivity. Data on mean IF showed that the overall mean IF of all GCC countries has remained largely unchanged except Oman. Although Oman had a comparatively low mean IF value in 2011, they recorded a tremendous improvement in successive years. Conclusion: All GCC countries underwent an increase in quantitative research productivity over the last 3 years. However, no increase in quality of research publications was noted based on the proxy reports of mean journal IF."
"Objective: To assess whether there is a preference for international journal citation to the detriment of national ones in ten Brazilian medical journals, in two different periods. Methods: All references in the articles published in Arquivos Brasileiros de Oftalmologia, Revista Brasileira de Cirurgia Cardiovascular, Revista da Associacao Medica Brasileira, Sao Paulo Medical Journal, Arquivos Brasileiros de Endocrinologia e Metabologia, Clinics, Jornal Brasileiro de Pneumologia, Revista da Sociedade Brasileira de Medicina Tropical, Revista Brasileira de Psiquiatria e Acta Ortopedica Brasileira in the years 2011 and 2007 were analyzed, assessing the number of articles published in national and international journals. Results: A total of 36,125 references from 1,462 articles published in the 10 aforementioned journals were analyzed. Of the total number, 4.242 (11.74%) were from Brazilian journals. There was no significant difference between the two analyzed periods. A total of 453 (30,98%) of the articles studied non-cited brazilian papers, and 81 (5.54%) articles had more Brazilian than international references. Conclusion: Of total references analyzed, 11.74% were related to articles published in Brazilian journals. This number, when compared to the percentage of Brazilian articles published in the medical area, demonstrates a good number of citations of national articles. (C) 2012 Elsevier Editora Ltda.

"An increasing number of nations allocate public funds to research institutions on the basis of rankings obtained from national evaluation exercises. Therefore, in non-competitive higher education systems where top scientists are dispersed among all the universities, rather than concentrated among a few, there is a high risk of penalizing those top scientists who work in lower-performance universities. Using a 5 year bibliometric analysis conducted on all Italian universities active in the hard sciences from 2004 to 2008, this work analyzes the distribution of publications and relevant citations by scientists within the universities, measures the research performance of individual scientists, quantifies the intensity of concentration of top scientists at each university, provides performance rankings for the universities, and indicates the effects of selective funding on the top scientists of low-ranked universities."
"Publication fees as a revenue source for open access publishing hold a prominent place on the agendas of researchers, policy makers, and academic publishers. This study contributes to the evolving empirical basis for funding these charges and examines how much German universities and research organisations spent on open access publication fees. Using self-reported cost data from the Open APC initiative, the analysis focused on the amount that was being spent on publication fees, and compared these expenditure with data from related Austrian (FWF) and UK (Wellcome Trust, Jisc) initiatives, in terms of both size and the proportion of articles being published in fully and hybrid open access journals. We also investigated how thoroughly self-reported articles were indexed in Crossref, a DOI minting agency for scholarly literature, and analysed how the institutional spending was distributed across publishers and journal titles. According to self-reported data from 30 German universities and research organisations between 2005 and 2015, expenditures on open access publication fees increased over the years in Germany and amounted to 9,627,537 for 7,417 open access journal articles. The average payment was 1,298, and the median was is an element of 1,231. A total of 94% of the total article volume included in the study was supported in accordance with the price cap of 2,000, a limit imposed by the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG) as part of its funding activities for open access funding at German universities. Expenditures varied considerably at the institutional level. There were also differences in how much the institutions spent per journal and publisher. These differences reflect, at least in part, the varying pricing schemes in place including discounted publication fees. With journals articles indexing coverage of 99%, Crossref thoroughly indexed the open access articles included in the study. A comparison with the related openly available cost data from Austria and the UK revealed that German universities and research organisations primarily funded articles in fully open access journals. By contrast, articles in hybrid journal accounted for the largest share of spending according to the Austrian and UK data. Fees paid for hybrid journals were on average more expensive than those paid for fully open access journals."
"Sound statistical analysis is fundamental to high-quality reporting of quantitative studies. Peer review are also important in determining whether statistical procedures in submitted manuscripts are appropriate and effectively reported. However, the quality of statistical reviews of manuscripts submitted to nursing journals has not been previously evaluated. The purpose of this project was to compare the content and quality of statistical and scientific (general) reviews of manuscripts submitted to Nursing Research. The General Assessment of Reviews of Nursing Research (GARNR) and the Statistical Assessment of Reviews of Nursing Research (SARNR) were used to evaluate 105 reviews of 35 manuscripts assigned to both scientific and statistical review between August 2007 and February 2009. Scientific reviews were rated as more comprehensive, but most did not evaluate statistical aspects of a manuscript. Statistical reviews were more likely to identify fatal flaws, were generally rated higher in overall usefulness to the editor in making a decision on whether to publish, and were rated as more useful to authors for improving a manuscript. Statistical and scientific reviews are complementary and both are necessary. More thorough integration of substantive and methodological content in reviews of quantitative studies has potential for even greater leverage of effort and improved quality of nursing research reports."
"BackgroundThe Hirsch index (h-index) is widely recognized as a reliable measure of academic productivity. While previous studies have applied the h-index to surgical disciplines, none have analyzed microsurgery faculty. This manuscript aims to examine the h-index of microsurgery fellowship faculty to categorize its applicability to microsurgeons as a determinant of academic output. MethodsFaculty demographics and institution characteristics were obtained from the American Society of Reconstructive Microsurgery (ASRM) and official program websites. Faculty h-indices were calculated using the Scopus database (Elsevier, USA). Data was assessed using bivariate analysis and multiple linear regression models to determine the relationship between independent variables and total publications, career h-index and 5-year h-index (h5-index) of each faculty. ResultsA total of 139 faculties from 22 programs met inclusion criteria. The median faculty age was 44 (IQR 13) and 84.9% of faculty were male. Faculty size, number of years of fellowship existence, number of fellows, FACS memberships, number of free flaps annually, and academic appointment title were significantly associated with the total publications, h-index, and h5-index. Multivariable analysis based on the significant independent variables demonstrated that geographical region and faculty ranks were significantly associated with the h5-index. ConclusionsVariables associated with seniority (age, years of practice after fellowship, and academic appointment) were positively correlated with the h-index. Given the increased use of bibliometrics in academic medicine, these results show that h-index is a viable tool that can be used to assess research productivity among academic microsurgeons."
"Medical journals are published by scientific societies, universities, publishing agencies and other for-profit or non-profit organizations. The traditional way to cover the expenses in printed journals has been a ""subscribers pay"" model. The rise of electronic versions in the internet, either together with the printed version or replacing it entirely, plus a progressive adherence to an ""open access"" for electronic versions, has created financial difficulties. Therefore, the ""authors pay"" model has been added. Both models can be subsidized by commercial or institutional advertising, but still a main source for financing relies either in subscriptions or in authors' payments. A small source of income that helps to cover publishing costs is a ""charge for manuscript reception"": currently applied by several journals. Those authors whose work has institutional or external support can use their grants to cover any charges, but the situation is more difficult for those who do not have such support. Since 1872, Sociedad Medica de Santiago-Chilean Society of Internal Medicine, owner and publisher of Revista Medica de Chile, has employed the ""subscribers pay"" model, subsidized by commercial advertising and temporary sponsors (Chilean government and others). The printed journal is reproduced in an open access electronic version, in www.scielo. cl. The increasing cost of both publications systems demands a time for reflection. (Rev Med Chile 2012; 140: 266-270)."
"Electronic commerce (e-commerce) has become a vital research area in the past few decades. Thousands of papers have been published in e-commerce journals and journals in related fields, such as information systems and marketing, influencing the direction and evolution of e-commerce research. The purpose of this paper is to examine how these journals are perceived by academic researchers in terms of their popularity and their contribution to the field of electronic commerce. An online survey was conducted to compare selected journals across four dimensions: popularity, relevance, academic contribution, and publication preference. The sample is comprised of a total of 162 responses from around the world. The journals are classified as either e-commerce or related fields based on their content, while e-commerce journals are further divided into comprehensive and niche journals based on their popularity. The findings indicate that scholars' perceptions of EC journals vary depending on region, age, and academic rank. Both the overall rankings and the regional rankings of these journals are reported."
"Interdisciplinarity is as trendy as it is difficult to define. Instead of trying to capture a multidimensional object with a single indicator, we propose six indicators, combining three different operationalizations of a discipline, two levels (article or laboratory) of integration of these disciplines and two measures of interdisciplinary diversity. This leads to a more meaningful characterization of the interdisciplinarity of laboratories' publication practices. Thanks to a statistical analysis of these indicators on 600 CNRS laboratories, we suggest that, besides an average value of interdisciplinarity, different laboratories can be mainly distinguished by the ""distance"" between the disciplines in which they publish and by the scale at which interdisciplinary integration is achieved (article or laboratory)."
"Usage data of scholarly articles provide a direct way to explore the usage preferences of users. Using the ""Usage Count"" provided by the Web of Science platform, we collect and analyze the usage data of five journals in the field of Information Science and Library Science, to investigate the usage patterns of scholarly articles on Web of Science. Our analysis finds that the distribution of usage fits a power law. And according to the time distribution of usage, researchers prefer to use more recent papers. As to those old papers, citations play an important role in determining the usage count. Highly cited old papers are more likely to be used even a long time after publication."
"This paper aims to present an alternative and simple method to improve the filtering of search results so as to increase the efficiency of literature searches, particularly for individual researchers who have limited logistical resources. The method proposed here is scope restriction using an impact-based filter, made possible by the emergence of freely available citation databases in conjunction with new tools to access and process the data efficiently. Results from a simulated search are compared between a conventional date-ranged filtered search and an impact-based filtered search using Publish or Perish as the citation analysis software. The utility and practical implications of this approach are further discussed."
"Background: Data reliability in original research requires collective trust from the academic community. Standards exist to ensure data integrity, but these safeguards are applied non-uniformly so errors or even fraud may still exist in the literature. Objective: To examine the prevalence and consequences of data errors, data reliability safeguards and fraudulent data among medical academics. Methodology: Corresponding authors of every fourth primary research paper published in the journal of the American Medical Association (2001-2003), Canadian Medical Association Journal (2001-2003). British Medical journal (1998-2000), and Lancet (1998-2000) were surveyed electronically. Questions focused on each author's personal experience with data reliability, data errors and data interpretation. Results: Sixty-five percent (127/195) of corresponding authors responded. Ninety-four percent of respondents accepted full responsibility for the integrity of the last manuscript on which they were listed as co-author; however, 21% had discovered incorrect data after publication in previous manuscripts they had co-authored. Fraudulent data was discovered by 4% of respondents in their previous work. Four percent also noted 'smudged' data. Eighty-seven percent of respondents used data reliability safeguards in their last published manuscript, typically data review by multiple authors or double data entry. Twenty-one percent were involved in a paper that was submitted despite disagreement about the interpretation of the results, although the disagreeing author commonly withdrew from authorship. Conclusions: Data reliability remains a difficult issue in medical literature. A significant proportion of respondents did not use data reliability safeguards. Research fraud does exist in academia; however, it was not reported to be highly prevalent. (C) 2009 European Federation of Internal Medicine. Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."
"In this study, we identified and analyzed characteristics of top-cited single-author articles published in the Science Citation Index Expanded from 1991 to 2010. A top-cited single-author article was defined as an article that had been cited at least 1000 times from the time of its publication to 2012. Results showed that 1760 top-cited single-author articles were published in 539 journals listed in 130 Web of Science categories between 1901 and 2010. The top productive journal was Science and the most productive category was multidisciplinary physics. Most of the articles were not published in high-impact journals. Harvard University led all other institutions in publishing top-cited single-author articles. Nobel Prize winners contributed 7.0% of articles. In total, 72 Nobel Prize winners published 124 single-author articles. Single-authored papers published in different periods exhibited different patterns of citation trends. However, top-cited articles consistently showed repetitive peaks regardless of the time period of publication. ""Theory (or theories)"" was the most frequently appeared title word of all time. Leading title words varied at different time periods, and only five title words, method(s), protein(s), structure(s), molecular, and quantum consistently remained in the top 20 in different time periods.

"Science studies have not yet provided a heuristic that distinguishes creative accomplishments from other research contributions. Likewise, there is no commonly agreed typology of creative scientific results. This article takes up these two desiderata. It is argued that scientific creativity springs from the fundamental tension between originality and scientific relevance. Based on this consideration, a heuristic is introduced that singles out creative research accomplishments from other contributions in science. Furthermore, it is shown that creative contributions are not only advances in theory, but also new methods, new empirical phenomena, and the development of new research instrumentation. The article introduces examples from science history and presents results from bibliometric studies."
We present a mathematical derivation of the scale-dependence of the h-index. This formula can be used in two cases: one where the units are scale-dependent and one where the units are not scale-dependent. Examples are given.
"Background: In recent years, China's healthcare reforms and related studies have drawn particular global attention. The main objective of this study is to evaluate quantitatively the publication trends and collaboration performance of China in healthcare science and services (HSS) research. Methods: Scientometric methods and visualization technology were used to survey the growth and development trends of HSS research based on the Web of Science publications during the past 15 years. Results: China's international publications on HSS research increased rapidly compared to those of the global HSS and Chinese scientific studies. Growth trends indicate that collaboration among countries, institutions and authors has also increased. China's leading partners were all developed countries, such as the US, the UK, Australia and Canada, which have contributed to the majority of the joint publications. The academic impact of publications involving partners from European and American countries was relatively higher than those involving partners from Asian countries. Prominent institutions were universities that could be primarily classified into two groups, namely, Mainland China on the one hand and Hong Kong universities and foreign universities on the other. The most prominent actors were elite institutions, such as Peking University, Fudan University, Chinese University of Hong Kong, University of Hong Kong. The papers published by the Chinese Ministry of Health had relatively high academic impact, whereas those published by Mainland China universities alone had a lower academic impact compared to foreign cooperation papers. Issues related to the Chinese healthcare reform, priority diseases (e.g., breast cancer, HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, etc.), health systems performance, quality of life and measurement tools, aging problems and research methods have been the most popular HSS topics in China in recent years. Conclusions: Despite the extensive achievement of the Chinese HSS reforms and research, gaps and challenges remain to be addressed, including those related to health insurance and the effects of the evaluation of essential medicine systems, human resources training and allocation in the health sector, government hospitals reforms and health services systems remodeling. These findings could help scholars and decision-makers understand the current status and likely future trends of the Chinese HSS research, and help them select the most appropriate collaboration partners and policies."
"In economics, the principal-agent problem is the difficulty in motivating one party (the agent), to act in the best interests of another (the principal) rather than in his own interests. We consider the example of a journal editor (the principal) wondering whether his or her reviewer (the agent) is recommending rejection of a manuscript because it does not have enough quality to be published or because the reviewer dislikes effort and he/she must work to acquire in-depth knowledge of the content of the manuscript. The reviewer's effort provides him or her with superior information about a manuscript's quality. If this information is not correctly communicated, the reviewer has more information when compared with the journal editor. This inherently leads to an encouragement of moral hazard, where the editor will not know whether the reviewer has done his or her job in accordance to the editor's interest. Prescriptions need to be given as to how the journal editor should control the reviewers to curb self-interest. Besides the associate editors monitoring the peer-review process, incentives can be employed to limit moral hazard on the part of the reviewer. Drawing on agency theory, we examine the incentives motivating the reviewers to expend effort to generate information about the quality of submissions. This model predicts that for reviewers early in their careers, promotion-based incentives may mean there is no need for within-job incentives, but also that within-job rewards for a referee's performance should depend on individual differences in ability and promotion opportunities."
"Background The amount of scientific literature available is often overwhelming, making it difficult for researchers to have a good overview of the literature and to see relations between different developments. Visualisation techniques based on bibliometric data are helpful in obtaining an overview of the literature on complex research topics, and have been applied here to the topic of patient safety (PS). Methods On the basis of title words and citation relations, publications in the period 2000-2010 related to PS were identified in the Scopus bibliographic database. A visualisation of the most frequently cited PS publications was produced based on direct and indirect citation relations between publications. Terms were extracted from titles and abstracts of the publications, and a visualisation of the most important terms was created. The main PS-related topics studied in the literature were identified using a technique for clustering publications and terms. Results A total of 8480 publications were identified, of which the 1462 most frequently cited ones were included in the visualisation. The publications were clustered into 19 clusters, which were grouped into three categories: (1) magnitude of PS problems (42% of all included publications); (2) PS risk factors (31%) and (3) implementation of solutions (19%). In the visualisation of PS-related terms, five clusters were identified: (1) medication; (2) measuring harm; (3) PS culture; (4) physician; (5) training, education and communication. Both analysis at publication and term level indicate an increasing focus on risk factors. Conclusions A bibliometric visualisation approach makes it possible to analyse large amounts of literature. This approach is very useful for improving one's understanding of a complex research topic such as PS and for suggesting new research directions or alternative research priorities. For PS research, the approach suggests that more research on implementing PS improvement initiatives might be needed."
"BACKGROUND: In this bibliometric study, we aimed to conduct multi-dimensional citation analysis of the top 100 cited articles in traumatology. METHODS: We analyzed the top 100 cited articles among 56.980 trauma articles published between 1975 and 2017, which we obtained from databases in Web of Science and PubMed based on their citation rates and publication years, countries of origin, institutions or organizations, the most common subjects, funding status, article types, and levels of evidence. RESULTS: In the top 100 cited articles, the number of total authors was 649 and average authorship was 6.49 +/- 5.46 (1-32); group author or study group number was eight, and the number of total collaborators was 1241. USA was the top country in terms of country of origin and institutions or organizations and also the number of proceedings papers in scientific activities. We found that 70 of the top 100 cited articles were supported by funding agencies in developed countries. In the present study, the three most common subjects were central nervous system trauma (21 articles), major trauma-hemorrhage-bleeding control-transfusion-early coagulopathy (18 articles), and trauma care and systems (eight articles), respectively. The average level of evidence of the top 100 cited articles was 2.45 +/- 1.05 (range: I -4). We also found that 66 of the 100 most frequently cited articles in traumatology were published in scientific journals that had an impact factor of >= 2.6 (range: 2.648-72.406). We found that the most commonly preferred article type by authors is clinical research (92 articles) and sub-type is prospective comparative studies (27 articles). Evidence groups of classical papers in traumatology were B (54 articles), A (26 articles), and C (20 articles), respectively. CONCLUSION: Despite some flaws in determining the scientific values of articles, citation analysis of classical papers in traumatology can provide important scientific contributions."
"Citation analysis of documents retrieved from the Medline database (at the Web of Knowledge) has been possible only on a case-by-case basis. A technique is presented here for citation analysis in batch mode using both Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) at the Web of Knowledge and the Science Citation Index at the Web of Science (WoS). This freeware routine is applied to the case of Brugada Syndrome, a specific disease and field of research (since 1992). The journals containing these publications, for example, are attributed to WoS categories other than cardiac and cardiovascular systems, perhaps because of the possibility of genetic testing for this syndrome in the clinic. With this routine, all the instruments available for citation analysis can now be used on the basis of MeSH terms. Other options for crossing between Medline, WoS, and Scopus are also reviewed."
"Authorship identity has long been an Achilles' heel in bibliometric analyses at the individual level. This problem appears in studies of scientists' productivity, inventor mobility and scientific collaboration. Using the concepts of cognitive maps from psychology and approximate structural equivalence from network analysis, we develop a novel algorithm for name disambiguation based on knowledge homogeneity scores. We test it on two cases, and the results show that this approach outperforms other common authorship identification methods with the ASE method providing a relatively simple algorithm that yields higher levels of accuracy with reasonable time demands."
"Here, the pattern of co-authorship among ecologists was evaluated using a network approach that was built using four time periods (1977-1986, 1987-1996, 1997-2006, and 2007-2016). Furthermore, four potential explanations (geographic distance, word similarity, reputation asymmetry, and country development) for this pattern were evaluated. Distance and reputation asymmetry effects on collaboration have decreased in recent decades, whereas word similarity was a good predictor in recent decades. Of interest, country development was not a good predictor of co-authorship among ecologists."
"Nowadays, conference publications have gained importance both quantitatively and qualitatively. People are seeking ways to distinguish the quality and impact of different conferences. Some bibliometrics like conference impact factor have been proposed to assess them. Meanwhile, associations in some countries have implemented several projects to build conference ranking systems that classify conferences based on certain quality measures. The Computing Research and Education Association of Australasia and China Computer Federation lists are two such well-known and widely used conference rating systems. They can serve as a guide when researchers need to publish their work. At the same time, they can influence researchers' publication decisions. In this paper, we try to find out how publication patterns in different countries have been influenced by these two lists as well as by some other factors. A random-effect Negative Binominal Regression Model is used to identify the level of the impact caused by different factors."
"Purpose This research aims to examine the intellectual structure of iMetrics through author co-citation analysis. Design/methodology/approach This research uses common techniques in bibliometrics and social network analysis. It analyses 5,944 records from the Web of Science in the field of iMetrics that are published between 1978 and 2014. Findings Findings indicated that researchers including Garfield, Egghe, Glanzel, Leydesdorff and Price have received many co-citations. The author co-citation analysis in iMetrics resulted in eight thematic clusters, including theoretical foundations and citation analysis, sociology of science, science mapping and visualization, network analysis, classic laws of bibliometrics, webometrics, technometrics and miscellaneous. Theoretical foundations and citation analysis is the biggest cluster which comprises 59 authors. The results suggest the crucial role of price medallists in shaping the intellectual structure of knowledge in iMetrics. Originality/value Extracting the patterns embedded in the knowledge structure of iMetrics studies provides beneficial information for both researchers and policymakers. This research study is valuable that used an appropriate set of records regarding both recall and precision. Furthermore, this study helps us better understand the characteristics of iMetrics, its subject areas, and the prominent authors in those areas."
"Canadian clinical psychology professors in programs accredited by the Canadian Psychological Association (CPA) are generally expected to perform in 3 major domains research, teaching, and service. Measurement of performance in these domains is complicated. Research productivity, as measured by publication and citation counts, are often touted as objective metrics for evaluating professorial research performance; however, such quantifications can be problematic. Despite concerns, evaluators continue to use publication and citation counts for evaluating psychology professors. Use of these metrics without normative data is extremely problematic; moreover, without ceiling reference points or identification of outliers, new professors and those evaluating them have no perspective on reasonable expectations. The current study provides normative data and ceiling reference points using publically available data for the 255 professors currently in CPA-accredited Canadian clinical psychology programs, as well as submissions from an invited subset of those same professors. The data were stratified by professorial rank and sex, with the men and women having the highest publication and citation counts identified to create ceiling references. The results suggest that most CPA-accredited Canadian clinical psychology professors publish between 0 and 4 articles annually. Men publish significantly more than women at the Assistant and Full professorial ranks (p < .05), but not at the Associate rank (p > .10). Evidence also suggests that professors cannot be appropriately rank-ordered based on any single research index. Comprehensive results, implications, limitations, contextually based caveats, and directions for future research are discussed."
"Biotechnology, ever since its inception has had a huge impact on the society and its various applications have been intricately woven into the human web of life. Its evolution amidst all the other research realms vital to mankind is remarkable. In this paper, we intend to identify the radical innovations in Biotechnology for Engineering using network analyses. Centrality analysis and Path analysis are used for identifying important works. Existence of Flow Vergence effect in the scientific literature is revealed. Flow Vergence gradient, an arc metric derived from FV model, is utilised for Path analysis which detects pivotal papers of paradigm shift more accurately. A major paradigm shift has been identified in the business models of Biotechnology for Engineering - 'Capability to Connectivity' model. Evidence towards the adoption of business practices in BT firms by nanotechnology start-ups is also identified. The notion of critical divergence is introduced and the exhibition of interdisciplinary interaction in emerging fields due to critical divergence is discussed. Implications of above analyses which target: (i) Science and technology policy makers, (ii) industrialists and investors, (iii) researchers in academia as well as industry, are also discussed.

"This paper analyses the evolution of Spanish communication research published as scientific articles between 1980 and 2010. It quantifies the volume of this production with two different samples: the first sample includes national journals and offers original and unprecedented data; the second one includes international journals, defined as those indexed by the Web of Science. As a whole, more than 6,000 articles were analysed. Additionally, the collaboration patterns in authorship and internationality were also studied. On the one hand, collaboration was measured through indicators of multiple authorship and the evolution of co-authorship indexes. On the other hand, internationality was measured through the share of Spanish authors in international journals, the weight of international collaborations and the language used in national journals. Data obtained illustrate a growth and maturity process of communication as a scientific discipline: at the end of the period analysed, a tension between growing collaboration and internationalization and traditional publication patterns was found. Through the period studied, the birth of new faculties with communication studies and the growing number of journals have feed the own growth of the number of articles. However, other elements such as scientific assessment have also played a role in the internationalization of authors. As a whole, this article offers a first image of the evolution of communication as an academic discipline in Spain."
"The starting point of this paper is a desktop research assessment model that does not take properly into account the complexities of research assessment, but rather bases itself on a series of highly simplifying, questionable assumptions related to the availability, validity and evaluative significance of research performance indicators, and to funding policy criteria. The paper presents a critique of this model, and proposes alternative assessment approaches, based on an explicit evaluative framework, focusing on preconditions to performance or communication effectiveness rather than on performance itself, combining metrics and expert knowledge and using metrics primarily to set minimum standards. Giving special attention to early career scientists in emerging research groups, the paper discusses the limits of classical bibliometric indicators and altmetrics. It proposes alternative funding formula of research institutions aimed to support emerging research groups."
"Objective: several studies have examined the academic production of the researchers at the CNPq, in several areas of knowledge. The aim of this study was to evaluate the scientific production of researchers in Hematology/Oncology who hold scientific productivity grants from the Brazilian Council for Scientific and Technological Development. Methods: the Academic CVs of 28 researchers in Hematology/Oncology with active grants in the three-year period from 2006 to 2008 were included in the analysis. The variables of interest were: institution, researchers' time after doctorate, tutoring of undergraduate students, masters and PhD degree, scientific production and its impact. Results: from a total of 411 researchers in Medicine, 28 (7%) were identified as being in the area of Hematology/Oncology. There was a slight predominance of males (53.6%) and grant holders in category 1. Three Brazilian states are responsible for approximately 90% of the researchers: sao Paulo (21,75%), Rio de Janeiro (3,11%), and Minas Gerais (2, 7%). During their academic careers, the researchers published 2,655 articles, with a median of 87 articles per researcher (IQR = 52 to 122). 65 and 78% of this total were indexed on the Web of Science and Scopus databases, respectively. The researchers received 14,247 citations on the WoS database with a median of 385 citations per researcher. The average number of citations per article was 8.2. Conclusion: in this investigation, it was noted that researchers in the field of Hematology/Oncology have a relevant scientific output from the point of view of quantity and quality compared to other medical specialties."
"Using citation analysis, this study identifies the most relevant journals in communication studies. The study analyzes citations from a representative list of 116 journals from subject areas within communication studies over a 30-year period and addresses research interests throughout the discipline. Results indicate that most journals cited in the literature were outside communication studies. This study provides an inclusive picture of where communication studies research is published by detailing the most-cited journals and provides evidence-based recommendations for collection management."
"The aim of peer review is to separate the wheat from the chaff for publication and research funding. In the excessive competition, this mechanism would only select the wheat of mainstream. Up to now, almost all discussions on the consequence of the short-comings of peer review are limited to qualitatively description. I propose a model of ""peer-group-assessed-grant-based-funding-system"" combined with tenure system and over-competitive research funding review process. It is the first on the quantitatively investigation which dramatizes the current short-comings of the process. My simulation shows that it takes about two or three generations of researchers for the mainstream of a complicated research topic obtaining monopoly supremacy, with only the aid of the mechanism the model described. Based on the computation results, suggestions are proposed to avoid loss of self-correction capability on popularity determined single research direction which could be wrong on very complicated research topics."
"We examine the research output from the Balkan Countries in the fields of physics and chemistry registered in the databases of Science Citation Index and SCOPUS for the years 1996-2010. Over the years, the relative contribution from the area has increased on average by approximately 50% and represents around 4% of the world overall production. However, the diversity of the Balkan region is also reflected in the performance of individual countries. Although each of them shows growth in the last decade in absolute terms, relative downturn is evident in several cases. Data are provided about cooperation among Balkan countries."
"This article documents the process and outcome of a collaborative project, conducted by librarians in the Triangle Research Libraries Network (TRLN), to develop a local cost-per-cited-reference (CPCR) metric to evaluate ejournal packages and to apply that metric to the evaluation of a consortial Big Deal. When considered with CPU and other germane factors, work done to calculate CPCR by TRLN librarians can help other libraries and consortia make data-driven decisions about continuing, breaking up, and/or entering into package deals. The authors will discuss the rationale behind harvesting citation data from Scopus versus Web of Science, the work involved in assembling the data set and calculating CPCR, the value of the data when making selection decisions, and the value of completing this work."
"We suggest a new approach for ranking Ukrainian scientific journals and proceedings. According to a number of criteria, all the journals specialized in the fields of natural sciences, engineering, veterinary and agriculture are divided into seven categories termed as A to G. The analysis of their Pareto distributions shows that, among the overall number of 819 items, 14 can be referred to the category A, 25 to the category B, 13 to the category C, 30 to the category D, and 11 to the category E. The remaining categories F and G contain respectively 641 and 85 items. Issuing from our analysis, we state that only the journals belonging to the categories A to E, with the total scores higher than or equal to 25, meet at least 87% of all the criteria."
"From an astronomical and relativistic point of view, the Great War began with the 1914 August capture and imprisonment of the members of a German eclipse expedition that had gone to the Crimea to look, at the request of Einstein, for bending of starlight by the Sun. And it ended in 1919 with the Eddington-inspired measurements of that light-bending from Principe and Sobral, and with the founding of the International. Astronomical Union by scientists from ""the countries at war with the Central Powers"". In between came unprecedented death and destruction. The scientists lost were mostly too young to have made an impact. Exceptions include Henry Moseley (shot at Gallipoli in 1915 August, before he had finished sorting out the periodic table by atomic numbers) and Karl Schwarzschild (invalided home from the Russian front with pemphigus, to die in 1916 May), but many of the best-known of the next generation had, if citizens of the belligerent countries, served on the battle lines, and most of the rest contributed in some other way. It may come as a surprise to find that both theoretical physics and observational astronomy of relevance to General Relativity continued to take place, and that there was a certain amount of communication of results, information, and even goods in both directions. The early postwar years saw something of a flowering of the subject, before the majority of physicists turned their attention to quantum mechanics and astronomers to stellar physics, though each had been under consideration during the war. Part I will take us up to Einstein's 1915-1916 papers. Part II looks at what others did during the Great War. And Part III addresses aspects of the aftermath, including Einstein's 1922 visit to France."
"Peer review is important in ensuring quality. As science and technology develops in China, the number of scientific papers is increasing, and it is interesting to discover whether there are differences between reviewers from China and those from other countries when they review manuscripts submitted by Chinese authors. This study was based on an environmental academic Chinese (English language) journal. The peer review of 157 manuscripts from Chinese authors was analyzed. There are significant differences in whether a potential reviewer accepts an invitation to review; however, the outcome of peer review is almost unaffected by the reviewer's geographical origin.

"Delayed open access (OA) refers to scholarly articles in subscription journals made available openly on the web directly through the publisher at the expiry of a set embargo period. Although a substantial number of journals have practiced delayed OA since they started publishing e-versions, empirical studies concerning OA have often overlooked this body of literature. This study provides comprehensive quantitative measurements by identifying delayed OA journals and collecting data concerning their publication volumes, embargo lengths, and citation rates. Altogether, 492 journals were identified, publishing a combined total of 111,312 articles in 2011; 77.8% of these articles were made OA within 12 months from publication, with 85.4% becoming available within 24 months. A journal impact factor analysis revealed that delayed OA journals have citation rates on average twice as high as those of closed subscription journals and three times as high as immediate OA journals. Overall, the results demonstrate that delayed OA journals constitute an important segment of the openly available scholarly journal literature, both by their sheer article volume and by including a substantial proportion of highimpact journals."
"Information Sciences is a leading international journal in computer science launched in 1968, so becoming fifty years old in 2018. In order to celebrate its anniversary, this study presents a bibliometric overview of the leading publication and citation trends occurring in the journal. The aim of the work is to identify the most relevant authors, institutions, countries, and analyze their evolution through time. The paper uses the Web of Science Core Collection in order to search for the bibliographic information. Our study also develops a graphical mapping of the bibliometric material by using the visualization of similarities (VOS) viewer. With this software, the work analyzes bibliographic coupling, citation and co-citation analysis, co-authorship, and co-occurrence of keywords. The results underline the significant growth of the journal through time and its international diversity having publications from countries all over the world. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

"The purpose of this study is to test for the presence of order-effect bias in journal ranking surveys. Data were obtained from 379 active knowledge management and intellectual capital researchers who rated 25 journals on a 7-point scale. Five different versions of the survey instrument were utilized. Consistent with the cognitive elaboration model, the satisficing theory, and the Gricean maxim of orderliness, order-effect bias was observed in journal ranking surveys. Journals that appear in the beginning of the ranking list delivered to survey respondents consistently receive higher scores than journals at the end of the list. Overall, the position of the journal in the list explains over 10% of its score. Therefore, authors of journal ranking studies are recommended to use multiple versions of the survey instrument with randomized journal orders. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."
"This study examines the effect of international collaboration of Slovenian authors and the status of journals where papers are published (as determined by their impact factors) on the impact of papers as measured by the number of citations papers receive. Research programme groups working in Slovenia in the 2004-2008 period in the fields of physics, chemistry, biology, biotechnology, and medical science were used for analyses. The results of the analyses show that the effects of the two factors differ among the fields. We discuss possible reasons for this, including the possibility that differences are the result of Slovenia's science policy."
"The Leiden methodology (LM), also sometimes called the ""crown indicator"", is a quantitative method for evaluating the research quality of a research group or academic department based on the citations received by the group in comparison to averages for the field. There have been a number of applications but these have mainly been in the hard sciences where the data on citations, provided by the ISI Web of Science (WoS), is more reliable. In the social sciences, including business and management, many journals and books are not included within WoS and so the LM has not been tested here. In this research study the LM has been applied on a dataset of over 3000 research publications from three UK business schools. The results show that the LM does indeed discriminate between the schools, and has a degree of concordance with other forms of evaluation, but that there are significant limitations and problems within this discipline.

"The academic world has come to place enormous weight on bibliometric measures to assess the value of scientific publications. Our paper has two major goals. First, we discuss the limits of numerical assessment tools as applied to computer science publications. Second, we give guidelines on how to write a good paper, where to submit the manuscript, and how to deal with the reviewing process. We report our experience as editors of International Journal of Computers Communications & Control (IJCCC). We analyze two important aspects of publishing: plagiarism and peer reviewing. As an example, we discuss the promotion assessment criteria used in the Romanian academic system. We express openly our concerns about how our work is evaluated, especially by the existent bibliometric products. Our conclusion is that we should combine bibliometric measures with human interpretation."
"Publication of original research, clinical experiences, and critical reviews of literature are vital to the growth of the genetic counseling field, delivery of genetic counseling services, and professional development of genetic counselors. Busy clinical schedules, lack of time and funding, and training that emphasizes clinical skills over research skills may make it difficult for new genetic counselors to turn their thesis projects into publications. This paper summarizes and elaborates upon a presentation aimed at de-mystifying the publishing process given at the 2008 National Society of Genetic Counselors Annual Education Conference. Specific topics include familiarizing prospective authors, particularly genetic counseling students, with the basics of the publication process and related ethical considerations. Former students' experiences with publishing master's theses also are described in hopes of encouraging new genetic counselors to submit for publication papers based on their thesis projects."
"The aim of this paper is to investigate the impact of internal and external research collaborations on the scientific performance of academic institutions. The data are derived from the international SCOPUS database. We consider both quantity (the number of publications) and quality indicators (the field-weighted citation impact and the share of publications in the 10% most-cited articles) to evaluate universities' performance in some European countries (Germany, France, Italy, the UK and Russia). To this end, we develop a non-overlapping generations model to evidence the theoretical idea of research externalities between academic institutions. Moreover, we implement an empirical model to determine the extent to which the impact of internal and external collaborations on universities' performance is sensitive to the geographical dimension of the data.

"Objective To describe h- and g-indices benchmarks in pediatric subspecialties and general academic pediatrics. Academic productivity is measured increasingly through bibliometrics that derive a statistical enumeration of academic output and impact. The h-and g-indices incorporate the number of publications and citations. Benchmarks for pediatrics have not been reported. Study design Thirty programs were selected randomly from pediatric residency programs accredited by the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education. The h- and g-indices of department chairs were calculated. For general academic pediatrics, pediatric gastroenterology, and pediatric nephrology, a random sample of 30 programs with fellowships were selected. Within each program, an MD faculty member from each academic rank was selected randomly. Google Scholar via Harzing's Publish or Perish was used to calculate the h-index, g-index, and total manuscripts. Only peer-reviewed and English language publications were included. For Chairs, calculations from Google Scholar were compared with Scopus. Results For all specialties, the mean h- and g-indices significantly increased with academic rank (all P < .05) with the greatest h-indices among Chairs. The h- and g-indices were not statistically different between specialty groups of the same rank; however, mean rank h-indices had large SDs. The h-index calculation using different bibliographic databases only differed by +/- 1. Conclusion Mean h-indices increased with academic rank and were not significantly different across the pediatric specialties. Benchmarks for h- and g-indices in pediatrics are provided and may be one measure of academic productivity and impact."
"In current science policies, competition and output incentives are emphasized as a means of making university systems efficient and productive. By comparing eight countries, this article analyzes how funding environments of university research vary across countries and whether more competitive funding systems are more efficient in producing scientific publications. The article shows that there are significant differences in the competitiveness of funding systems, but no straightforward connection between financial incentives and the efficiency of university systems exists. Our results provoke questions about whether financial incentives boost publication productivity, and whether policy-makers should place greater emphasis on other factors relevant to high productivity.

"The purpose of this study is to: (1) develop a ranking of peer-reviewed AI journals; (2) compare the consistency of journal rankings developed with two dominant ranking techniques, expert surveys and journal impact measures; and (3) investigate the consistency of journal ranking scores assigned by different categories of expert judges. The ranking was constructed based on the survey of 873 active AI researchers who ranked the overall quality of 182 peer-reviewed AI journals. It is concluded that expert surveys and citation impact journal ranking methods cannot be used as substitutes. Instead, they should be used as complementary approaches. The key problem of the expert survey ranking technique is that in their ranking decisions, respondents are strongly influenced by their current research interests. As a result, their scores merely reflect their present research preferences rather than an objective assessment of each journal's quality. In addition, the application of the expert survey method favors journals that publish more articles per year. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."
"In this article I investigate the shortcomings of exact string match-based author self-citation detection methods. The contributions of this study are twofold. First, I apply a fuzzy string matching algorithm for self-citation detection and benchmark this approach and other common methods of exclusively author name-based self-citation detection against a manually curated ground truth sample. Near full recall can be achieved with the proposed method while incurring only negligible precision loss. Second, I report some important observations from the results about the extent of latent self-citations and their characteristics and give an example of the effect of improved self-citation detection on the document level self-citation rate of real data."
"This paper investigates the citation impact of three large geographical areas - the U.S., the European Union (EU), and the rest of the world (RW) - at different aggregation levels. The difficulty is that 42% of the 3.6 million articles in our Thomson Scientific dataset are assigned to several sub-fields among a set of 219 Web of Science categories. We follow a multiplicative approach in which every article is wholly counted as many times as it appears at each aggregation level. We compute the crown indicator and the Mean Normalized Citation Score (MNCS) using for the first time sub-field normalization procedures for the multiplicative case. We also compute a third indicator that does not correct for differences in citation practices across sub-fields. It is found that: (1) No geographical area is systematically favored (or penalized) by any of the two normalized indicators. (2) According to the MNCS, only in six out of 80 disciplines - but in none of 20 fields - is the EU ahead of the U.S. In contrast, the normalized U.S./EU gap is greater than 20% in 44 disciplines, 13 fields, and for all sciences as a whole. The dominance of the EU over the RW is even greater. (3) The U. S. appears to devote relatively more - and the RW less - publication effort to sub-fields with a high mean citation rate, which explains why the U.S./EU and EU/RW gaps for all sciences as a whole increase by 4.5 and 5.6 percentage points in the un-normalized case. The results with a fractional approach are very similar indeed. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."
"This study proposes a method to automatically establish a narrow-sense knowledge structure for Chinese Library and Information Science (CLIS) using data from the Chinese Social Science Citation Index. The method applies multi-level clustering, using ontological ideas as theoretical guidance and ontology learning techniques as technical means. Knowledge categories generated are checked for cohesion and coupling through hierarchical clustering analysis and multidimensional scaling analysis in order to verify the accuracy and rationality of the narrow-sense knowledge structure of CLIS. Finally, the narrow-sense knowledge structure is expanded to a broad sense. Using scholars as objects in examples, this study discusses the semantic associations between topic knowledge and the other academic objects in CLIS from the micro-, meso-, and macro-levels, so as to fully explore the broad-sense knowledge structure of CLIS for knowledge analysis and applications."
"The Impact Factor had it's day. Altmetrics and the Future of Science Abstract: Altmetrics is a response to criticisms of the journal impact factor as a means in research evaluation. By extending the resonance spectrum from scientific sources covered by traditional bibliometries towards non-scientific sources, Altmetrics draws on user-generated data in the Social Web. Altmetrics suggest measuring the broader impacts of research by numbers. Triggered by the idea of a democratization of science, the implementation of Altmetrics is booming. Moreover, Altmetrics tools act as a catalyst of the digital shift towards Open Science. As a side-effect, however, the accompanied demand for popularity might superimpose epistemic criteria."
"Purpose: The increasing role of systematic reviews in knowledge production demands greater rigor in the literature search process. The performance of the Social Work Abstracts (SWA) database has been examined multiple times over the past three decades. The current study is a replication within this line of research. Method: Issue-level coverage was examined for the same 33 SWA core journals and the same time period as our 2009 study. Results: The mean percentage of issues missing in the current study was 20%. The mean percentage of issues missing in the current study was significantly greater than the mean percentage of issues missing in the 2009 study. Discussion: The research of other groups, and that of our own, has failed to prompt the National Association of Social Workers Press (NASW-P) to act. SWA was failing, it is failing, and NASW-P has failed to correct those failures."
"The purpose of this essay is to explore one particular aspect of a master's-level literature review: the literature search. Emphasis is placed on how librarians and libraries fit into the search process, particularly in the age of the Internet. The essay is intended less as a step-by-step ""how to"" than as a guide to conceptualizing the search process as a whole, particularly as that process plays out within the multidisciplinary field of Pacific Islands studies."
"International circumstances, Iran's special context and its legal system have often been blamed for the relative lack of attention on the part of Iranian scientists towards Intellectual Property Rights (IPR). In spite of these odds, however, the Iran Nanotechnology Initiative Council (INIC) launched a programme to overcome existing shortcomings and encourage nanotechnology researchers to protect their inventions in the country and particularly, overseas. The efficiency and effectiveness of this programme are analysed in this paper. In a country without a national IP policy, successful implementation of this programme could pave the way for extending the same mechanism to other technological fields, although it is unlikely that the deficiencies of Iran's national innovation system could be completely resolved by such sectoral policies."
"This study examines the educational value of 15,117 Spanish-language books published by Spanish publishers in social sciences and humanities fields in the period 2002-2011, based on mentions of them extracted automatically from online course syllabi. A method was developed to collect syllabus mentions and filter out false matches. Manual checks of the 52,716 syllabus mentions found estimated an accuracy of 99.5% for filtering out false mentions and 74.7% for identifying correct mentions. A fifth of the sampled books (2,849; 19%) were mentioned at least once in online syllabi and almost all (95%) were from a third of the publishers included in the study. An in-depth analysis of the 23 books recommended most often in online syllabi showed that they are mostly single-authored humanities monographs that were originally written in Spanish. The syllabus mentions originated from 379 domains, but mostly from Spanish university websites. In conclusion, it is possible to make indicators from online syllabus mentions to assess the teaching value of Spanish-language books, although manual checks are needed if the values are to be used for assessing individual books."
"Under the Excellence Initiative, a number of Clusters of Excellence in Germany have been supported since 2006 and 2007-including each a limited number of cooperating institutions. The aim of the present study is to investigate whether support for Clusters of Excellence since 2006 and 2007 is reflected in bibliometric network data. For this purpose, a comparison is made between network data in the period before support started (2003-2005) and in the period after support started (2009-2011). For these two periods, a co-authorship network is generated (based on the funded institutions). This is based on publications which are among the 1 % most frequently cited publications in their respective fields and publication year and which have at least one author from Germany. As the results show, the outcomes this yields for life sciences and natural sciences differ from each other. Whereas natural sciences display an effect of establishment of Clusters of Excellence on the bibliometric networks, this was not true of life sciences. After establishment of the Clusters of Excellence, the network in natural sciences not only contained more institutions of a Cluster of Excellence, but these institutions were distributed across fewer bibliometric clusters in the network than before establishment. In other words the structure of the Clusters of Excellence was better reflected in the network."
"Objective: To identify ""genuine"" publications from Turkey's institutions since 1992 that have cumulatively contributed the most to global cardiovascular medicine. Methods: Based on data from the Web of Science, 146 publications from Turkey were identified having received >= 50 citations as of late July, 2017. Papers with more than a minor share by international authors were excluded. Results: Hundred and ten primary authors generated 147 medical papers which received >= 50 (interquartile range, 54; 86) citations. These articles corresponded in quality to the top 12% global papers. Half of the articles were published from 2002 to late 2007, with a median exposure period of 12 years. Peak performance was reached in 2004-'07, with a mean of 15-20 papers annually, which then regressed to five papers in 2008-'13, representing an estimated 50% decline. Cardiology generated 105 articles (20 in collaboration with other branches), cardiovascular surgery generated 27 articles, and pediatric cardiology generated 5 articles. Publications arose from 26 medical faculties, Gulhane Military Academy, and 9 hospitals not which were not academically affiliated. The performance of many related Turkish institutions was disappointing. Conclusion: Turkey's contribution to cardiovascular medicine has further declined slightly in the current assessment, particularly since 2007. To prevent a further gap in Turkey's contribution to the field, an undelayed return is needed by building an environment that allows focusing on research with a potential to contribute to medicine."
"The article briefly presents and discusses 12 different approaches to the evaluation of information sources (for example a Wikipedia entry or a journal article): (1) the checklist approach; (2) classical peer review; (3) modified peer review; (4) evaluation based on examining the coverage of controversial views; (5) evidence-based evaluation; (6) comparative studies; (7) author credentials; (8) publisher reputation; (9) journal impact factor; (10) sponsoring: tracing the influence of economic, political, and ideological interests; (11) book reviews and book reviewing; and (12) broader criteria. Reading a text is often not a simple process. All the methods discussed here are steps on the way on learning how to read, understand, and criticize texts. According to hermeneutics it involves the subjectivity of the reader, and that subjectivity is influenced, more or less, by different theoretical perspectives. Good, scholarly reading is to be aware of different perspectives, and to situate oneself among them."
"This brief note discusses Garfield's continuing influence from the perspective of the Mendeley readers of his articles. This reflects the direct impact of his work since the launch of Mendeley in August 2008. In the last decade, his work is still extensively read by younger scientists, especially in computer and information sciences and the social sciences, and with a broad international spread. His work on citation indexes, impact factors and science history tracking seems to have the most contemporary relevance."
"In recent years a number of studies have focused on Argentina's 2001 economic crisis and its political, social, and institutional repercussions. To date, however, no studies have analyzed its effects upon the country's scientific system from a scientometric perspective, in terms of resources dedicated to scientific activity and the final output and impact. The present study does so by means of a set of scientometric indicators that reflect economic effort, human resources dedicated to research, publications, collaborative relations, and the international visibility of scientific contributions."
"A family of measures of a journal's impact is considered that takes account of the dispersion, as well as the mean, of the number of citations in a journal. These measures, called the Mean Dispersion Indices (MDI), generalize the stabilized-JIF recently introduced by Lando and Bertoli-Barsotti (J Informetr 11(3):689-703, 2017). The MDI use a geometric weighted average of the number of citations and the Gini coefficient to measure the dispersion of the number of citations. Journal rankings based on these measures are compared with those obtained from the Journal Impact Factor, the Scimago Journal Rank, the h-index measure, and the Eigenfactor rankings, four of the most well-known current impact measures. This comparison suggests that the different rankings may implicitly place different weights on dispersion and the average number of citations and some appear to show little correlation with dispersion."
"The plagiarism detection service CrossCheck has been used since October 2008 as part of the paper reviewing process for the Journal of Zhejiang University - Science (A & B). Between October 2008 and May 2009 662 papers were CrossChecked; 151 of these (around 22.8% of submitted papers) were found to contain apparently unreasonable levels of copying or self-plagiarism, and 25.8% of these cases (39 papers) gave rise to serious suspicions of plagiarism and copyright infringement. Four types of copying or plagiarism were identified, in an attempt to reach a consensus on this type of academic misconduct. (C) Zhang Yuehong 2010"
"Twitter text data may be very useful to evaluate from a different perspective financial tangibles, such as share prices, as well as intangible assets, such as company reputation. While twitter data are becoming widely available to researchers, methods aimed at selecting reliable twitter data are, to our knowledge, not yet available. To overcome this problem, and allow to employ twitter data for descriptive and predictive purposes, in this contribution we propose an effective statistical method that formalises and extends a quality index employed in the context of the evaluation of academic research, the h index, renamed T index. Our proposal will be tested on a list of twitterers described by the Financial Times as ""the top financial tweeters to follow"", for the year 2013. Using our methodology we rank these twitterers and provide confidence intervals to decide whether they are significantly different. Moreover through a sentiment analysis, we employ the twitters content to estimate graphical models useful in the context of financial systemic risk. To this aim we focus on the Italian bank system and we show how listed banks are connected on the basis of tweets data."
"The aim of the present study is to analyse the highly cited papers from India. The Science Citation Index Expanded database was used to retrieve the related bibliographic records. Grouping and reclassification of institutions with misspellings and variants have been done. The most productive institutions, collaborating partners and Y-index of the contributing authors were examined. Results revealed that all the highly cited papers from India did not receive citations in the early years after publication. Co-authored (or international collaboration) papers received more citation impact than single-authored ones. USA was the preferred collaborative partner for international collaboration. The Indian Institutes of Technology, CSIR organizations, and Indian Institute of Science, Bengaluru were the leading Indian institutions."
"Collaborations between China and the European Union (EU) member states involve not only connections between China and individual countries, but also interactions between the different EU member states, the latter of which is due also to the influence exerted by the EU's integration strategy. The complex linkages between China and the EU28, as well as among the 28 EU member states, are of great importance for studying knowledge flows. Using co-authorship analysis, this study explores the changes of the network structure between 2000 and 2014. Our results show that EU member states with middle- or low- scientific capacities, in particular those who joined the EU after 2000, have been actively reshaping the network of scientific collaborations with China. The linkages between middle- and low- scientific capacity countries have been tremendously strengthened in the later years. The network positional advantage (measured by the degree of betweenness centrality) has shifted from a few dominant nations to a wider range of countries. We also find that countries like Belgium, Sweden and Denmark are in important positions connecting the relatively low-capacity 'new' EU member states with China. The 'new' EU member states-that have relatively low scientific capacity-intend to cooperate with China jointly with 'old' EU member(s)."
"Relative Specialization Index (RSI) was introduced as a simple transformation of the Activity Index (AI), the aim of this transformation being standardization of AI, and therefore more straightforward interpretation. RSI is believed to have values between -1 and 1, with -1 meaning no activity of the country (institution) in a certain scientific field, and 1 meaning that the country is only active in the given field. While it is obvious from the definition of RSI that it can never be 1, it is less obvious, and essentially unknown, that its upper limit can be quite far from 1, depending on the scientific field. This is a consequence of the fact that AI has different upper limits for different scientific fields. This means that comparisons of RSIs, or AIs, across fields can be misleading. We therefore believe that RSI should not be used at all. We also show how an appropriate standardization of AI can be achieved. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."
"An effective bibliometric analysis based on the Science Citation Index (SCI) published by the Institute of Scientific Information (ISI) was carried out to identify wetland research between 1991 and 2008. The objective was to conduct a quantitative and qualitative analysis for global trends of wetland-related research. The characteristics related to publications were analyzed. The results showed the significant wetland research issues in the SCI database. From 1991 to 2008, the annual number of journal articles published and the number of articles cited to wetland research increased more than sixfold and ninefold respectively. The USA produced the most single-country articles and international collaborative articles, followed by Canada and UK. The results also showed the significant wetland research issues in SCI database. The most frequently used words were: ""water"" (or ""water quality""), which ranked 3rd, 7th, and 3rd according to the word in article title, author keyword, and keyword plus analysis, respectively. Constructed wetland biodiversity became more active in wetland research. The keywords ""constructed wetland"" and ""constructed wetlands"" ranked 58th and 12th in 1991-1996, while they ranked 5th and 4th in 2003-2008; the author keyword ""biodiversity"" ranked 45th in 1991-1996, while it ranked 23rd in 1997-2002, and 14th in 2003-2008; and keyword plus ""diversity"" ranked 93rd in 1991-1996, while it ranked 20th in 1997-2002, and 17th in 2003-2008. Moreover, it was proved that article title, author keyword, and keyword plus analysis methods were effective approaches for mapping wetland research. Popular wetland research issues and wetland research changes were also identified by statistical analysis. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."
"Introduction: The fate of manuscripts submitted and subsequently rejected by Spanish-language journals is unknown. The present study was designed to determine whether or not articles submitted to NEUROLOGIA are published following rejection, and if so, where. Methods: We searched Medline in late April 2012 and also analysed all manuscripts rejected by NEUROLOGIA between October 2004 and April 2012 according to that journal's two databases. In that period, 1277 articles were submitted to the journal. Results: Of the 271 manuscripts rejected by NEUROLOGIA, 54 articles (19.9%) were published in other journals. Neurology journals published 31 of the manuscripts (57.4%); 43 manuscripts (79.6%) appeared in Spanish-language journals. Of the rejected manuscripts, 24.1% of the originals, 8.3% of the letters to the editor, 28.9% of the case reports, 22.6% of the reviews and 6.3% of the images were published. Authors with three previously published articles on the same topic managed to publish their manuscripts in 34% of the cases, compared to only 11.8% of authors with fewer published articles (P < .0001). Of the total manuscripts rejected between 2004 and 2010, 24.8% were eventually published. The median time lapse between article submission and publication was 13 months (range, 2-59 months). Conclusion: Manuscripts rejected by NEUROLOGIA are often published in other journals, but this scenario is not as common as in English-language journals. In the case of NEUROLOGIA, the editor's decision to reject an article is more significant than it would be in an English-language journal because the author will have fewer additional possibilities of having the manuscript published.

"The purpose of this study was to investigate some of the concerns of Iranian special library managers regarding research and research competencies required by special librarians. In order to achieve the objectives of this study, 21 semi-structured interviews were conducted with Iranian special library managers. The results indicated that among the participants there was generally a positive view about research. However, some obstacles were encountered, such as lack of support from the administrators of the parent organization and a lack of competent librarians. The paper concludes with recommendations for expected research competencies for special librarians."
"The results of publication-based citation analyses for 28,383 English-language journal psychology publications from the German-speaking countries published between 1981 and 2010 are presented. Data for analyses stem from the Web of Science database, which covers nearly 90 % of such publications. The distribution of the frequency of citations by other authors is strongly skewed and shows that 20 % of the articles are never cited, 60 % are cited 1-22 times, and 20 % are cited more than 22 times. Age of publication and frequency of citations have significant, albeit numerically low, rank order correlations (Kendall's tau=.23). Therefore, the criteria of the number of citations by others per year since publication of the article is used to identify the 107 most frequently cited papers (TOP 107). The characteristics of these papers are described with reference to authorships and their internationality, the disciplines of psychology to which they belong, and to the study type (e. g., empirical vs. nonempirical). The limitations and possibilities of citation analyses are discussed with a preference for a rational integration of citation analyses into empirically supported peer review procedures."
"The ""ISI rankings of the spanish universities by scientific fields"" report is described, and some of the results are presented. One of the essential characteristics of this new ranking, based on Thomson-Reuters products, is its organization into 12 fields of knowledge. The IFQ2A-Index indicator was used to sort the universities, synthesizing information from 6 bibliometric indicators. The results section presents some total indicators for the Spanish university system, showing a steady growth of scientific production but almost no change in the visibility of the journals. Furthermore, a detailed analysis of the results shows the dominance of Catalan universities in the 12 fields of knowledge analyzed during the period 2005-2009."
"Osteoporosis is an important health problem with serious consequences. Evaluation of osteoporosis scientific output from Arab countries has not been explored and there are few internationally published reports on research activity about osteoporosis. The main objectives of this study were to analyze the research output originating from Arab countries and 3 Middle Eastern non-Arab countries, particularly Israel, Turkey and Iran in the field of osteoporosis. Original scientific articles or reviews published from the 21 Arab countries, Israel, Turkey and Iran about ""osteoporosis"" were screened using the ISI Web of Science database. The time frame for the result was up to year 2012. The total number of original and review research articles published globally about osteoporosis was 43,571. The leading country in osteoporosis research was United States of America (14,734; 33.82%). Worldwide, Turkey ranked 16th while Israel and Iran ranked 24th and 31st respectively. Among Arab countries, Egypt and Kingdom of Saudi Arabia came on positions 41 and 45 respectively. A total of 426 documents about ""osteoporosis"" were published from Arab countries which represents 0.98% of the global research output. Research about osteoporosis from Arab countries was very low until 2002 and then increased steadily. The total number of citations for osteoporosis documents from the Arab world was 5551 with an average citation of 13.03 per document and an h-index of 35. Thirty (7.04%) documents published from Arab countries about osteoporosis were published in Saudi Medical Journal. Egypt, with a total publication of 117 (27.47%) ranked first among the Arab countries in research about osteoporosis while American University in Beirut was the most productive institution with a total of 47 (11.03%) documents. Compared with other non-Arab countries in the Middle East, the research productivity from the Arab countries was lesser than that from Turkey and Israel but higher than that from Iran. The present data showed low research productivity in osteoporosis field in Arab countries. Research output can be improved by investing in more international and national collaborative research projects in the field of osteoporosis."
"Bibliometric rankings are quite common in the field of software engineering. For example, there are a series of ranking repeated every year which identify the top researchers and institutions at the international level in the field. There are also other studies to determine the most cited articles in software engineering journals, the most popular research topics in this area, or identify the top researchers and institutions in regional levels. However, there exists no existing bibliometric quantitative analysis of publications in the area of software engineering (SE), including relative and absolute growth in the number of all SE publications as well as an analysis among countries. This is the main goal and motivation of this article. Besides, this study intends to provide an overall quantitative trend of the software engineering papers, and compare that trend to research output in other areas of science. The bibliometric study reported in this paper is motivated by the fact that understanding the amount of geographical research contributions to the field of software engineering can help identify different countries' level of commitment to support research activities in this area over years. We analyze how the contribution levels of top-ranked countries have changed over the years and how SE compares to other disciplines of engineering and science. Among the most interesting findings of this study are: (1) Over 40 years, in total about 60% of the SE literature has been contributed by only 7% of all countries, (2) the SE research output of different countries does not necessarily correlate with their GDPs, (3) the share of contributions to the SE discipline by the American researchers has declined from 71.43% ( in 1980) to 14.90% ( in 2008), and ( 4) China is the country with the biggest share growth in the number of publications ( from 0.82% of the entire SE publications in 1991 to 13.82% in 2009)."
"In the literature produced about Lotka's law from 1922 to June 2010, the geometric distribution, truncated Poisson distribution, Poisson lognormal distribution, and the generalized inverse Gaussian Poisson distribution are studied to statistically model the number the authors who collaborate in the publication of an article. It was found that the Poisson lognormal distribution more closely estimated the total value of documents, followed by the truncated Poisson model, the geometric distribution, and finally the generalized inverse Gaussian Poisson distribution."
"There is a worldwide trend towards application of bibliometric research evaluation, in support of the needs of policy makers and research administrators. However the assumptions and limitations of bibliometric measurements suggest a probabilistic rather than the traditional deterministic approach to the assessment of research performance. The aim of this work is to propose a multivariate stochastic model for measuring the performance of individual scientists and to compare the results of its application with those arising from a deterministic approach. The dataset of the analysis covers the scientific production indexed in Web of Science for the 2006-2010 period, of over 900 Italian academic scientists working in two distinct fields of the life sciences."
"This paper presents the rationale, common practices, challenges, and some personal anecdotes from a journal editor on the production, use, and re-use of peer-reviewed scholarly articles as open educational resources (OER). The scholarly and professional discourse related to open educational resources has largely focused on open learning objects, courseware, and textbooks. However, especially in graduate education, articles published in scholarly journals are often a major component of the course content in formal education. In addition, open access journal articles are critical to expanding access to knowledge by scholars in the developing world and in fostering citizen science, by which everyone has access to the latest academic information and research results. In this article, I highlight some of the challenges, economic models, and evidence for quality of open access journal content and look at new affordances provided by the Net for enhanced functionality, access, and distribution. In the 17 years since I graduated with a doctorate degree, the climate and acceptance of open access publishing has almost reversed itself. I recall a conversation with my PhD supervisor in which he argued that publishing online was not a viable option as the product would not have permanency, scholarly recognition, or the prestige of a paper publication. His comments reflect the confusion between online resources and those described as open access, but as well illustrate the change in academic acceptance and use of open access products during the past decade. The evolution from paper to online production and consumption is a disruptive technology in which much lower cost and increased accessibility of online work opens the product to a completely new group of potential users. In the case of OER these consumers are primarily students, but certainly access to scholars from all parts of the globe and the availability to support citizen science (Silvertown, 2009) should not be underestimated."
"Today we have an incomplete picture of how much the world is spending on health and disease-related research and development (R&D). As such it is difficult to align, or even begin to coordinate, health R& D investments with international public health priorities. Current efforts to track and map global health research investments are complex, resource-intensive, and caveat-laden. An ideal situation would be for all research funding to be classified using a set of common standards and definitions. However, the adoption of such a standard by everyone is not a realistic, pragmatic or even necessary goal. It is time for new thinking informed by the innovations in automated online translation - e.g. Yahoo's Babel Fish. We propose a feasibility study to develop a system that can translate and map the diverse research classification systems into a common standard, allowing the targeting of scarce research investments to where they are needed most."
"In this contribution, which builds on and develops a study that was published more than 10 years ago, we address the role of the Chinese Key Labs (KLs) in the international and national scientific arena. We give a short overview of the position of KLs in China, including their budget and manpower. Based on large numbers of Chinese publications obtained from the Web of Science (WoS) and the Chinese Science Citation Database (CSCD), the KLs are compared across publication years to the rest of China (ChRest) with respect to publication output and citation impact. We also look at collaboration in terms of co-publishing between the KLs and the ChRest. As to publications in the WoS, we found that the contribution of KLs compared with the ChRest is slightly and irregularly increasing (using full counting as well as fractional counting), whereas a stronger increasing trend is observed for the corresponding contribution in the CSCD. We observed an increase in the number of collaborations between KLs and Chinese colleagues, regardless of database. For WoS and field normalized citation indicators, we obtained the expected results that researchers at KLs perform considerably better than other Chinese colleagues and, moreover, perform clearly better than database average. As such we may conclude that KLs have lived up to their promise and made real impact on the international arena."
"Rankings of scholarly journals based on citation data are often met with scepticism by the scientific community. Part of the scepticism is due to disparity between the common perception of journals' prestige and their ranking based on citation counts. A more serious concern is the inappropriate use of journal rankings to evaluate the scientific influence of researchers. The paper focuses on analysis of the table of cross-citations among a selection of statistics journals. Data are collected from theWeb of Science database published by Thomson Reuters. Our results suggest that modelling the exchange of citations between journals is useful to highlight the most prestigious journals, but also that journal citation data are characterized by considerable heterogeneity, which needs to be properly summarized. Inferential conclusions require care to avoid potential overinterpretation of insignificant differences between journal ratings. Comparison with published ratings of institutions from the UK's research assessment exercise shows strong correlation at aggregate level between assessed research quality and journal citation 'export scores' within the discipline of statistics."
"Organizations are being demanded to maintain the best Competitive Intelligence (CI) practices due to modern times. CI is the activity that aims obtaining, analysing and disseminating information in order to help decision-making processes. The present research was conducted to view the scenario of scientific production on Competitive Intelligence at the School of Information Science (FCI) of Brasilia University (UnB). FCI offers the undergraduate courses in Archive Science, Librarianship, Museology, in addition to the Graduate Program in Information Science, which offers Master and Doctorate degrees. The research is characterized as descriptive and the scientific production survey was accomplished using the bibliometric method. This makes use of quantitative techniques to measure production and dissemination of scientific knowledge. Data were collected by means of a form through the UnB Institutional Repository, using the keyword ""Competitive Intelligence"". A total of 350 documents produced by the School of Information Science were were recovered, in the institutional repository, from which 37 were about Competitive Intelligence: 17 were articles published in academic periodic journals; four were papers presented and published in conference proceedings; 10 were dissertations, and six were theses. This production shows that FCI has been producing knowledge on IC, a developing area on its way to consolidation in Brazil, and publishing the results."
"Even with very well-documented rankings of universities, it is difficult for an individual university to reconstruct its position in the ranking. What is the reason behind whether a university places higher or lower in the ranking? Taking the example of ETH Zurich, the aim of this communication is to reconstruct how the high position of ETHZ (in Europe rank no. 1 in PP[top 10%]) in the Centre for Science and Technology Studies (CWTS) Leiden Ranking 2013 in the field social sciences, arts and humanities came about. According to our analyses, the bibliometric indicator values of a university depend very strongly on weights that result in differing estimates of both the total number of a university's publications and the number of publications with a citation impact in the 90th percentile, or PP(top 10%). In addition, we examine the effect of weights at the level of individual publications. Based on the results, we offer recommendations for improving the Leiden Ranking (for example, publication of sample calculations to increase transparency)."
"Cameroon is one of the six countries of Central Africa with more than 20 000 000 residents. To characterize the Cameroon research performance, Cameroonians publications in the Science Citation Index Expanded during the period of 1936-2015, indexed in the Thomson Reuters SCI- EXPANDED database, were studied in this work. All documents of that period with Cameroon in the address field were included in the study. The document type, language, trend and collaborations were analyzed, as well as the output of different subject categories. Performances of countries, institutions and authors, including total, single, collaborative, first author, and corresponding author publications were also analyzed. Articles were analyzed by the scientific output and research performances of individuals, institutions and collaborative countries with Cameroon. Analyses included 8 457 articles (85 % of 10 591 Cameroonian publications). These bibliometric analyses of Cameroonian publications provided interesting insights concerning authors, institutions and collaboration patterns. Results showed that research in Cameroon was highly dependent on foreign collaborations, and the international collaboration was responsible for the increasing number of publications over the years. It was found that the articles with either first authors or corresponding authors from outside Cameroon got more citations than the others, and that the articles without any international collaboration had lower citations. The number of articles indexed by SCI-EXPANDED has seen an increase in terms of Cameroonian articles that is considerably greater that the increase in number of all articles in SCI- EXPANDED. Articles were more frequent than other types of publication and they were mostly in English. The University of Yaounde I ranked top one in inter-institutionally collaborative articles, the rank of the total inter-institutionally collaborative articles, and the rank of first author articles and corresponding author articles. The University of Yaounde I also was in an absolute leading position from 1970s to 2015, followed far away by the other institutions. The categories of tropical medicine, plant sciences, environmental and occupational public health, and infectious diseases, represented the largest number of published articles. Even though physics and chemistry dominated the ranking of the top 20 best Cameroonian authors, an independent mathematics article was the most cited, with 60 citations in 2015 to a Cameroonian author. The top three productive researchers were T.C. Kofane, B.T. Ngadjui, P. Woafo, all from University of Yaounde I. France and the USA dominated the ranking of countries with strong scientific collaboration with Cameroon."
"This paper introduces a new impact indicator for the research effort of a university, (n)h(3). The number of documents or the number of citations obtained by an institution are used frequently in international ranking of institutions. However, these are very dependent on the size and this is inducing mergers with the apparent sole goal of improving the research ranking. The alternative is to use the ratio of the two measures, the mean citation rate, that is size independent but it has been shown to fluctuate along the time as a consequence of its dependence on a very small number of documents with an extremely good citation performance. In the last few years, the popularity of the Hirsch index as an indicator of the research performance of individual researchers led to its application to journals and institutions. However, the original aim of this h index of giving a mixed measure of the number of documents published and their impact as measured by the citations collected along the time is totally undesirable for institutions as the overall size may be considered irrelevant for the impact evaluation of research. Furthermore, the h index when applied to institutions tends to retain a very small number of documents making all other research production irrelevant for this indicator. The (n)h(3) index proposed here is designed to measure solely the impact of research in a way that is independent of the size of the institution and is made relatively stable by making a 20-year estimate of the citations of the documents produced in a single year.

"University rankings are typically presenting their results as league tables with more emphasis on final scores and positions, than on the clarification of why the universities are ranked as they are. Finding out the latter is often not possible, because final scores are based on weighted indicators where raw data and the processing of these are not publically available. In this study we use a sample of Scandinavian universities, explaining what is causing differences between them in the two most influential university rankings: Times Higher Education and the Shanghai-ranking. The results show that differences may be attributed to both small variations on what we believe are not important indicators, as well as substantial variations on what we believe are important indicators. The overall aim of this paper is to provide a methodology that can be used in understanding universities' different ranks in global university rankings."
"This paper aims to determine the existence of differential characteristics between monographic special issues and regular non-monographic issues published by psychology journals according to different bibliometric indicators. The materials studied consisted of a total of 1120 articles published in 10 Ibero-American psychology journals included in the JCRs from 2013 to 2015. The number of monographic articles was 286 and the non-monographic works were 834. The results indicate that the articles published in monographic special issue journal receive a higher number of citations and that their publication times are shorter. A greater presence of journal committee members as authors of the papers in monographic special issues was also observed, and the number of authors per paper was lower compared to articles published in non-monographs. As a conclusion, publishing papers in monographic special issues versus non-monographic in the reviewed journals has some advantages for both journals and authors, such as greater international visibility and shorter publication times."
"The purpose of this research was to perform a bibliometric analysis of research journals containing scientific articles on the sport of rugby from 1922 to 2009. In this field 2057 articles were selected from major databases. The journals, authors and contents published were selected by taking into account the year of publication, thematic areas and modalities of rugby among other variables. A steady increase in production was found in the period considered, with a maximum of 174 articles published in 2007. The articles were written by an average of 2.5 authors and most of them (80.9%) only participated in one. The data showed a utility loss of 7.5% of the total items each year. The thematic areas and most influential journals on rugby had been identified. Finally, limited support has been found for attempting to adjust the bibliometric data by applying the laws of Lotka and Price with respect to the authors, and Bradford's law regarding scientific journals."
The authors update prior analyses of the undergraduate origins of individuals who earn a PhD in economics in the United States. They include the list of the top institutions worldwide graduating the largest number of undergraduates who subsequently earn an economics PhD from a U.S. university and lists of American institutions with the largest proportion of their total undergraduates and the largest proportion of their economics undergraduates who go on to earn an economics PhD from a U.S. university. They evaluate the success of graduates from various types of undergraduate institutions in terms of the probability of getting into top-15 economics PhD programs and for time-to-degree and success in completing PhD programs.
"There is no agreement over which statistical distribution is most appropriate for modelling citation count data. This is important because if one distribution is accepted then the relative merits of different citation-based indicators, such as percentiles, arithmetic means and geometric means, can be more fully assessed. In response, this article investigates the plausibility of the discretised lognormal and hooked power law distributions for modelling the full range of citation counts, with an offset of 1. The citation counts from 23 Scopus subcategories were fitted to hooked power law and discretised lognormal distributions but both distributions failed a Kolmogorov-Smirnov goodness of fit test in over three quarters of cases. The discretised lognormal distribution also seems to have the wrong shape for citation distributions, with too few zeros and not enough medium values for all subjects. The cause of poor fits could be the impurity of the subject subcategories or the presence of interdisciplinary research. Although it is possible to test for subject subcategory purity indirectly through a goodness of fit test in theory with large enough sample sizes, it is probably not possible in practice. Hence it seems difficult to get conclusive evidence about the theoretically most appropriate statistical distribution. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."
"Scientific production has increased exponentially in recent years. It is necessary to find methodological strategies for understanding holistic or macro views of the major research trends developed in specific fields. Data mining is a useful technique to address this task. In particular, our study presents a global analysis of the information generated during last decades in the Sport Sciences Category (SSC) included in the Web of Science database. An analysis of the frequency of appearance and the dynamics of the Author Keywords (AKs) has been made for the last thirty years. Likewise, the network of co-occurrences established between words and the survival time of new words that have appeared since 2001 has also been analysed. One of the main findings of our research is the identification of six large thematic clusters in the SSC. There are also two major terms that coexist ('REHABILITATION' and 'EXERCISE') and show a high frequency of appearance, as well as a key behaviour in the calculated co-occurrence networks. Another significant finding is that AKs are mostly accepted in the SSC since there has been high percentage of new terms during 2001-2006, although they have a low survival period. These results support a multidisciplinary perspective within the Sport Sciences field of study and a colonization of the field by rehabilitation according to our AK analysis."
"The new technology (such as ScholarOne) used for submitting papers to academic journals (such as this one) increases the possibilities for gathering, analysing and presenting summary data on stages in the refereeing process. Such data can be used to clarify the roles played by editors and publishers as well as refereesroles less widely discussed in the previous literature. I conclude, after a review of related issues, that refereeing should be open in this information agei.e. correspondence between editors, referees and authors should be open and available, and not private. Some of the issues involved in achieving this are outlined and discussed."
"For the first time in the history of psychology the pedagogical collective is viewed not only as the subject of educational activity, but also as the subject of its own development. The authors suggest a conception of preparedness of a pedagogical collective for being the subject of its own development and for being the subject of innovational activity, providing criteria and indices, identifying factors that determine differences between pedagogical collectives in the ability to carry out effective innovational activity. There is a close connection between preparedness of a collective for being the subject of its development, potential for involving teachers in management of innovational activity and effectiveness of the activity."
"I explored the use of astronomical monographs used for research. After scanning 135 monographs (excluding conference proceedings and textbooks) listed in 2000-2003 issues of Physics Today and counting citations of them in 2000-2013 in ADS (Astrophysics Data System), I found that 67% of the monographs received fewer than 2 citations per year. The average Citation rate for the 135 monographs is statistically the same as for ApJ papers. In contrast, only 41% of the ApJ papers produce fewer than 2 citations per year. ADS also counts the number of times each book or paper is read on-line. The average in 14 years is 181 +/- 27 times for the monographs and 633 +/- 47 times for ApJ papers. The total numbers of citations in 14 years for the monographs ranged from 0 to 711. I explored reasons for this range and only learned that it did not depend on (1) the numbers of book reviews published or (2) the scientific stature of the authors. I am unable to predict whether a monograph will be successful or not. The decreasing of references to monographs seems to be due to (1) monographs becoming so expensive that individuals and libraries cannot afford many of them, (2) readers seeming to prefer concise reviews, such as online searches and the Annual Reviews, and (3) most of the monographs having not been available free online."
Many countries are investing a lot in innovation in order to modernize their economies. A key step in this process is the development of academic research in innovation. This article analyzes the leading countries in innovation research between 1989 and 2013 from an academic perspective. The aim of the study is to identify the most relevant countries in this field and the leading trends that are occurring during the last years. The work also introduces a general perspective analyzing the research developed in several supranational regions. The main advantage of this contribution is that it gives a global overview of the current academic state of the art in the area. The analysis focuses on the most productive and influential countries in innovation research classifying the results in periods of 5 years. The leading journals in the field are also studied individually identifying the most productive countries in each of the journals. The results show that the publications of each country are biased by the country origin of the journal. The USA and the UK are the leading countries in this field being the UK the most productive one in per capita terms among the big countries.
"Bibliometrics has become an indispensable tool in the evaluation of institutions (in the natural and life sciences). An evaluation report without bibliometric data has become a rarity. However, evaluations are often required to measure the citation impact of publications in very recent years in particular. As a citation analysis is only meaningful for publications for which a citation window of at least three years is guaranteed, very recent years cannot (should not) be included in the analysis. This study presents various options for dealing with this problem in statistical analysis. The publications from two universities from 2000 to 2011 are used as a sample dataset (n = 2652, univ 1 = 1484 and univ 2 = 1168). One option is to show the citation impact data (percentiles) in a graphic and to use a line for percentiles regressed on 'distant' publication years (with confidence interval) showing the trend for the 'very recent' publication years. Another way of dealing with the problem is to work with the concept of samples and populations. The third option (very related to the second) is the application of the counterfactual concept of causality. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."
"This paper analyses the impact of blogs on the Hispanic literary field, and how the spreading of blogs concerned with literary critics and poetry is questioning traditional hierarchies. It looks at how literary reviews and critics on the Internet are superseding traditional criticism, which has been accused of an excessive interdependence between publishers, newspapers, poets, and critics. It will be argued that, in this competition between paper and Internet media, the former often functions as a conservative academic bastion whose prestige is being constantly contested. In addition, attention will be paid to websites like Las afinidades electivas, defined as 'an attempt for virtual interconnection between contemporary Spanish poets', social networks which recently have influenced other collective initiatives. In all these cases, the focus will be on the formal and thematic challenges which this new medium of diffusion offers for the development of a new literature."
"The globalization of science is demonstrated in the mobility of scientists across national boundaries, the composition of the U.S. scientific workforce, and increased collaboration across national boundaries. While studies based on bibliometric and other data have been useful in identifying trends, collaborative clusters, and other patterns in international collaboration, they do not reveal the social dynamics behind those collaborations. This paper addresses the human and social capital factors that explain whether or not an academic researcher in science and engineering has an international collaborator. Further, through detailed statistical models, the analysis also addresses the factors that differentiate the specific resources derived from those international ties. Results show that non-U.S. citizens are more likely to have close international collaborators, but that a range of factors explain this relationship. Further, results show that U.S. academic faculty mobilize different collaborative resources from international collaborators, versus their domestic collaborators."
"The degree to which scholarly journal articles published in subscription-based journals could be provided open access (OA) through publisher-permitted uploading to freely accessible web locations, so called green OA, is an underexplored area of research. This study combines article volume data originating from the Scopus bibliographic database with manually coded publisher policies of the 100 largest journal publishers measured by article output volume for the year 2010. Of the 1.1 million articles included in the analysis, 80.4 % could be uploaded either as an accepted manuscript or publisher version to an institutional or subject repository after one year of publication. Publishers were found to be substantially more permissive with allowing accepted manuscripts on personal webpages (78.1 % of articles) or in institutional repositories (79.9 %) compared to subject repositories (32.8 %). With previous studies suggesting realized green OA to be around 12 % of total annual articles the results highlight the substantial unused potential for green OA."
"In this paper, we use bibliometric methods and social network analysis to analyze the pattern of China-US scientific collaboration on individual level in nanotechnology. Results show that Chinese-American scientists have been playing an important role in China-US scientific collaboration. We find that China-US collaboration in nanotechnology mainly occurs between Chinese and Chinese-American scientists. In the co-authorship network, Chinese-American scientists tend to have higher betweenness centrality. Moreover, the series of polices implemented by the Chinese government to recruit oversea experts seems to contribute a lot to China-US scientific collaboration."
"Scientific literature ranking is essential to help researchers find valuable publications from a large literature collection. Recently, with the prevalence of webpage ranking algorithms such as PageRank and HITS, graph-based algorithms have been widely used to iteratively rank papers and researchers through the networks formed by citation and coauthor relationships. However, existing graph-based ranking algorithms mostly focus on ranking the current importance of literature. For researchers who enter an emerging research area, they might be more interested in new papers and young researchers that are likely to become influential in the future, since such papers and researchers are more helpful in letting them quickly catch up on the most recent advances and find valuable research directions. Meanwhile, although some works have been proposed to rank the prestige of a certain type of objects with the help of multiple networks formed of multiobjects, there still lacks a unified framework to rank multiple types of objects in the bibliographic network simultaneously. In this article, we propose a unified ranking framework MRCoRank to corank the future popularity of four types of objects: papers, authors, terms, and venues through mutual reinforcement. Specifically, because the citation data of new publications are sparse and not efficient to characterize their innovativeness, we make the first attempt to extract the text features to help characterize innovative papers and authors. With the observation that the current trend is more indicative of the future trend of citation and coauthor relationships, we then construct time-aware weighted graphs to quantify the importance of links established at different times on both citation and coauthor graphs. By leveraging both the constructed text features and time-aware graphs, we finally fuse the rich information in amutual reinforcement ranking framework to rank the future importance of multiobjects simultaneously. We evaluate the proposed model through extensive experiments on the ArnetMiner dataset containing more than 1,500,000 papers. Experimental results verify the effectiveness of MRCoRank in coranking the future influence of multiobjects in a bibliographic network."
"In the scientific community, a scientist's productivity is usually measured by his scientific output. The productivity of a group, an institution or, on a larger scale, a country can be assessed in similar manner. This study aims to show the contribution of Chinese authors to orthopedics research, from three major regions, namely Mainland China, Taiwan, and Hong Kong. Articles published in 63 orthopedics journals originating from Mainland China, Taiwan, and Hong Kong from 2003 to 2012 were retrieved from the PubMed database and Journal Citation Report. Quantitative and qualitative analyses were conducted for the total number of articles, clinical trials, randomized controlled trails, case reports, impact factors (IF), citations, and articles published in high-impact journals. There were totally 3473 articles from Mainland China (1859), Taiwan (1111), and Hong Kong (503) from 2003 to 2012, showing gradual increase from 2003 to 2012. From 2006 onward, the number of published articles from Mainland China exceeded that from Hong Kong and exceeded that from Taiwan in 2008. The accumulated IF of articles from Mainland China (3746.21) was higher than that from Taiwan (2466.74) and that from Hong Kong (1089.35). However, Taiwan witnessed the highest mean IF (2.22), followed by Hong Kong (2.17), and Mainland China (2.02). Hong Kong displayed the highest mean citations of each article (9.35), followed by Taiwan (9.12), and Mainland China (5.71). By contract, Spine was the most popular journal to choose in these three regions. The total number of orthopedics articles in China increased markedly from 2003 to 2012. Of the three regions, Mainland China published the most articles, clinical trials, randomized controlled trails, and case reports. In general, Spine was the most popular journal to choose in the three regions."
"A scientific co-authorship network may be modeled by a graph G composed of k nodes and m edges. Researchers that make up this network may be interpreted as its nodes and the link between these agents (co-authored papers) as its edges. Current work evaluated and compared the reliability measure of networks with two emphases: 1) On nodes (perfectly reliable edges) and 2) On edges (perfectly reliable nodes). Specifically, the reliability of a fictitious co-authorship network at a given time t was analyzed taking into account, first, the reliability of nodes (researchers) equal and different, and, second, the reliability of edges (co-authorship relations), equal and different. Additionally, centrality measures of nodes were obtained to identify situations where the insertion of an edge significantly increased the reliability of the network. Results showed that the reliability of the co-authorship network focusing on edges is more sensitive to changes in individual reliabilities than the reliability of the network focusing on nodes. Additionally, the use of centrality measures was viable to identify possible insertions of edges or co-authorship relations to increase the reliability of the network in the two approaches."
"Purpose - The purpose of this paper is twofold, first, to discuss the current and future issues around post-publication open peer review. Second, to highlight some of the main protagonists and platforms that encourages open peer review, pre- and post-publication. Design/methodology/approach - The first part of the paper aims to discuss the facilitators and barriers that will enable and prevent academics engaging with the new and established platforms of scholarly communication and review. These issues are covered with the intention of proposing further dialogue within the academic community that ultimately address researchers' concerns, whilst continuing to nurture a progressive approach to scholarly communication and review. The paper will continue to look at the prominent open post-publication platforms and tools and discuss whether in the future it will become a standard model. Findings - The paper identifies several problems, not exclusive to open peer review that could inhibit academics from being open with their reviews and comments of other's research. Whilst identifies opportunities to be had by embracing a new era of academic openness. Practical implications - The paper summarises key platforms and arguments for open peer review and will be of interest to researchers in different disciplines as well as the wider academic community wanting to know more about scholarly communications and measurement. Originality/value - This paper looks at many of the new platforms that have been previously ignored and discusses issues relating to open peer review that have only been touched on in brief by other published research."
"An innovative approach is proposed for a rating system for academic publications based on a categorization into ratings comparable to financial ratings such as Moody's and S&P ratings (AAA, AA, A, BA, BBB, BB, B, C). The categorization makes use of a variable percentile approach based on recently developed h-related indices. Building on this categorization, a new index is proposed for researchers, the fame-index or f(2)-index. This new index integrates some qualitative elements related to the influence of a researcher's articles. It better mitigates than the classic h-index."
"A bibliometric analysis was conducted to evaluate the global scientific output of proteomics research in the Science Citation Index Expanded from 1995 to 2010. The document types, languages, journals, categories, countries, and institutions were analyzed to obtain publication patterns. Research focuses and trends were revealed by a word cluster method related to author keywords, title, abstract, and KeyWords Plus. Bradford's Law and the correlation between keywords and institutions were identified to look deeper into the nature works. Proteomics and Journal of Proteome Research published the most articles in proteomics research. The researchers focused on the categories of biochemical research methods, and biochemistry and molecular biology. The USA and Harvard University were the most productive country and institution, respectively, while China was the fastest-growing country due to the support by Chinese government. The distribution of author keywords provided the important clues of hot issues. Results showed that mass spectrometry and two-dimensional gel electrophoresis had been the most frequently used research methods in the past 16 years; and cancer proteomics had a strong potential in the near future. Furthermore, biologists contributed significantly to proteomics research, and were more likely to co-operate with medical scientists."
"Objective: To give an overview of the behaviour and scientific contributions of the Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery American (JBJS-A) and British Volume (JBJS-B). Methods: 480 original articles published in 2009 were identified through a combined comprehensive computer and manual library search. Articles were assigned to 11 orthopaedic categories and by country, type and specialty of the institution. Possible grants and citations were analysed. USA led all countries in published articles (36,87%), followed by UK (20,62%) and South Korea (5,83%). Most studies published were performed at academic institutions (65,83 %), only 4,16% at private practices. Results: Almost half of the articles (46,24%) were published in three categories: hip (19.16%), knee (13.75%) and trauma (13.33%). In both journals 47.15% articles had at least one funding source. A review of articles published in major journals allows to show how research in orthopaedics is distributed worldwide. Conclusion: This study shows that a variety of different journals is neccessary to reflect the broad spectrum of orthopaedics in depth. Level of Evidence III, Retrospective Comparative Study."
"The family of indicators presented in this paper includes indices created by taking into account not only the direct but also the indirect impact of citations and references. Three types of citation graphs are presented, namely, the Paper-Citation graph, the Author-Citation graph and the Journal-Citation graph, along with different methods for constructing them. In addition, the concept of generations of citations is examined in detail, again by presenting various methods for defining them found in the literature. Finally, a number of indirect indicators for papers, authors and journals are discussed, which among others, include PageRank, CiteRank, indirect h-index and the EigenFactor score."
"This article reviews ways that commissioning editors in academic book publishing can better understand the end-users of their products. It discusses available market resources, reports, and market research undertaken by other publishing companies and consultants, before going on to look at some of the existing internal sources that commissioning editors can draw on. It considers both qualitative and quantitative ways of testing and developing a commissioning editor's understanding of end-users to improve market reach and customer satisfaction. The article concludes with a case study illustrating how one publisher used research on end-users to improve its products and be more successful in the market. (C) Francis Dodds 2015"
"The article is an attempt to interpret the twentieth century. The interpretation is anchored between Jose Ortega y Gasset's characterization of the modern art of the early twentieth century and postmodernists' characterization of the late twentieth century. Developments in arts, religion, politics, economy, sports and science are treated from this perspective."
"AimsTo review and discuss authorship and author order in the context of nursing and midwifery publications and to present a set of principles to guide and justify author order. BackgroundVariation in author order trends is evident across different authors, disciplines and countries. Confusion and conflict between authors give rise to important issues concerning ethics and collaboration and may delay publication. Lack of transparency in authorship practices also impedes judgements when individual contributions are used in support of employment, promotion, tenure and/or research funding applications. DesignDiscussion paper. Data sourcesA literature search of BioMed Central, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), MEDLINE with Full Text and PubMed for original peer-reviewed papers published in English between 2007 - 2017, in the disciplines of nursing and midwifery. Implications for nursingMuch is written about authorship practices across disciplines and countries. Despite existing authorship guidelines, author order remains an area of confusion and contention. Disputes about authorship and author order have the potential to cause distrust and breakdowns in research relationships, thereby disrupting nursing and midwifery scholarship and research. The main issues concern honorary and ghost authorship, authorship versus acknowledgement, confusion about collaboration, author order, research students as co-authors, equal author credit and the need for explicit guidelines. ConclusionGood communication and mutual respect are crucial to the authorship process. However, clear instructions are needed to guide decisions on authorship and author order. It is recommended that the first-last-author-emphasis be adopted uniformly internationally across nursing and midwifery research."
"The references cited in scientific articles are as important as any other part of the paper, because of their usefulness to the scientific community and to abstracting and indexing services and citation databases. I studied inaccuracies in references and in-text citations in sample of 97 of the 519 peer-reviewed journals accredited by the Iranian National Commission for Journal Accreditation Policy (Ministry of Research, Science and Technology). The target journals published 2,980 articles with 74,577 cited references and 108,151 in-text citations. The results showed 36.6% as the average percentage error rate (range 5.6% to 61.3%). The mean number of errors in cited reference and in-text citations was 2.7 per article, and the mean number of errors per journal was 690. For the entire sample of articles, 4,369 in-text citations did not match any source in the list of references (4%), and 8,683 cited references did not match any in-text citation (11.6%). The stakeholders in scholarly communication, especially authors, pay insufficient attention to the accuracy of bibliographic references. Peer-reviewed journals should encourage the use of standardized journal policies and quality-control measures regarding peer review, data quality and accuracy."
"A number of bibliometric studies point out that the role of conference publications in computer science differs from that in other traditional fields. Thus, it is interesting to identify the relative status of journal and conference publications in different subfields of computer science based on the citation rates categorised by the China Computer Federation (CCF) classifications and venue types. In this research, we construct a dataset containing over 100,000 papers recommended by the CCF catalogue and their citation information. We also investigate some other factors that often influence a paper's citation rate. An experimental study shows that the relative status of journals and conferences varies greatly in different subfields of computer science, and the impact of different publication levels varies according to the citation rate. We also verify that the classification of a publication, number of authors, maximum h-index of all authors of a paper, and average number of papers published by a publication have different effects on the citation rate, although the citation rate may have a different degree of correlation with these factors."
"This study investigates the trend of global concentration in scientific research and technological innovation around the world. It accepts papers and patents as appropriate data for revealing the development and status of science and technology respectively. The performance of these outputs in production and citation impact is taken into consideration in the analysis. The findings suggest that both papers and patents are geographically concentrated on a small number of countries, including the United States, the United Kingdom, Japan, Germany, and France. China has made great progress in paper production and citation impact, and Taiwan and Korea have experienced a rapid growth in patents over the past years. The degree of concentration dramatically decreases when the data from the United States are excluded, indicating the effects of the U.S.'s participation on the concentration. Patents show a higher degree of concentration than papers. With time-varying aspects taken into consideration, the study indicates that the degree of concentration of papers and patents has gradually decreased over time. The concentration of patents has declined more slowly than that of papers. This decrease of the concentration is mainly due to the reduction of the predominant role of the U.S. in world R&D output.

"Purpose - Scholars rely on electronic databases to conduct searches and locate relevant citations. The purpose of this paper is to compare the retrieval results on the same topic (multiple sclerosis and liberation therapy) of two commonly used databases for searching print news media: ProQuest's Canadian Newsstand Major Dailies and Dow Jones' Factiva. Design/methodology/approach - A case study comparing two electronic searchable databases using the same keywords, date range, and newspaper-specific search parameters across three Canadian university institutions. Findings - Considerable differences were found between institutional searches using Factiva. Factiva allows all individual users the capacity to establish systems-wide ""administrator"" privileges, thereby controlling the output for subsequent users if these preferences are not changed. The capacity for individual users to tailor searches within Canadian Newsstand Major Dailies was more in line with standard protocols for institutions paying for single user accounts with access to multiple sessions within that same institution: any user-specific searching/retrieval preferences are individually contained within a search and do not influence the searches of a different user. Research limitations/implications - What began as a comparative analysis of two commonly used databases for searching print news media turned into an examination of larger systemic problems. The findings call into question several factors: the integrity of a researcher-generated data set; the quality of results published in peer-reviewed journals based on researcher-generated data sets derived from established e-resource databases; the reliability of the same e-resource database across multiple institutions; and the quality of e-resource databases for scholarly research when developed to serve primarily non-academic clients. Originality/value - No comparison of this kind for these particular e-resource databases has been documented in the literature. In fact, the scholarly publications that address questions of functionality and reliability of either Factiva or Proquest have not brought this issue into the discussion. Therefore, this study furthers academic discourse on the nature and reliability of database use at any academic institution and illustrates that researchers, in a variety of academic fields, cannot depend on the reliability of their search results without thoroughly consulting the various settings of their database."
"This study aimed to identify and to analyze characteristics of top-cited articles published in the Web of Science chemical engineering subject category from 1899 to 2011. Articles that have been cited more than 100 times were assessed regarding publication outputs, and distribution of outputs in journals. Five bibliometric indicators were used to evaluate source countries, institution and authors. A new indicator, Y-index, was created to assess quantity and quality of contribution to articles. Results showed that 3828 articles, published between 1931 and 2010, had been cited at least 100 times. Among them 54% published before 1991, and 49% top-cited articles originated from US. The top eight productive institutions were all located in US. The top journals were Journal of Catalysis, AIChE Journal, Chemical Engineering Science and Journal of Membrane Science. Y-index was successfully applied to evaluate publication character of authors, institutions, and countries/regions."
"Despite fruitful studies on knowledge flow and interdisciplinarity, there are few investigations on knowledge flow in humanities and social sciences (HSS) and how knowledge from science and technology diffuses to HSS sub-disciplines. Based on Chinese and English articles in HSS, this study explored knowledge flow in China's HSS with an analysis of Chinese and English publications from 1998 to 2014. Findings include: (1) the interdisciplinarity degree of knowledge absorption in social sciences is higher than that of humanities in both Chinese and English articles, meanwhile the degree of interdisciplinarity in all HSS sub-disciplines increased constantly; (2) Chinese scholars in HSS increasingly tended to learn knowledge in hard sciences and applied it to their domains, especially in English articles; (3) in Chinese articles, Economics was the most crucial knowledge base, while Management, Education and Law were absorption-oriented sub-disciplines; in English articles Management, Law, Literature and Philosophy were absorption-oriented sub-disciplines."
"This article describes a bibliometric review of the publications on obesity research in PubMed over the last 20 years. We used Medline via the PubMed online service of the US National Library of Medicine from 1988 to 2007. The search strategy was: ([obesity] in MesH). A total of 58 325 references were retrieved, 25.5% in 1988-1997, and 74.5% in 1998-2007. The growth in the number of publications showed an exponential increase. The references were published in 3613 different journals, with 20 journals contributing 25% of obesity literature. The two journals contributing most were the International Journal of Obesity (5.1%), Obesity-Obesity Research (2.9%). North America and Europe were the most productive world areas with 44.1% and 37.9% of the literature, respectively. The US was the predominant country in number of publications, followed by the United Kingdom, Japan and Italy. The ranking of production changed when the number of publications was normalized by population, gross domestic product and obesity prevalence by countries. The great increase of publications on obesity during the period 19882007 was particularly evident in the second decade of the period which is concordant with the worldwide obesity epidemic. USA and Europe were leaders in the production of scientific articles on obesity."
"The use of bibliometric indicators (impact factor [IF], impact index, h-index, etc.) is now believed to be a fundamental measure of the quality of scientific research output. In this context, the presence of scientific nursing journals in international databases and the factors influencing their impact ratings is being widely analyzed. Purpose: The aim of this study was to analyze the presence of scientific nursing journals in international databases and track the changes in their IF. Methods: A secondary analysis was carried out on data for the years 2009 to 2014 held in the JCR database (subject category: nursing). Additionally, the presence of scientific nursing journals in Medline, CINAHL, Scopus, and SJR was analyzed. Discussion: During the period studied, the number of journals indexed in the JCR under the nursing subject category increased from 70 in 2009 (mean IF: 0.99, standard deviation: 0.53) to 115 in 2014 (mean IF: 1.04, standard deviation: 0.42), of which only 70 were listed for the full six years. Although mean IF showed an upward trend throughout this time, no statistically significant differences were found in the variations to this figure. Conclusion: Although IF and other bibliometric indicators have their limitations, it is nonetheless true that bibliometry is now the most widely used tool for evaluating scientific output in all disciplines, including nursing, highlighting the importance of being familiar with how they are calculated and their significance when deciding the journal or journals in which to publish the results of our research. That said, it is also necessary to consider other possible alternative ways of assessing the quality and impact of scientific contributions."
"Common sense suggests that persistence is key to success. In academia, successful researchers have been found more likely to be persistent in publishing, but little attention has been given to how persistence in maintaining collaborative relationships affects career success. This paper proposes a new bibliometric understanding of persistence that considers the prominent role of collaboration in contemporary science. Using this perspective, we analyze the relationship between persistent collaboration and publication quality along several dimensions: degree of transdisciplinarity, difference in coauthor's scientific age and their scientific impact, and research-team size. Contrary to traditional wisdom, our results show that persistent scientific collaboration does not always result in high-quality papers. We find that the most persistent transdisciplinary collaboration tends to output high-impact publications, and that those coauthors with diverse scientific impact or scientific ages benefit from persistent collaboration more than homogeneous compositions. We also find that researchers persistently working in large groups tend to publish lower-impactpapers. These results contradict the colloquial understanding of collaboration in academia and paint a more nuanced picture of how persistent scientific collaboration relates to success, a picture that can provide valuable insights to researchers, funding agencies, policy makers, and mentor-mentee program directors. Moreover, the methodology in this study showcases a feasible approach to measure persistent collaboration."
"Although the scientific peer review process is crucial to distributing research investments, little has been reported about the decision-making processes used by reviewers. One key attribute likely to be important for decision-making is reviewer expertise. Recent data from an experimental blinded review utilizing a direct measure of expertise has found that closer intellectual distances between applicant and reviewer lead to harsher evaluations, possibly suggesting that information is differentially sampled across subject-matter expertise levels and across information type (e. g. strengths or weaknesses). However, social and professional networks have been suggested to play a role in reviewer scoring. In an effort to test whether this result can be replicated in a real-world unblinded study utilizing self-assessed reviewer expertise, we conducted a retrospective multi-level regression analysis of 1,450 individual unblinded evaluations of 725 biomedical research funding applications by 1,044 reviewers. Despite the large variability in the scoring data, the results are largely confirmatory of work from blinded reviews, by which a linear relationship between reviewer expertise and their evaluations was observed-reviewers with higher levels of self-assessed expertise tended to be harsher in their evaluations. However, we also found that reviewer and applicant seniority could influence this relationship, suggesting social networks could have subtle influences on reviewer scoring. Overall, these results highlight the need to explore how reviewers utilize their expertise to gather and weight information from the application in making their evaluations."
"This study investigates South-South collaboration in research, and specifically collaboration among the 15 countries of the Southern African Development Community (SADC) as well as between the SADC and the rest of Africa. It was found that only 3% of SADC papers during 2005-2008 were jointly authored by researchers from two or more SADC countries (intra-regional collaboration), and only 5% of SADC papers were jointly authored with researchers from African countries outside the SADC (continental collaboration). In contrast, 47% of SADC papers were co-authored with scientists from high-income countries. The few instances of intra-regional and continental collaboration in the SADC are largely the product of North-South collaboration. Authors from high-income countries are included in 60% of intra-regional co-authored papers and in 59% of continental co-authored papers. Moreover, between 2005 and 2008, South Africa produced 81% of all SADC papers and 78% of all intra-regional co-authored papers. This implies that there is a highly unbalanced and unequal partnership that can best be described as a variant of North-South collaboration with the scientific giant in the South taking on the role of the 'political North'. As a consequence, guidelines for successful North-South collaborations should be extended to include South-South collaborations that comprise highly unequal partners, as is the case between South Africa and the other SADC countries."
"Since 1968 the Croatian Mathematical Society has issued annual reports on activities of its members in the scientific journal Glasnik Matematiki. Based on these data was analysed production of mathematical scientific articles published in national and international journals in the period of forty years. A rough estimate of the intensity and dynamics of the publication shows that the publication of the reference period can be divided into two stages separated by the War in Croatia. After a period of uncertainty of the 2nd World war the period preceding was characterized by establishing new institutes, colleges and university departments. After the War in Croatia a gradual but large increase in the number of published articles was evident, especially in foreign journals. The War diminished technical writing almost to the zero while increase of scientific production was 9 times greater in 2008 than in 1968."
"ObjectiveThe objective of this study was to assess global research output in the field of PET and to provide a general picture of PET research.Materials and methodsPublications on PET from 2007 to 2016 were identified using the Web of Science. The total number of papers, the number of papers adjusted by gross domestic product (GDP)/population size, total citations, and average citations were investigated.ResultsA total of 40670 papers were identified in the field of PET between 2007 and 2016. The number of papers published per year were significantly increased during this period (P=0.000). High-income countries published the maximum papers (89.95%), followed by middle-income countries (10.05%), whereas no papers were published by authors from low-income countries. The USA published the largest number of papers (11936), followed by Japan (3667), Germany (3424), China (2508), and the UK (2424), and the USA had the highest total number of citations (361498). The UK had the highest average citations (31.81). Positive correlations were found between the total number of papers and GDP (P=0.000, r=0.909)/population (P=0.000, r=0.772). When normalized by GDP, Denmark ranked the first (23.56), followed by The Netherlands (17.18) and Belgium (15.32). When adjusted for population, Denmark ranked the first (111.55), followed by The Netherlands (87.91) and Switzerland (86.93).ConclusionGlobal scientific production represents a rapid increase in the PET field in recent years. The majority of PET papers are from high-income countries. The USA is the most prolific country, whereas some smaller European countries may be more prolific relative to their GDP/population."
"Brazil is now self-sufficient and actually a net exporter in many core areas. This newly found wealth is being partially transferred to feed an increased demand for scholarly content. Brazil has the lofty goal of leading the region, if not the world, in amassing subscriptions to content that will hopefully educate its people to further accelerate growth in Brazil and bring it closer to par with developed nations. Through the CAPES Consortia and its Portal, one of Brazil's main vehicles for content acquisition and dissemination under the Ministry of Education, it has amassed more than 23,000 periodical titles, and countless other sources. Use of the Portal has increased more than 2,100% since it was created and now exceeds 18 million full-text downloads/year and more than 155,000 accesses/day. This article hopes to identify the challenges in tapping this market, and provide some suggestions in pursuing subscription opportunities in Brazil. It is important to understand the economic and psychological drivers that will make a publisher successful in these uncertain times, including the need for flexibility, and the need to forge and maintain relationships, to understand the political and financial climate with the help from 'in-country' representation, and generally to think creatively.

"This study examined references found in three journals in the field of Spanish and Latin American literary studies. Few previous studies have examined types of publishers producing highly cited/referenced books. The data indicate that the primary publishers of scholarly monographs referenced in the journals are U.S. university presses, foreign academic trade presses, and foreign popular trade presses. U.S. university presses, foreign academic trade presses, and government entities published most of the volumes of collected essays referenced. Scholarly monographs published outside the U.S. represented the largest proportions of references, with large growth in references to volumes of collected essays published in the United States. References to English-language materials increased significantly from 1970 to 2000."
"BACKGROUND Although hematology and oncology research is a highly relevant and evolving field, research contributions by Latin American countries, apart from Brazil, remain unclear. METHODS The authors performed a bibliometric analysis through a methodical search of the Latin American abstracts presented at 4 main hematology and oncology annual scientific meetings from 2000 to 2010. Latin American regional and national productivity was described through distribution and trend analyses; the subsequent percentage of full-text publications was also determined. RESULTS In total, 2871 abstracts were identified, of which 1972 abstracts (68.7%) were determined to be original Latin American research and were included in the analysis. Brazil produced by far the most abstracts, with 51.1% of the total, followed by Argentina, Mexico, Peru, Chile, and Uruguay. Together, these 6 countries accounted for 95.2% of the abstracts. Latin America had a positive trend, registering an average increase of 21.5 abstracts per year (P < .001). Significant positive growth trends were observed for Brazil, Mexico, Peru, and Uruguay. Argentina and Uruguay were the most productive countries when considering the rate of abstract presentation per population. The full-text publication rate was 17.9%, and the median time to publication after presentation was 1 year. Brazil prevailed as the leading publishing country (60%), followed by Mexico, Argentina, Peru, Chile, and Cuba, all of which together published 96% of the full-text articles. CONCLUSIONS Hematology and oncology research is increasing in Latin America, but this contribution remains limited to a few countries. There is also a low rate of full-text articles derived from annual scientific meetings. More extensive research is recommended. Cancer 2014;120:1237-1245. (c) 2013 American Cancer Society."
"Assessments of research groups by expert panels are commonplace. A conceptual distinction between nationwide evaluations, approaches fitting within a national framework, and approaches fulfilling a national, regional, or local regulatory requirement can be made. Few papers exploit the wealth of the data made available to panels: most analyses and discussions focus on the relation between assessments scores and bibliometric indicators. However, expert panels are expected to take other information such as funding and PhDs into account as well. Using a data set on 52 science research groups that have been evaluated in view of an on-going series of research assessments at the University of Antwerp (Belgium), we build cumulative logistic regression models that explain the assessments of research group quality and productivity. In addition to the discipline, the predictors in the models explaining quality and productivity are group size, h-index of the group leader, and efficiency in terms of publishing in top journals. Strikingly, the same predictors apply in the model for quality and in the model for productivity."
"Studies on publication and citation scores tend to focus mostly on frequently published and cited scholars. This paper contributes to advancing knowledge by simultaneously looking into both high and low performing scholars, including non-publishing scholars, and by focusing on factors increasing or impeding scholarly performances. To this end, two complementary sources of data are used: (1) data from ISI web of science on publications and citations of scholars from 35 Canadian business schools and, and (2) survey data on factors explaining the productivity and impact performances of these scholars. The analysis of the data reveals five scholar profiles: (i) non-publishing scholars; (ii) low performing scholars; (iii) frequently publishing scholars; (iv) frequently cited scholars and; (v) high-impact frequently publishing scholars. Statistical modeling is then used to look into factors that explain why scholars are any of these performance configuration rather another. Two major results emerge: first, scholars in the low performing profile differ from those in the non-publishing profile only by being in top tier universities and by having high levels of funding from research councils. Second, scholars who publish frequently and are frequently cited differ from those in the low performing profile in many ways: they are full professors, they dedicate more time to their research activities, they receive all their research funding from research councils, and, finally, they are located in top tier universities. The last part of the paper discusses policy implications for the development of research skills by university managers willing to increase the publication and citation scores of their faculty members."
"Over the last few decades, the institutionalisation of quantitative research evaluations has created incentives for scholars to publish as many papers as possible. This paper assesses the effects of such incentives on individual researchers' scientific impact, by analysing the relationship between their number of articles and their proportion of highly cited papers. In other words, does the share of an author's top 1% most cited papers increase, remain stable, or decrease as his/her total number of papers increase? Using a large dataset of disambiguated researchers (N = 28,078,476) over the 1980-2013 period, this paper shows that, on average, the higher the number of papers a researcher publishes, the higher the proportion of these papers are amongst the most cited. This relationship is stronger for older cohorts of researchers, while decreasing returns to scale are observed for recent cohorts. On the whole, these results suggest that for established researchers, the strategy of publishing as many papers as possible did not yield lower shares of highly cited publications, but such a pattern is not always observed for younger scholars."
"Purpose - The web application presented in this paper allows for an analysis to reveal centres of excellence in different fields worldwide using publication and citation data. Only specific aspects of institutional performance are taken into account and other aspects such as teaching performance or societal impact of research are not considered. The purpose of this paper is to address these issues. Design/methodology/approach - Based on data gathered from Scopus, field-specific excellence can be identified in institutions where highly-cited papers have been frequently published. Findings - The web application (www.excellencemapping.net) combines both a list of institutions ordered by different indicator values and a map with circles visualising indicator values for geocoded institutions. Originality/value - Compared to the mapping and ranking approaches introduced hitherto, our underlying statistics (multi-level models) are analytically oriented by allowing the estimation of values for the number of excellent papers for an institution which are statistically more appropriate than the observed values; the calculation of confidence intervals as measures of accuracy for the institutional citation impact; the comparison of a single institution with an ""average"" institution in a subject area: and the direct comparison of at least two institutions."
"The concept of peer review, in the form of the submission of manuscripts to refereed journals, is analysed. Standard received sociological and philosophical accounts of the place of peer review in the production of knowledge are summarized and critiqued. An alternative 'constructivist' account is given, and this account is also critiqued. An account of the 'Social Text Affair' is given, and it is argued that the affair is instructive for understanding the place of peer review in the production of knowledge. An account of the author's communications with the editors of Ulrich's International Directory of Periodicals about Social Text is given. Finally, the sociological concept of 'boundary work' is introduced, and it is concluded that peer review is a form of 'boundary work.'"
"Publishing professionals concern themselves with the textual and graphic details of the content they publish. Editors, specifically, are responsible for checking and correcting the details of language, style, format, and typography. As precise as editors are paid to be, the nomenclature employed by editing professionals to identify the type of editing required by manuscripts, to communicate about editorial activity, and to evaluate editorial work is, ironically, imprecise. This article identifies the nomenclature used in the publishing industry, the scholarly publishing sector specifically, to label, describe, and discuss editorial activity. It provides an overview of terminology and definitions garnered from a review of literature on the subject of editing. It also presents the results of an original survey of editorial professionals, conducted online, which solicited responses to questions about terms and valuations in the practice of copy-editing. Based on these data, the article draws conclusions and makes suggestions about potential courses of action for standardizing editorial nomenclature in the publishing industry."
"The present paper studies the internationality of Spanish scholarly journals indexed in Web of Science and Scopus on the basis of four key elements identified in the bibliographic review: articles in English, articles by foreign authors, international collaborations and foreign members in editorial teams. Research shows that subject area and access type are determinants in terms of the degree of internationality of the journals, as well as, to a lesser extent, publisher type. The Impact Factor (IF), flagship of bibliometric impact, does not correlate with any element of internationality, while the values of SIR and SNIP moderately correlate with the percentage of international collaborations. Foreign authors' participation is related with English language presence, revealing the orientation of the indexed Spanish journals towards the ""core"" scientific countries. The presence of foreign members in committees is accompanied by that of foreign authors, even though a cause-effect relation cannot be proved. The study concludes providing some insights on future research lines."
"Due to important role of nutrition research in understanding of relevant health subjects and lack of periodic situation analysis of nutrition articles in Iran, this study was conducted to assess nutrition publications in two time intervals of 2001-2005 and 2006-2010 in Farsi scientific journals. A title to title search was performed in all medical, basic science, agricultural and veterinary journals in a 10-year period. All the article titles were placed in techniques, foods, nutritional biochemistry and physiology, nutrition and health, and clinical nutrition subject headings based on Nutrition Abstracts and Reviews Series A (NARA) database. The publication type and the study design were also determined. Statistical analysis was carried out by chi square to test temporal changes. There were 2127 Farsi publications. The original articles consisted 98.1% of the articles. Interventional and survey articles composed 28.1% and 20.8% of the publication types, respectively. Researchers were mostly interested in descriptive articles. Regarding subject, nutrition and health, and clinical nutrition were of the first and second time period interests, respectively. In comparison between the two time periods, regarding subject heading, the proportion of nutrition and health publications showed a significant decline; while, the proportion of clinical nutrition publication showed a remarkable rise. The publication type, subject and study design of the article do not follow coordinated planning and policy making. Therefore, these researches are not efficient enough to solve nutritional problems in our community properly. Planning of the research priorities in the field of food and nutrition with the agreement and participation of all stakeholders is a necessity."
"The study analyzes the relationship between the number of citations as calculated by the IN-RECS database and the quality evaluated by experts. The articles published in journals of the Spanish Psychological Association between 1996 and 2008 and selected by the Editorial Board of Psychology in Spain were the subject of the study. Psychology in Spain is a journal that includes the best papers published throughout the previous year, chosen by the Editorial Board made up of fifty specialists of acknowledged prestige within Spanish psychology and translated into English. The number of the citations of the 140 original articles republished in Psychology in Spain was compared to the number of the citations of the 140 randomly selected articles. Additionally, the study searched for a relationship between the number of the articles selected from each journal and their mean number of citations. The number of citations received by the best articles as evaluated by experts is significantly higher than the number of citations of the randomly selected articles. Also, the number of citations is higher in the articles from the most frequently selected journals. A statistically significant relation between the quality evaluated by experts and the number of the citations was found."
"PRINCIPLES: Citation metrics are commonly used as a proxy for scientific merit and relevance. Papers published in English, however, may exhibit a higher citation frequency than research articles published in other languages, though this issue has not yet been investigated from a Swiss perspective where English is not the native language. METHODS: To assess the impact of publication language on citation frequency we focused on oral surgery papers indexed in PubMed MEDLINE that were published by Swiss Dental Schools between 2002 and 2007. Citation frequency of research papers was extracted from the Institute for Scientific Information (ISI) and Google Scholar database. An univariate and multivariate logistic regression model was used to assess the impact of publication language (English versus German/French) on citation frequency, adjusted for journal impact factor, number of authors and research topic. RESULTS: Papers published in English showed a 6 (ISI database) and 7 (Google Scholar) times higher odds for being cited than research articles published in German or French. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that publication language substantially influences the citation frequency of a research paper. Researchers should publish their work in English to render them accessible to the international scientific community."
"This study offers a unique lens on the patterns, productivity, and impact of researcher mobility at a US research-intensive university. Bibliometric data for Washington State University (WSU) was extracted from Elsevier's Scopus database and analyzed for the 10-year period from 2002 to 2012. We grouped researchers into four categories based on common patterns of movement into, within, and out of the USA: mobile (inflow, outflow, and transitory) versus non-mobile (stationary). We compared the research performances of these different groups using two normalized indicators: relative research productivity and the field-weighted citation impact of the researchers' publications. Our analysis showed that 83% of active researchers at WSU were mobile during the 10-year period based on their having both publications affiliated with WSU and publications affiliated with at least one other institution. The publications of mobile researchers had higher impact compared to non-mobile researchers. Additionally, WSU researchers who primarily moved between other US-based institutions produced publications with higher impact compared to those of internationally mobile researchers, though the latter group was more prolific. Transitory researchers-those spending less than 2 years at either WSU or another institution-comprised the largest sub-group of mobile researchers at 59%. The results of this study offer additional evidence about the value to US universities of researcher mobility and greater research collaborations with both domestic and international partners."
"This paper presents the results of a text based exploratory study of over 20,000 academic articles published in seven top research journals from 1960-2010. The goal is to investigate the general research foci of economists over the last fifty years, how (if at all) they have changed over time, and what trends (if any) can be discerned from a broad body of the top academic research in the field. Of the 19 JEL-code based fields studied in the literature, most have retained a constant level of attention over the time period of this study, however, a notable exception is that of macroeconomics which has undergone a significantly diminishing level of research attention in the last couple of decades, across all the journals under study; at the same time, the ""microfoundations"" of macroeconomic papers appears to be increasing. Other results on co-authorship trends and depth of research articles are also presented."
"The number of references per paper, perhaps the best single index of a journal's scholarliness, has been studied in different disciplines and periods. In this paper we present a four decade study of eight engineering journals. A data set of over 70,000 references was generated after automatic data gathering and manual inspection for errors. Results show a significant increase in the number of references per paper, the average rises from 8 in 1972 to 25 in 2013. This growth presents an acceleration around the year 2000, consistent with a much easier access to search engines and documents produced by the generalization of the Internet."
"Faculty are required to publish. Naive and ""in-a-hurry-to-publish"" authors seek to publish in journals where manuscripts are rapidly accepted. Others may innocently submit to one of an increasing number of questionable/predatory journals, where predatory is defined as practices of publishing journals for exploitation of author-pays, open-access publication model by charging authors publication fees for publisher profit without provision of expected services (expert peer review, editing, archiving, and indexing published manuscripts) and promising almost instant publication. Authors may intentionally submit manuscripts to predatory journals for rapid publication without concern for journal quality. A brief summary of the open access ""movement,"" suggestions for selecting reputable open access journals, and suggestion for avoiding predatory publishers/journals are described. The purpose is to alert junior and seasoned faculty about predatory publishers included among available open access journal listings. Brief review of open access publication, predatory/questionable journal characteristics, suggestions for selecting reputable open access journals and avoiding predatory publishers/journals are described. Time is required for intentionally performing due diligence in open access journal selection, based on publisher/journal quality, prior to manuscript submission or authors must be able to successfully withdraw manuscripts when submission to a questionable or predatory journal is discovered."
"Background Research activities on Alzheimer's disease have increased enormously recently. A differentiation between publications of major and minor importance has become difficult even for experts. Scientometric data on developments and tendencies in Alzheimer's disease research were not available to date. The aim of this study was to evaluate the scientific efforts in Alzheimer's disease research. Methods Large-scale data analyses, density-equalising algorithms and scientometric methods were used to evaluate the quantity and quality of research achievements of scientists studying Alzheimer's disease. Density-equalising algorithms were applied to data retrieved from ISI-Web. Results From 1985 to 2008, 50030 publications on Alzheimer's disease were published and included in the database. Approximately 97% of the articles were written in English. The USA was identified as the most prolific country during that period, Canada and the UK were the most important cooperation partners followed by Germany and France, as well as other industrialised countries such as Japan and Australia. Conclusion Our results indicate an increase in research activities after 1990 which can be explained by some important research results and an increasing importance in the media. The study results imply that currently established measures of research output (i.e., impact factor, h-index) should be evaluated critically because trends, such as self-citation and co-authorship, distort the results and limit their suitability as measures of research quality."
"Purpose - This study, using a new method called Referenced Publication Years Spectroscopy (RPYS), aims to examine the most important historic works written in the area of knowledge management (KM). Design/methodology/approach - Preliminary data of this study have been extracted from Web of Science through scientometric methods. The references used in all the papers in the core journals in this field since 1980 to the end of 2014 were studied. Findings - The distribution of resources in the area of KM based on the publication year indicates that this field of study, during time intervals 1900 to 1980, has seen eight major mutations. A considerable influence of such fields as economics, business, social networks analysis, organizational learning and economic sociology on the realm of KM is evident. The association of Polanyi with the mutations of 1958, 1962 and 1967 suggests his obvious influence on the evolution of KM. The ratio of articles to books among the whole documents detected by RPYS was 2-13 which could direct us to the point that the channel for information transformation in KM is more focused on books than on articles. Originality/value - None of the few studies done by scientometric methods in the realm of KM has been seen through the issue of the historical origins of this area. This piece of research, using a new scientometric method, can be considered the first study in which the origins of KM over time have been studied."
This Letter to the Editor proposes to use the CSS method for classifying ranking results (e.g. from university rankings) into meaningful groups.
"This paper reports a bibliometric analysis of the impact of research in China oil cyclization, MALDI-TOF, and antibiotics, comparing this research with that in the USA, Germany, and Japan. It is shown that the productivity of the Chinese research (in terms of numbers of publications) is growing rapidly; however, this growth has not, to date, been accompanied by an analogous growth in impact (in terms of citations to the published work). A citation analysis of national and international collaboration patterns shows that collaborative research does not invariably result in a larger number of citations; in part, at least, this is shown to be due to the dominant role played by the publications of the Chinese Academy of Sciences."
"Object. Bibliometrics is defined as the study of statistical and mathematical methods used to quantitatively analyze scientific literature. The application of bibliometrics in neurosurgery is in its infancy. The authors calculate a number of publication productivity measures for almost all academic neurosurgeons and departments within the US. Methods. The h-index, g-index, m-quotient, and contemporary h-index (he-index) were calculated for 1225 academic neurosurgeons in 99 (of 101) programs listed by the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education in January 2013. Three currently available citation databases were used: Google Scholar, Scopus, and Web of Science. Bibliometric profiles were created for each surgeon. Comparisons based on academic rank (that is, chairperson, professor, associate, assistant, and instructor), sex, and subspecialties were performed. Departments were ranked based on the summation of individual faculty h-indices. Calculations were carried out from January to February 2013. Results. The median h-index, g-index, he-index, and m-quotient were 11, 20, 8, and 0.62, respectively. All indices demonstrated a positive relationship with increasing academic rank (p <0.001). The median h-index was 11 for males (n = 1144) and 8 for females (n = 81). The h-index, g-index and he-index significantly varied by sex (p <0.001). However, when corrected for academic rank, this difference was no longer significant. There was no difference in the m-quotient by sex. Neurosurgeons with subspecialties in functional/epilepsy, peripheral nerve, radiosurgery, neurooncology/skull base, and vascular have the highest median h-indices; general, pediatric, and spine neurosurgeons have the lowest median h-indices. By summing the manually calculated Scopus h-indices of all individuals within a department, the top 5 programs for publication productivity are University of California, San Francisco; Barrow Neurological Institute; Johns Hopkins University; University of Pittsburgh; and University of California, Los Angeles. Conclusions. This study represents the most detailed publication analysis of academic neurosurgeons and their programs to date. The results for the metrics presented should be viewed as benchmarks for comparison purposes. It is our hope that organized neurosurgery will adopt and continue to refine bibliometric profiling of individuals and departments."
"Examination of a limited number of publisher's Instructions for Authors, guidelines from two scientific societies, and the widely accepted policy document of the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors (ICMJE) provided useful information on authorship practices. Three of five journals examined (Nature, Science, and the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences) publish papers across a variety of disciplines. One is broadly focused on topics in medical research (New England Journal of Medicine) and one publishes research reports in a single discipline (Journal of Bacteriology). Similar elements of publication policy and accepted practices were found across the policies of these journals articulated in their Instructions for Authors. A number of these same elements were found in the professional society guidelines of the Society for Neuroscience and the American Chemical Society, as well as the ICMJE Uniform Requirements for Manuscripts Submitted to Biomedical Journals. Taken together, these sources provide the basis for articulating best practices in authorship in scientific research. Emerging from this material is a definition of authorship, as well as policy statements on duplicative publication, conflict of interest disclosure, electronic access, data sharing, digital image integrity, and research requiring subjects' protection, including prior registration of clinical trials. These common elements provide a foundation for teaching about scientific authorship and publication practices across biomedical and life sciences disciplines."
"The present analysis of research productivity of scholars in Georgia was motivated by the disadvantageous position of Georgia in international listings of the most cited scientific articles. We used official databases provided by governmental Shota Rustaveli National Scientific Foundation (SRNSF) from 2007 to 2013. In this research we have restricted our analysis by the consideration of bibliometric indicators of the leaders of the awarded projects. Three bibliometric characteristics: the number of publications and citations, as well as H-index of project leaders was obtained from SCOPUS database. According to our results, just 58% of all leaders of awarded projects in SRNSF grant competition, have an article (at least one) in the Scopus database for the entire period of their scholarly activity. From our analysis it follows that the quality of reviewing of the projects, presented to the SRNSF grant competition, does not promote a selection of the most productive project teams; there is no correlation between values of SRNSF reviewer's evaluation scores and the bibliometric data of project leaders in the Scopus database. As a result, in 2007-2012 in spite of large enough (for Georgia) funding, the problem of the low productivity and quality of scientific research in Georgia has not been resolved. We conclude that, in order to improve the situation with the low productivity of research in Georgia, the governmental programs of science support should be based on the new system of evaluation of the quality of presented projects; namely, peer-review approach should be combined with the bibliometric methodology. Besides local interest, for Georgian researchers and governmental authorities, the results of presented research have general importance in the light of ongoing international discussions about the necessity of inclusion of bibliometric data in evaluation procedures of research productivity. Presented results and discussions will be especially helpful for scholars and research administrators from countries in transition and could facilitate in elaboration of effective research funding policy."
"Funding has been viewed in the literature as one of the main determinants of scientific activities. Also, at an individual level, securing funding is one of the most important factors for a researcher, enabling him/her to carry out research projects. However, not everyone is successful in obtaining the necessary funds. The main objective of this work is to measure the effect of several important factors such as past productivity, scientific collaboration or career age of researchers, on the amount of funding that is allocated to them. For this purpose, the paper estimates a temporal non-linear multiple regression model. According to the results, although past productivity of researchers positively affects the funding level, our findings highlight the significant role of networking and collaboration. It was observed that being a member of large scientific teams and getting connected to productive researchers who have also a good control over the collaboration network and the flow of information can increase the chances for securing more money. In fact, our results show that in the quest for the research money it is more important how researchers build their collaboration network than what publications they produce and whether they are cited."
"Scholarly publications reify fruitful collaborations between co-authors. A branch of research in the science studies focuses on analyzing the co-authorship networks of established scientists. Such studies tell us about how their collaborations developed through their careers. This paper updates previous work by reporting a transversal and a longitudinal studies spanning the lifelong careers of a cohort of researchers from the DBLP bibliographic database. We mined 3,860 researchers' publication records to study the evolution patterns of their co-authorships. Two features of co-authors were considered: (1) their expertise, and (2) the history of their partnerships with the sampled researchers. Our findings reveal the ephemeral nature of most collaborations: 70 % of the new co-authors were only one-shot partners since they did not appear to collaborate on any further publications. Overall, researchers consistently extended their co-authorships (1) by steadily enrolling beginning researchers (i.e., people who had never published before), and (2) by increasingly working with confirmed researchers with whom they already collaborated."
"Background: Despite the widely recognised importance of sustainable health care systems, health services research remains generally underfunded in Australia. The Australian Centre for Health Services Innovation (AusHSI) is funding health services research in the state of Queensland. AusHSI has developed a streamlined protocol for applying and awarding funding using a short proposal and accelerated peer review. Method: An observational study of proposals for four health services research funding rounds from May 2012 to November 2013. A short proposal of less than 1,200 words was submitted using a secure web-based portal. The primary outcome measures are: time spent preparing proposals; a simplified scoring of grant proposals (reject, revise or accept for interview) by a scientific review committee; and progressing from submission to funding outcomes within eight weeks. Proposals outside of health services research were deemed ineligible. Results: There were 228 eligible proposals across 4 funding rounds: from 29% to 79% were shortlisted and 9% to 32% were accepted for interview. Success rates increased from 6% (in 2012) to 16% (in 2013) of eligible proposals. Applicants were notified of the outcomes within two weeks from the interview; which was a maximum of eight weeks after the submission deadline. Applicants spent 7 days on average preparing their proposal. Applicants with a ranking of reject or revise received written feedback and suggested improvements for their proposals, and resubmissions composed one third of the 2013 rounds. Conclusions: The AusHSI funding scheme is a streamlined application process that has simplified the process of allocating health services research funding for both applicants and peer reviewers. The AusHSI process has minimised the time from submission to notification of funding outcomes."
"This study carries out a bibliometric retrospective of the journal Eurasia Journal of Mathematics, Science and Technology Education (EJMSTE) between 2012 and 2017 by using the bibliometric analysis and visualizing approaches. A series of bibliometric indicators, such as H-Classics publications, major prolific authors, institutions and countries and research themes etc., were included. With the help of 655 structured data retrieved from the Web of Science, we found a rapid growth trend of published productions. The most prolific authors, institutions and countries (territories) are mainly from Turkey and Taiwan, and this indicates this journal was dominated by these two countries (territories). Analysis of research themes showed science education, teacher education, mathematics education, attitude/attitudes research, problem solving and professional development were the main research themes for this journal. The citation impact analysis of research theme showed that three themes (i.e., student teacher, Technology Acceptance Model and animals) attracted more citations than others. Six clusters were identified which formed the main knowledge base of this journal. Analysis of cited and citing journals presented the knowledge commutation status of EJMSTE between other journals. These findings will help the readers to get a quick and intuitive overview and may be useful for helping the possible authors in deciding if their papers should be submitted to EJMSTE."
"Background: The number and quality of publications is an indirect measure of the capacity of an individual, institution or country to generate knowledge. Aim: To assess the number of publications of Chilean surgeons, registered in the Institute for Scientific Knowledge (ISI). Material and Methods: A search was conducted in the ISI platform for publications generated by Chilean surgeons in the last ten years. The number of publications and citations, the journals in which the publications appeared and nationality of coauthors, were analyzed. Results: Three hundred and eighty papers were identified. Of these, 333 (88%) were published in the period 2006-2010. The papers were cited in 1.946 opportunities (impact factor of 5.12 and h-index of 21). Thirty three percent of papers were published in Revista Chilena de Cirugia, 8% in Obesity Surgery and 4% in the World Journal of Surgery. Thirty four percent of papers came from the University of Chile, 21% from Catholic University and 8% from Universidad de la Frontera. Conclusions: The number of publications of Chilean surgeons is experiencing an increase in the last years."
"Publications of a number of countries on semiconductor nanostructures for 2000-2016 are analyzed on a bibliometric basis. The contribution of Russian participants in the studies and the structure of international scientific ties of domestic scientists are considered in detail. The initial array of the publications was extracted from the Science Citation Index Expanded database using relevant keywords. Information to analyze patent activity was taken from the data of the Russian Federal Service for Intellectual Property (Rospatent), US PTO, and WIPO PATENTSCOPE."
"Recruitment and professorial appointment procedures are crucial for the administration and management of universities and higher education institutions in order to guarantee a certain level of performance quality and reputation. The complementary use of quantitative and objective bibliometric analyses is meant to be an enhancement for the assessment of candidates and a possible antidote for subjective, discriminatory and corrupt practices. In this paper, we present the Vienna University bibliometric approach, offering a method which relies on a variety of basicindicators and further control parameters in order to address the multidimensionality of the problem and to foster comprehensibility. Our ""top counts approach"" allows an appointment committee to pick and choose from a portfolio of indicators according to the actual strategic alignment. Furthermore, control and additional data help to understand disciplinary publication habits, to unveil concealed aspects and to identify individual publication strategies of the candidates. Our approach has already been applied to 14 professorial appointment procedures (PAP) in the life sciences, earth and environmental sciences and social sciences, comprising 221 candidates in all. The usefulness of the bibliometric approach was confirmed by all heads of appointment committees in the life sciences. For the earth and environmental sciences as well as the social sciences, the usefulness was less obvious and sometimes questioned due to the low coverage of the candidates' publication output in the traditional citation data sources. A retrospective assessment of all hitherto performed PAP also showed an overlap between the committees' designated top candidates and the bibliometric top candidates to a certain degree."
"Objective: To assess the level of knowledge about and the attitudes of the Cuban health researchers towards the open access movement. Methods: A descriptive, cross-sectional study was conducted from March to June 2007 through a printed questionnaire administered to a group of Cuban researchers from several national health institutes, who were selected by means of a stratified random sampling (160 researchers from 11 institutions). Summary statistics and bivariate correlations were obtained using the spss statistical program, version 10.0 for Windows. Results: The best known initiatives for researchers were those related to biomedical sciences, i.e. PubMed Central, HINARI and BioMed Central. The rate of publication in open access journals and deposit in open access repositories was low. Most of researchers (85%) agree to upload a copy of their papers onto an open access repository if their institution requests so. Conclusions: Our findings indicate a need for the promotion of the beneficial aspects of the open access movement, as well as training and encouragement for researchers so that they can take full advantage of the potential of this movement."
"Research assessment carries important implications both at the individual and institutional levels. This paper examines the research outputs of scholars in business schools and shows how their performance assessment is significantly affected when using data extracted either from the Thomson ISI Web of Science (WoS) or from Google Scholar (GS). The statistical analyses of this paper are based on a large survey data of scholars of Canadian business schools, used jointly with data extracted from the WoS and GS databases. Firstly, the findings of this study reveal that the average performance of B scholars regarding the number of contributions, citations, and the h-index is much higher when performances are assessed using GS rather than WoS. Moreover, the results also show that the scholars who exhibit the highest performances when assessed in reference to articles published in ISI-listed journals also exhibit the highest performances in Google Scholar. Secondly, the absence of association between the strength of ties forged with companies, as well as between the customization of the knowledge transferred to companies and research performances of B scholars such as measured by indicators extracted from WoS and GS, provides some evidence suggesting that mode 1 and 2 knowledge productions might be compatible. Thirdly, the results also indicate that senior B scholars did not differ in a statistically significant manner from their junior colleagues with regard to the proportion of contributions compiled in WoS and GS. However, the results show that assistant professors have a higher proportion of citations in WoS than associate and full professors have. Fourthly, the results of this study suggest that B scholars in accounting tend to publish a smaller proportion of their work in GS than their colleagues in information management, finance and economics. Fifthly, the results of this study show that there is no significant difference between the contributions record of scholars located in English language and French language B schools when their performances are assessed with Google Scholar. However, scholars in English language B schools exhibit higher citation performances and higher h-indices both in WoS and GS. Overall, B scholars might not be confronted by having to choose between two incompatible knowledge production modes, but with the requirement of the evidence-based management approach. As a consequence, the various assessment exercises undertaken by university administrators, government agencies and associations of business schools should complement the data provided in WoS with those provided in GS."
"Astonishing revolution in information technology, developments in electronic publishing and availability of manuscript management software's has provided lot of facilities to authors, reviewers as well as editors but it has also given birth to lot of e-problems. This communication highlights some of these e-problems besides discussing the manuscript management system practiced by Pakistan Journal of Medical Sciences through modified Open Journal System. It also cautions the editors of small journals faced with financial and human resource constraints to keep themselves abreast of all these developments, go for automation in e publishing gradually as all the stake holders i.e. authors, reviewers and office management staff learns these and become used to it."
"Bibliometric studies often measure and compare scholarly performance, but they rarely investigate why universities, departments, and research groups do have different performance. In this paper we try to explain differences in scholarly performance of research groups in terms of organizational variables. In order to do this, we extensively review the relevant literature, and develop a model using two theoretical approaches. A multivariate analysis shows which of the independent variables do play a role in the various scholarly performance dimensions. The study shows what organizational strategies may help in optimizing performance in various dimensions. Implications are discussed."
"Scientific progress is driven by important, infrequent discoveries that cannot be readily identified and quantified, which makes research assessment very difficult. Bibliometric indicators of important discoveries have been formulated using an empirical approach, based on the mathematical properties of the high-citation tail of the citation distribution. To investigate the theoretical basis of such formulations this study compares the US/European research performance ratios expressed in terms of highly cited papers and Nobel Prize-winning discoveries. The research performance ratio in terms of papers was studied from the citation distributions in the fields of chemistry, physics, and biochemistry and molecular biology. It varied as a function of the citation level. Selecting an appropriate high citation level, the ratios in terms of highly cited papers were compared with the corresponding ratios for Nobel Prize-winning discoveries in Chemistry, Physics, and Physiology or Medicine. Research performance ratios expressed in terms of highly cited papers and Nobel Prize-winning discoveries are reasonably similar, and suggest that the research success of the United States is almost 3 times that of Europe. A similar conclusion was obtained using articles published in Nature and Science."
"This paper presents a condensed history of Library and Information Science (LIS) over the course of more than a century using a variety of bibliometric measures. It examines in detail the variable rate of knowledge production in the field, shifts in subject coverage, the dominance of particular publication genres at different times, prevailing modes of production, interactions with other disciplines, and, more generally, observes how the field has evolved. It shows that, despite a striking growth in the number of journals, papers, and contributing authors, a decrease was observed in the field's market-share of all social science and humanities research. Collaborative authorship is now the norm, a pattern seen across the social sciences. The idea of boundary crossing was also examined: in 2010, nearly 60% of authors who published in LIS also published in another discipline. This high degree of permeability in LIS was also demonstrated through reference and citation practices: LIS scholars now cite and receive citations from other fields more than from LIS itself. Two major structural shifts are revealed in the data: in 1960, LIS changed from a professional field focused on librarianship to an academic field focused on information and use; and in 1990, LIS began to receive a growing number of citations from outside the field, notably from Computer Science and Management, and saw a dramatic increase in the number of authors contributing to the literature of the field."
"The growth of the Brazilian economy in recent years has created an atmosphere of optimism in various segments of Brazilian society, with several important international repercussions. In this paper, we analyze in detail how this economic growth is reflected in investments in science and technology made by major academic funding agencies. As a result, we observed a discrepancy in the growth of funding input and the growth of the Brazilian gross domestic product. This fact associated with an increased academic output entails negative consequences for the system. This may be a symptom of an academic community not fully understood by society and vice versa. Finally, we believe that a long-lasting important change in investment policy in science is necessary in order to ensure financial security for the academic system as a whole."
"Using the theory of planned behavior as a theoretical framework, survey data from 121 authors in the professional field of school librarianship (40% of whom were practitioners) were used to identify beliefs about publishing in the field, attitudes to research and publication, perceived social norms and social influences on research and publication, and perceived barriers to research and publication. The journals in which the authors prefer to publish and their reasons for journal choice are also reported. This is the first reported study to specifically address reasons for publication choice in a professional field, and it indicates that relevance to practice is an important consideration, in addition to scholarly rigor, when authors in professional fields consider where to publish their research. The views and motivations of full professors, other researchers and practitioner-authors were surprisingly similar, although practitioners who had less research preparation than researchers were less confident about their ability to conduct and write-up research. Additionally, researchers other than full professors, and practitioners, reported that the encouragements of peers and supervisors or senior colleagues were important social influences for research and publication.

"Objective: This study aimed at exploring the citation parameters of contact lenses articles published in the Ophthalmology thematic category of the Journal Citation Reports (JCR). Methods: The Thompson Reuters Web of Science database was accessed to record bibliometric information and citation parameters of all journals listed under the Ophthalmology area of the 2011 JCR edition, including the journals with main publication interests in the contact lens field. In addition, the same database was used to unveil all contact lens-related articles published in 2011 in the same thematic area, whereupon differences in citation parameters between those articles published in contact lens and non-contact lens-related journals were explored. Results: Significant differences in some bibliometric indicators such as half-life and overall citation count were found between contact lens-related journals (shorter half-life and fewer citations) and the median values for the Ophthalmology thematic area of the JCR. Visual examination of all Ophthalmology journals uncovered a total of 156 contact lens-related articles, published in 28 different journals, with 27 articles each for Contact Lens & Anterior Eye, Eye & Contact Lens, and Optometry and Vision Science. Significant differences in citation parameters were encountered between those articles published in contact lens and non-contact lens source journals. Conclusions: These findings, which disclosed contact lenses to be a fertile area of research, may be of interest to researchers and institutions. Differences in bibliometric indicators are of relevance to avoid unwanted bias when conducting between-and within-discipline comparisons of articles, journals, and researchers."
"Purpose - Research focussed on various issues or perspectives of business can be considered as an important driving force for business development. The purpose of this paper is to identify the main topics and trends associated with business-related research conducted in Belarus, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Russia, Slovakia and Ukraine. The study results contribute to a context-aware explanation of the dynamics of business-oriented research in individual countries. Design/methodology/approach - This study both quantitatively and semantically analyses 6,166 abstracts indexed and abstracted in the Scopus database. Three main research questions and associated hypotheses are investigated. Three text-mining techniques were applied in the analysis of available resources, namely, word clustering, collocation statistics and correspondence analysis. Findings - There is a growing trend in the quantity of business-related research publications associated with each country. Similarly, there is an increasing internationalisation and intensification process of research networks. It is possible to identify both general and specific business topics that are investigated in individual countries. Research limitations/implications - The time spans investigated do not always correspond with the main events occurring at the national level. From the semantic analysis perspective, the shortage of records for specific time periods prevents a valid semantic analysis, and the results are dependent on the quality of the abstracts provided by the authors. The study results might be used as support for funding decisions or context-aware evaluation of research outcomes at both institutional and national level. Originality/value - This study provides a unique insight into the development and mutual comparison of business-related research in the countries investigated."
"The paper first introduces the basic problems of author bibliographic coupling including the relationship between author bibliographic coupling and document bibliographic coupling as well as the three calculation methods of author coupling strength, namely, simple method, minimum method and combined method. Next I choose a small sample of authors in Chinese library and information science (LIS) as the research objects to have a comparative analysis of three types of author coupling strength algorithms (the data source is from the Chinese Social Sciences Citation Index (CSSCI)). The result shows that the minimum method is the most appropriate one to calculate the author coupling strength. Then a large sample of authors is chosen to analyze the intellectual structure of Chinese LIS. The result shows that author bibliographic coupling analysis (ABCA) can discover the intellectual structure of a discipline better. It is also found that compared with author cocitation analysis (ACA), ABCA has the advantage that it not only can discover the intellectual structure of a discipline more comprehensively and concretely but also can reflect the research frontier of the discipline. Finally, some practical problems that arise during this research are discussed. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."
"Background: To assess how authors would describe their contribution to the submitted manuscript without reference to or requirement to satisfy authorship criteria of the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors (ICMJE), we analyzed responses of authors to an open-ended question ""Why do you think you should be the author on this manuscript?"". Methods: Responses of authors (n=1425) who submitted their manuscripts (n=345) to the Croatian Medical Journal, an international general medical journal, from March 2009 until July 2010 were transcribed and matched to ICMJE criteria. Statements that could not be matched were separately categorized. Responses according to the number of authors or their byline position on the manuscript were analyzed using Mann-Whitney U test and Moses test of extreme reactions. Results: The number of authors per manuscript ranged from 1 to 26 (median=4, IQR=3-6), with the median of 2 contributions per author (IQR=2-3). Authors' responses could be matched to the ICMJE criteria in 1116 (87.0%) cases. Among these, only 15.6% clearly declared contributions from all 3 ICMJE criteria; however, if signing of the authorship form was taken as the fulfillment of the third ICMJE criterion, overall fraction of deserving authorship was 54.2%. Non-ICMJE contributions were declared by 98 (7.6%) authors whose other contributions could be matched to ICMJE criteria, and by 116 (13.0%) authors whose contributions could not be matched to ICMJE criteria. The most frequently reported non-ICMJE contribution was literature review. Authors on manuscripts with more than 8 authors declared more contributions than those on manuscript with 8 or fewer authors: median 2, IQR 1-4, vs. median 2, IQR 1-3, respectively (Mann Whitney U test, p=0.001; Moses Test of Extreme Reactions, p<0.001). Almost a third of single authors (n=9; 31.0%) reported contributions that could not be matched to any ICMJE criterion. Conclusions: In cases of multi-author collaborative efforts but not in manuscripts with fewer authors open-ended authorship declaration without instructions on ICMJE criteria elicited responses from authors that were similar to responses when ICMJE criteria were explicitly required. Current authorship criteria and the practice of contribution declaration should be revised in order to capture deserving authorship in biomedical research."
"In the scientific publication world, there are an increasing number of open access (OA) journals. Many OA journals are financed by the article processing charges (APCs) that they charge authors. There is considerable interest in the funding source of such APCs. In 255 health and life sciences OA journals that charge APCs (APC OA journals) and 183 health and life sciences OA journals that do not charge APCs (free OA journals) that are indexed in the Thomson Reuters Web of Science, this study uses a bibliometric method to examine the relationship between two journal characteristics during 2009-2013: APCs and the percentage of published articles based on work that is supported by grants (grant-funded articles). According to the data collected, the percentage of grant-funded articles increases as the associated APCs increase. Average APCs of APC OA journals are higher in Europe and North America than elsewhere. The study also investigated the top ten countries in the number of scientific publications in the OA journals investigated. All ten countries had lower percentages of grant-funded articles in free OA journals than in APC OA and subscription journals. Of the ten countries, six in Europe and North America have higher percentages of grant-funded articles in APC OA journals than in subscription journals. The other four countries that have lower percentages of grant-funded articles in APC OA journals than in subscription journals are in Asia and South America, which are places where APC OA journals have low average APCs."
"This study aims to identify the way researchers collaborate with other researchers in the course of the scientific research life cycle and provide information to the designers of e-Science and e-Research implementations. On the basis of in-depth interviews with and on-site observations of 24 scientists and a follow-up focus group interview in the field of bioscience/nanoscience and technology in Korea, we examined scientific collaboration using the framework of the scientific research life cycle. We attempt to explain the major motivations, characteristics of communication and information sharing, and barriers associated with scientists' research collaboration practices throughout the research life cycle. The findings identify several notable phenomena including motivating factors, the timing of collaboration formation, partner selection, communication methods, information-sharing practices, and barriers at each phase of the life cycle. We find that specific motivations were related to specific phases. The formation of collaboration was observed throughout the entire process, not only in the beginning phase of the cycle. For communication and information-sharing practices, scientists continue to favor traditional means of communication for security reasons. Barriers to collaboration throughout the phases included different priorities, competitive tensions, and a hierarchical culture among collaborators, whereas credit sharing was a barrier in the research product phase."
"This article is concerned with developing a philosophical approach to a number of significant changes to academic publishing, and specifically the global journal knowledge system wrought by a range of new digital technologies that herald the third age of the journal as an electronic, interactive and mixed-media form of scientific communication. The paper emerges from an Editors' Collective, a small New Zealand-based organisation comprised of editors and reviewers of academic journals mostly in the fields of education and philosophy. The paper is the result of a collective writing process."
"Scientific progress in technology oriented research fields is made by incremental or fundamental inventions concerning natural science effects, materials, methods, tools and applications. Therefore our approach focuses on research activities of such technological elements on the basis of keywords in published articles. In this paper we show how emerging topics in the field of optoelectronic devices based on scientific literature data from the PASCAL-database can be identified. We use Results from PROMTECH project, whose principal objective was to produce a methodology allowing the identification of promising emerging technologies. In this project, the study of the intersection of Applied Sciences as well as Life (Biological & Medical) Sciences domains and Physics with bibliometric methods produced 45 candidate technological fields and the validation by expert panels led to a final selection of 10 most promising ones. These 45 technologies were used as reference fields. In order to detect the emerging research, we combine two methodological approaches. The first one introduces a new modelling of field terminology evolution based on bibliometric indicators: the diffusion model and the second one is a diachronic cluster analysis. With the diffusion model we identified single keywords that represent a high dynamic of the mentioned technology elements. The cluster analysis was used to recombine articles, where the identified keywords were used to technological topics in the field of optoelectronic devices. This methodology allows us to answer the following questions: Which technological aspects within our considered field can be detected? Which of them are already established and which of them are new? How are the topics linked to each other?."
"Authorship problems in scholarly journals shake the foundations of research, diminish scientific quality of papers and devalue records of citation tracking services. The 'Publish or Perish' mantra is thought to drive some instances of unfair, honorary authorship, particularly in countries of emerging scientific power. Though causes of honorary, gift, guest and ghost authorship are still ill-defined, it is possible to avoid some of these instances by improving awareness of what constitutes authorship and by adhering to the editorial policies of learned associations. This paper overviews common cases of inappropriate authorship and suggests options to solve related problems by authors, reviewers and editors of scholarly journals."
"This paper describes the different forms of and tries to give reasons for international scientific collaboration in general. It focuses on eleven countries in the Asia-Pacific region by evaluating their national research output with the help of bibliometric indicators in particular. Over two million journal articles published by these countries between 1998 and 2007 in ISI-listed periodicals are analyzed. Discipline-specific publication and citation profiles reveal national strengths and weaknesses in the different research domains. The exponential increase in publication output by China over the last few years is astonishing, but in terms of visibility, i.e. citation rates, China cannot keep up with leading science nations, remaining below the world average. A discipline-specific analysis shows that Chinese authors took an active part in more than a quarter of all articles and reviews published in the field of materials science in 2007, while their contribution to medical research is very low. Co-publication networks among the eleven countries are generated to observe the development of cooperation bonds in the region. Applying Salton's measure of international collaboration strength, an above-average strengthening of scientific collaboration in the Asia-Pacific region can be observed."
"The developing world contains more than A3/4 of the world's population, and has the largest burden of musculoskeletal disease. Published studies provide crucial information that can influence healthcare policies. Presumably much information regarding burden in the developing world would arise from authors from developing countries. However, the extent of participation of authors from the developing world in widely read orthopaedic journals is unclear. We surveyed four influential English-language orthopaedic journals to document the contributions of authors from developing countries. We surveyed Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research, Journal of Orthopaedic Trauma, and the American and British volumes of The Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery, from May 2007 through May 2010. The country of origin of all authors was identified. We used the designations provided by the International Monetary Fund to define countries as either developed or developing. Two hundred sixty-five of 3964 publications (7%) included authors from developing countries. Ninety percent of these had authors from developing countries with industrialized and emerging-market economies. Publications from Sub-Saharan Africa accounted for only 0.4% of the 3964 articles reviewed and 5.6% of the 265 articles with developing world authorship. Countries with the least robust economies were least represented. Less than 1/3 of articles with authors from the developing world had coauthors from developed or other developing countries. Additional studies are needed to determine the reasons for the low representation noted and to establish strategies to increase the number of orthopaedic publications from parts of the world where the burden of musculoskeletal disease is the greatest."
"Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to present an overview of the current state of debates surrounding Open Access (OA) in non-STEM disciplines. Design/methodology/approach - This paper uses a selective literature review and discussion methodology to give a representative summary of the state of the art. Findings - Non-STEM disciplines persistently lag behind scientific disciplines in their approach to OA, if the teleology towards open dissemination is accepted. This can be attributed to a variety of economic and cultural factors that centre on the problem of resource allocation with respect to quality. Originality/value - This paper will be of value to policymakers, funders, academics and publishers. The original aspect of the paper pertains to the identification of an anxiety of irrelevance in the humanities disciplines and a focus on ""quality"" in Open-Access publishing debates."
"We investigate the extent to which open-access (OA) journals and articles in biology, computer science, economics, history, medicine, and psychology are indexed in each of 11 bibliographic databases. We also look for variations in index coverage by journal subject, journal size, publisher type, publisher size, date of first OA issue, region of publication, language of publication, publication fee, and citation impact factor. Two databases, Biological Abstracts and PubMed, provide very good coverage of the OA journal literature, indexing 60 to 63% of all OA articles in their disciplines. Five databases provide moderately good coverage (22-41%), and four provide relatively poor coverage (0-12%). OA articles in biology journals, English-only journals, high-impact journals, and journals that charge publication fees of $1,000 or more are especially likely to be indexed. Conversely, articles from OA publishers in Africa, Asia, or Central/South America are especially unlikely to be indexed. Four of the 11 databases index commercially published articles at a substantially higher rate than articles published by universities, scholarly societies, nonprofit publishers, or governments. Finally, three databases-EBSCO Academic Search Complete, Pro-Quest Research Library, and Wilson OmniFile-provide less comprehensive coverage of OA articles than of articles in comparable subscription journals."
"Journal rankings are increasingly being used as proxies for assessing the quality and worth of individual faculty and their contribution to institutional performance. Problematic within this agenda is the historical mapping and projection of current journal rankings. Individual papers are being assessed against criteria far removed - temporally - from when decisions were made regarding where to publish. Drawing upon three examples of publishing in educational administration journals, this paper explores how the assessment of paper quality is dislocated from the scholarly labour that generates those outputs in the first place. Different ranking systems and often lengthy submission to publication processes mean that the worth of individual papers can dramatically shift independent of any actual engagement with the content of the paper. The value of an individual's track record can fluctuate quickly and any intervention to alter the situation takes time to come into effect. This paper does not suggest replacing one ranking system with another, or even remove research assessment. Rather, it offers a means of problematising the application of journal rankings by calling into question their timelessness. In doing, it provides the intellectual resources to make strange the status quo and open the prospect of alternatives."
"This article reports findings from a study of the relationship between citation measures (impact factor and its quartile) among international composition of editorial board and foreign authorship in 17 Korean SCI journals for the three 5-year periods, 1995, 2000, and 2005. With few exceptions, the relationship between international editorial board composition and foreign authorship and citation measures was non-existent, at p > 0.05. However, the international members on editorial boards and foreign authorship of papers in Korean journals have increased greatly over the three 5-year periods, and there has been to a certain degree growth in the visibility and performance of Korean SCI journals in terms of impact factors, but not their quartiles."
"This brief communication presents preliminary findings on automated Twitter accounts distributing links to scientific articles deposited on the preprint repository arXiv. It discusses the implication of the presence of such bots from the perspective of social media metrics (altmetrics), where mentions of scholarly documents on Twitter have been suggested as a means of measuring impact that is both broader and timelier than citations. Our results show that automated Twitter accounts create a considerable amount of tweets to scientific articles and that they behave differently than common social bots, which has critical implications for the use of raw tweet counts in research evaluation and assessment. We discuss some definitions of Twitter cyborgs and bots in scholarly communication and propose distinguishing between different levels of engagementthat is, differentiating between tweeting only bibliographic information to discussing or commenting on the content of a scientific work."
"Although the contribution of scientometric literature to policies on academic science has been substantial, the literature has focused primarily on the production of scientific knowledge, whereas limited attention has been paid to the other critical mission of academic institutions, i.e., education or the production of scientists. To address this limitation and better inform policymakers, the current study proposes a new approach drawing on Ph.D. dissertation data, which we believe should open up a new avenue of scientometric research. Integrating dissertation data with more traditional types of scientometric data such as publications and careers, this study presents a case study of the Japanese science system investigating its transition since the 1970s."
"This study content-analyzed scholarly articles on advertising in Asia published in four major journals in advertising and communication from 1990 to 2009. Findings included trends in research output, countries/territories studied, and media covered. Topical, theoretical, and methodological trends in those articles were also identified. Comparisons between the articles published in the 1990s and 2000s were made. Findings and their implications for future studies were discussed."
"We formally review the Author Affiliation Index (AAI) method as originally conceived by David Harless and Robert J. Reilly from the Economics Department at the Virginia Commonwealth University School of Business and as subsequently developed and interpreted by Gorman and Kanet in their 2005 article. Through this formal review, we first highlight and discuss two important informational inputs that can impact the stability of the AAI scores for journals in any given set of to-be-evaluated journals. We then identify and challenge interpretations related to these scores (one theoretical, one statistical) offered by Gorman and Kanet that result in misleading conclusions about journal quality and that may potentially motivate inappropriate editorial behavior. For important professional decisions of hiring, performance evaluation, promotion, and tenure, we conclude by cautioning against sole reliance on the AAI method for ranking journals and against exclusive interpretation of the score computed via the AAI method as an indicator of journal quality."
"Objective: To evaluate scientific papers published by radiologists in high impact general medical journals between 1996 and 2010. Methods: A MEDLINE search was performed in five high impact general medical journals (AIM, BMJ, JAMA, Lancet, and NEJM) for all articles of which a radiologist was the first author between 1996 and 2010. The following information was abstracted from the original articles: radiological subspecialty, imaging technique used, type of research, sample size, study design, statistical analysis, study outcome, declared funding, number of authors, collaboration, and country of the first author. Results: Of 216 (0.19%) articles were published by radiologists in five general medical journals between 1996 and 2010, 83 were original articles. Fifteen (18.1%) original articles were concerned with the field of vascular/interventional radiology, 24 (28.9%) used combined imaging techniques, 76 (91.6%) were clinical research, 63 (75.9%) had a sample size of >50, 65 (78.3%) were prospective, 78 (94.0%) performed statistical analysis, 83 (100%) showed positive study outcomes, 57 (68.7%) were funded, 49 (59.0%) had from four to seven authors, and 79 (95.2%) were collaborative studies. Conclusions: A very small number (0.19%) in five high impact general medical journals was published by radiologists between 1996 and 2010. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved."
"Purpose: To investigate the progress of the Journal of the Balkan Union of Oncology (JBUON) in the second decade of its existence. Methods: We investigated 10 volumes of JBUON, consisting of 42 issues, with regard to the number and category of articles, the contribution of authors from Balkan and non-Balkan countries, and the (co)authorship in published articles. Results: In period 2006-2015, 1407 articles of different categories were published in JBUON. Most were original articles. In 2009, JBUON became listed in Science Citation Index (SCI) database and gained impact factor (IF). After that, the values of some investigated parameters (e.g. submission rate, total number of papers and the number of original articles) correlated with constant rise of the IF value. Conclusion: During the second decade of JBUON the journal has been gradually progressing in regard to the submission rate, the percentage of original papers, contribution of more countries other than Balkan countries, and the number of authors per article. This progress is the consequence of indexing in the SCI list in 2009, and to steadily rise of the IF value."

"Background: Citation classics have been published in almost all medical fields. The main objective of this study was to provide the readers with a complete updated guide using two different citation tracking sources in assessing respiratory literature published in respiratory specific or general medical journals.Methods: Scopus Library database (www.scopus.com) was used to determine the 50 most cited articles regarding respiratory medicine using the subject category respiratory system. The results from the database were sorted using the option Times cited.Results: The top 50 articles were published during the time period 1987-2008, with most articles (n=22) published from 1996 to 2000.The topic that had the highest number of articles (n=15) was chronic obstructive pulmonary disorders (COPD) followed by asthma (n=10).Conclusion: A periodic evaluation of the top cited articles can help researchers identify the quality of work in respiratory system and pinpoint subtopics which have not been given due consideration."
"Media attention to retracted research suggests that a substantial number of papers are corrupted by misinformation. In reality, every paper contains misinformation; at issue is whether the balance of correct versus incorrect information is acceptable. This paper postulates that analysis of retracted research papers can provide insight into medical misinformation, although retracted papers are not a random sample of incorrect papers. Error is the most common reason for retraction and error may be the principal cause of misinformation as well. Still, one-quarter of retracted papers are fraudulent, and misinformation may also arise through fraud. This paper hypothesises that error and fraud are the main sources of misinformation and that error is more common than fraud. Retraction removes misinformation from the literature; bias is non-retracted misinformation. Bias arises when scientific impropriety results in false research findings. Impropriety can involve experimental design, data collection, data analysis, or data presentation. Yet impropriety also arises through earnest error or statistical naivete; not all bias is fraud. Several measures are proposed to minimise misinformation in the medical literature, including: greater detail in the clinical trial registry, with rigorous definition of inclusion and exclusion criteria and primary endpoints; clear statistical criteria for every aspect of clinical trials, especially sample size; responsibility for data integrity that accrues to all named authors; increased transparency as to how the costs of research were paid; and greater clarity as to the reasons for retraction. Misinformation can arise without malicious intent; authors of incorrect papers are owed a presumption of incompetence, not malice."
"Last year, the centenary of the 1916 Easter rising in Ireland was marked by a commemorative programme organised by the Irish government including both historical and cultural events. The main themes of these events were remembering the past, celebrating Irish achievements and imagining our future. Reviewing the medical literature offers an insight into a century of achievement and change in Irish medicine, captured from the unique perspective of Ireland's oldest medical journal. This manuscript examines papers published during the last 100 years of the Irish Journal of Medical Science, specifically examining the most cited paper from each year. The majority of top cited papers originate in Ireland (77%) with Trinity College Dublin the commonest institution (n = 12) and obstetrics the most common specialty (n = 9). The average number of citations per article was 20.56 (SD +/- 22.36; range 1-118) and the article with most citations was 'Coagulative properties of cancers' published in 1958 by O'Meara et al. The mean number of citations for the top cited publication each year has increased over time. The journal continued to publish even amidst backgrounds of war and civil unrest and represents an important cultural artefact that deserves our ongoing support."
"The research question studied in this contribution is how to find an adequate representation to describe the diffusion of scientific ideas over time. We claim that citation data, at least of articles that act as concept symbols, can be considered to contain this information. As a case study we show how the founding article by Nobel Prize winner Mao illustrates the evolution of the field of fiber optics communication. We use a continuous description of discrete citation data in order to accentuate turning points and breakthroughs in the history of this field.

"Higher education institutions are joining many other social entities in shifting how participants are evaluated; work is undergoing increasing analysis through metrics, big data analytics, and related methodologies. As applications of academic metrics expand, new formulations of what is considered as excellence' in teaching and research are being constructed and new kinds of academic star' faculty and journals determined. Academic participation is being tightly coupled with specific, manipulable quantitative measures, providing formidable lessons about how intellectual endeavors are valued. This paper presents analyses of performative metrics' approaches: metrics-related methodologies are being manipulated at levels including faculty member, department, publisher, and university, often in ways well described by game and drama theory (Howard 1994). Academic life is often associated with potentials for unbiased pursuits of knowledge; as discourse intensifies concerning metric manipulation, identities and reputations of academic participants could shift, providing challenges to those who desire trust and impartial merit rewards."
"OBJECTIVE: The relationship between metrics, such as the h-index, and the ability of researchers to generate funding has not been previously investigated in neurosurgery. This study was performed to determine whether a correlation exists between bibliometrics and National Institutes of Health (NIH) funding data among academic neurosurgeons. METHODS: The h-index, m-quotient, g-index, and contemporary h-index were determined for 1225 academic neurosurgeons from 99 (of 101) departments. Two databases were used to create the citation profiles, Google Scholar and Scopus. The NIH Research Portfolio Online Reporting Tools Expenditures and Reports tool was accessed to obtain career grant funding amount, grant number, year of first grant award, and calendar year of grant funding. RESULTS: Of the 1225 academic neurosurgeons, 182 (15%) had at least 1 grant with a fully reported NIH award profile. Bibliometric indices were all significantly higher for those with NIH funding compared to those without NIH funding (P<.001). The contemporary h-index was found to be significantly predictive of NIH funding (P<.001). All bibliometric indices were significantly associated with the total number of grants, total award amount, year of first grant, and duration of grants in calendar years (bivariate correlation, P<.001) except for the association of m-quotient with year of first grant (P = .184). CONCLUSIONS: Bibliometric indices are higher for those with NIH funding compared to those without, but only the contemporary h-index was shown to be predictive of NIH funding. Among neurosurgeons with NIH funding, higher bibliometric scores were associated with greater total amount of funding, number of grants, duration of grants, and earlier acquisition of their first grant."
"Background and Purpose: The aim of this study was to evaluate number and type of Croatian publications in the field of pain research, and to compare it with peers. Material and Methods: The raw data were collected during February 2011 from the three Current Contents (CC) database subsets: Life Sciences, Clinical Medicine, and Social & Behavioral Sciences. We combined two data sets: the one with articles published by authors affiliated with Croatian institutions and the one with pain-related keywords. We studied number of publications, their impact factors and type of collaborations. Publications of Croatian authors in the field of pain research were compared with identical dataset comprising articles published by researchers from Graz, Austria, because of its comparable scientific production. Results: From 1998 to 2011, scientists from Croatian institutions published 194 pain-related articles indexed in CC, compared to 187 articles published by their peels from Graz. The 32% percent of articles were published in the local low-impact journals. The number of Croatian research publications in the field of pain is steadily increasing. However, an average impact factor of journals in our cohort was significantly lower compared to peels from Graz. Conclusion: Although the number of manuscripts in the field of pain research in Croatia is increasing, the quality of published articles is still low. We propose that Croatian Association for the Treatment of Pain should take actions for enhancing pain research in Croatia, as well as increasing the visibility and impact of Croatian pain-related research that can be transposed to other research fields and transitional countries."
"This article conducts a quantitative and qualitative appraisal of the bibliography of financial articles published in 11 Brazilian scientific journals, through surveys into the question of co-authorships and other priority areas, together with an analysis of the productivity of authors. The issue of co-authorships became a dominant feature of the inquiry. The most common areas were corporate finance and investment management, and this reflects the large amount of data supplied by publicly traded companies, although it means that others were neglected. The production of literature is concentrated in the hands of a few people in the South-East of the country and is lower than what was predicted by the bibliometric theory. A large majority of authors only published one article and only 5% published five or more. The international articles of the most prolific authors are largely found in ""low impact"" periodicals. The lack of innovation, either of a theoretical or methodological kind, prevents international publications from having a significant effect. The assessments of seems to stimulate the formation of partnerships, but new incentives are recommended to ensure the level of development is aligned with that of more advanced countries."
"BACKGROUND: A bibliometric uses the citation count of an article to determine its impact on the clinical world. There is a paucity of literature concerning top article citations on spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH). The main objective of this investigation was to bridge this gap and to provide understanding of the trends on the most influential articles written on this subject. METHODS: The Scopus Library database was searched to determine the citations of all articles published on spontaneous ICH. Articles that focused on other forms of ICH, such as trauma-related hemorrhages, subarachnoid hemorrhages, or hemorrhages caused by anticoagulation, vascular malformations, or cavernomas, were excluded from our list. The articles were divided into 2 groups: ""specific"" articles, which focused specifically on spontaneous ICH, and ""generalized"" articles, which were about ICH in general, including spontaneous as well as other forms of ICH. We did not apply any time or study-type restriction in our search. The top 100 cited articles were selected and analyzed by 2 independent investigators. RESULTS: J. Broderick was the author with most publications in the list (n = 21). The largest subset of spontaneous ICH articles was published in the 5-year periods from 1996 to 2000 and 2001 to 2005 (n = 27 each). The United States had the highest number of articles (n = 49). The journal with the highest number of top 100 cited articles was Stroke, with 39, followed by Neurology with 16. CONCLUSIONS: Our study identifies the trends related to spontaneous ICH by analyzing the citation frequency of the most-cited articles in the field."
"The aim of this study is to conduct a retrospective bibliometric analysis of articles about traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) research in PubMed and to learn about the development and perspective of TCM. A systematic bibliometric search was performed based on the PubMed database covering related publications between January 1, 1995, and December 31, 2014. Numbers and type of articles, countries and language of publications, as well as major journals were analyzed in accordance with bibliometrics methodologies. The retrieve results were analyzed and described in the form of texts, tables, and graphs. A total of 42,192 articles were identified from the PubMed database, among which 43.56 % were published as original articles. The articles were originated from 102 countries and territories. China was ranked first with 20,121 articles, followed by United States with 2207 articles. 57.74 % of the articles are published in English. 4364 articles were published by Zhongguo Zhong Yao Za Zhi. And complementary medicine was the most focused research are involving 30,544 articles. The publication activity of TCM literature increased rapidly in the past 20 years, indicating enhanced attention attracted to TCM and more research input. In view of its great advances achieved in scientific studies, TCM will continue to play an important role in medical research."

"This paper aims to investigate the practices of Pakistani academic researchers with respect to using, citing, and publishing their scholarly work. The quantitative survey method adopted to collect data from local researchers was based on an instrument developed and used by CIBER. Their notions and practices involved in deciding trust and quality of scholarly journals were obtained. The findings revealed that national and institutional policies have significantly influenced their decisions regarding the publishing outlets. The credibility of indexing services was found to be an important factor in choosing the journal for publishing research. ISI Web of Science Impact Factor was not considered as the top source for determining quality and trustworthiness. This study is the first of its kind that targets the top two universities of the country. A comparison of the findings with another international study shows that some of the behavioural traits are compatible with scholars from less-developed countries like India and China, while others are more similar to the ones from highly developed countries like USA and UK."

Research limitations/implications - The authors conclude that IMR exhibits the characteristics of a mature and leading journal in the field of international business. To assist IMR in maintaining its significant impact on marketing scholarship, the paper outlines some possible directions for the future. Originality/value - This article analyzes the 29 years of research published in International Marketing Review (IMR) since its inception. To assist IMR in maintaining its significant impact on marketing scholarship, it also outlines some possible directions for the future."
"The main bibliometric databases indicate large differences in country-level scientific publishing productivity, with high growth in many East Asian countries. However, it is difficult to translate country-level publishing productivity to individual-level productivity due to cross-country differences in the size and composition of the research workforce, as well as limited coverage of publications in the social sciences and humanities. Alternative data sources, such as individual-level self-reported publication data, may capture a wider range of publication channels but potentially include non-peer reviewed output and research re-published in different languages. Using individual-level academic survey data across 11 countries, this study finds large differences across countries in individual-level publishing productivity. However, when fractionalised for English-language and peer-reviewed publications, cross-country differences are relatively smaller. This suggests that publishing productivity in certain countries is inflated by a tendency to publish in non-peer reviewed outlets. Academics in large, non-English speaking countries also potentially benefit from a wider range of domestic publication channels. Demographic, motivational and institutional characteristics associated with high individual-level publishing productivity account for part of the publishing productivity differences within and between counties in English-language and peer-reviewed publishing productivity, but not in total publishing productivity where such workforce characteristics only account for within-country differences."
"We report here a simple method to identify the 'emerging topics' in life sciences. First, the keywords selected from MeSH terms on PubMed by filtering the terms based on their increment rate of the appearance, and, then, were sorted into groups dealing with the same topics by 'co-word' analysis. These topics were defined as 'emerging topics'. The survey of the emerging keywords with high increment rates of appearance between 1972 to 2006 showed that emerging topics changed dramatically year by year, and that the major shift of the topics occurred in the late 90s; the topics that cover technical and conceptual aspects in molecular biology to the more systematic '-omics'-related and nanoscience-related aspects. We further investigated trends in emerging topics within various sub-fields in the life sciences."
"A new method for visualizing the relatedness of scientific areas has been developed that is based on measuring the overlap of researchers between areas. It is found that closely related areas have a high propensity to share a larger number of common authors. A method for comparing areas of vastly different sizes and to handle name homonymy is constructed, allowing for the robust deployment of this method on real data sets. A statistical analysis of the probability distributions of the common author overlap that accounts for noise is carried out along with the production of network maps with weighted links proportional to the overlap strength. This is demonstrated on 2 case studies, complexity science and neutrino physics, where the level of relatedness of areas within each area is expected to vary greatly. It is found that the results returned by this method closely match the intuitive expectation that the broad, multidisciplinary area of complexity science possesses areas that are weakly related to each other, whereas the much narrower area of neutrino physics shows very strongly related areas."
"Introduction: The aim of this study was to evaluate and analyze the evolving trends-in endodontic research in 2 leading endodontic journals (ie, Journal of Endodontics and International Endodontic Journal) in articles published from January 2009 to December 2013. The differences in content between this period and a 10-year earlier period from January 1999 to December 2003 were also evaluated. Methods: Each journal's content was accessed through the web edition. For each article, the following parameters were recorded: number of authors, article type, number of affiliations, field of study, source of article, and geographic origin. The recorded data were analyzed using both descriptive and analytic statistics. Results: During 2009-2013 (second period), the mean number of authors per article increased significantly compared with 1999-2003 (first period). The main volume of the literature in both periods and journals was original research articles. The number of published reviews increased significantly from the first to the second study period in contrast to case reports/clinical articles, which presented a significant decrease. ""Endodontic materials"" was the most prevalent thematic category in both study periods. The number of published articles related to ""biology"" and ""chemical preparation and disinfection"" increased significantly from the first to the second study period. On the contrary, the number of articles regarding ""obturation and microleakage"" presented a considerable decrease at the same time. The United States was the leading country in the number of publications in the first period followed by Brazil. In the second period, this rank was reversed with Brazil becoming the leading country followed by the United States. Conclusions: In the last 15 years, the progress of the specialty of endodontology was apparent as shown through the trends and shifts in research orientation in published articles in the 2 leading endodontic journals. The results of the present reviewing process encourage both journals to publish well-designed research projects with a high degree of difficulty, thus contributing to a more evidence-based approach of endodontology."
"The open access (OA) business model has established itself as a viable alternative to traditional subscription-based publishing and is an option that societies should now realistically consider for their journals. This paper outlines how the OA model can work for societies, and presents a number of case studies that demonstrate how it is already working in practice."
"Knowledge, as a prerequisite for development, is contingent on information. The main value of information is in its ability to be used, reused, and shared. Open access (OA) allows for the easy dissemination and preservation of information by providing all scholarly communication and knowledge at no cost to the end user. In the rapidly expanding, global knowledge-based economy, Africa's steady progress from the peripheral to the epicenter of knowledge production is not to be ignored, not least because of its reliance on OA. Such access environments and institutional repositories throughout the continent are playing significant roles in maximizing the impact of research output. This paper reveals that OA content is more citable, not simply because of the quality of the output, but instead of the advantage that OA brings in maximizing accessibility and increased citation. It goes on to show that OA will enhance the research community's existing system for evaluating and rewarding research productivity. Ultimately, OA has the ability to elevate (South) Africa, its universities and institutions, to the status of knowledge producers rather than mere knowledge consumers."
"Peer and panel review are the dominant forms of grant decision-making, despite its serious weaknesses as shown by many studies. This paper contributes to the understanding of the grant selection process through a linguistic analysis of the review reports. We reconstruct in that way several aspects of the evaluation and selection process: what dimensions of the proposal are discussed during the process and how, and what distinguishes between the successful and non-successful applications? We combine the linguistic findings with interviews with panel members and with bibliometric performance scores of applicants. The former gives the context, and the latter helps to interpret the linguistic findings. The analysis shows that the performance of the applicant and the content of the proposed study are assessed with the same categories, suggesting that the panelists actually do not make a difference between past performance and promising new research ideas. The analysis also suggests that the panels focus on rejecting the applications by searching for weak points, and not on finding the high-risk/high-gain groundbreaking ideas that may be in the proposal. This may easily result in sub-optimal selections, in low predictive validity, and in bias."
"Given the growing use of impact metrics in the evaluation of scholars, journals, academic institutions, and even countries, there is a critical need for means to compare scientific impact across disciplinary boundaries. Unfortunately, citation-based metrics are strongly biased by diverse field sizes and publication and citation practices. As a result, we have witnessed an explosion in the number of newly proposed metrics that claim to be ""universal."" However, there is currently no way to objectively assess whether a normalized metric can actually compensate for disciplinary bias. We introduce a new method to assess the universality of any scholarly impact metric, and apply it to evaluate a number of established metrics. We also define a very simple new metric h(s), which proves to be universal, thus allowing to compare the impact of scholars across scientific disciplines. These results move us closer to a formal methodology in the measure of scholarly impact. Published by Elsevier Ltd."
"The fostering of interdisciplinarity is increasingly requested of research organizations. However, conventional approaches to academic research management limit our understanding of the way interdisciplinary research (IDR) centers integrate multiple disciplines. This paper proposes a multilevel approach to explore the patterns of knowledge integration and the forms of research organization emerging from the practices and activities of IDR centers. Several bibliometric-based, network-oriented and visualization-rich approaches are used. The cases of two prominent IDR centers are considered: Harvard University's Wyss Institute and Kyoto University's WPI-iCeMS. At the macro level, our results show similarities in the scientific positioning of both IDR centers, which translate into differences in the nature, intensity and drivers of their knowledge interconnections at the meso-level. At the micro-level, we demonstrate that far from idealizations of full convergence, the realities of IDR centers are characterized by heterogeneous patchworks of multi-trajectory research domains some of these enabling, others generating interdisciplinary knowledge. Differences in knowledge integration occur between but also, and more importantly,, within IDR centers. Thus, tailored strategies tuned to the particularities of organizations and topic-based forms of research organization appear to cope better with interdisciplinary knowledge. The understanding of these inter- and intra-organizational differences proves crucial for effectively fostering knowledge integration. An integrated model relating levels of research management and visualization approaches is proposed for the management and assessment of knowledge integration in IDR centers."
"This study provides an historical analysis of the discipline of information retrieval (IR) for three time periods: 1980-1984, 1990-1994 and 2000-2004. This analysis is done through the use of a novel bibliometric technique called tri-occurrence analysis, in which the descriptor 'information retrieval' is used as a filter term within the traditional technique of co-occurrence analysis. The resulting data is visualized by means of Pathfinder Network analysis. The findings provide evidence of an evolution in the IR landscape over the three decades from an emphasis on systems-, storage- and education-related research in the 1980s to database-, user interface- and information service-related research in the 1990s and to web-related research in the 2000s. This work provides additional validation of the use of tri-occurrence analysis as a useful bibliometric technique."
"In 1963, by invitation, particle physicist George Reynolds (Princeton University) brought an image intensifier to Woods Hole Marine Biological Laboratory. Together, he and a group of biologists began experimenting with the device as a way to create images of cells in low-light level situations, especially in the study of bioluminescence. In this paper I am interested in how the scientists, a physicist and biologists in collaboration, assessed, interpreted and presented the pictures that they created with the aid of image intensification. In particular, I consider the problem of 'noise' in the image. The paper ends with an example of how Reynolds and a biologist at Woods Hole contended with the presence of noise in images used for publication. Here is an example of how data is modified, that is, enhanced, to serve as scientific evidence. By presenting an early and simple case of the altered image I reveal one way scientists addressed the potentiality of presenting inappropriately modified data a concern that has garnered much attention in the current age of digital imaging technologies."
"This paper uses network analysis to measure the position and influence of two prominent academics, James M. Buchanan and Gordon Tullock, founders of Public Choice theory. First, an account of their parallel lives is given. Second, a review of the literature and of the standard centrality measures is provided, insisting on their relevance to assess an author's importance in a given network. Third, detailing the publication records and, overall, co-authorship networks of the two scholars, their respective influence is analyzed through the lens of network analysis. Their academic genealogy is also explored. It is shown in particular that: (1) Buchanan and Tullock's careers followed parallel paths and co-founded Public Choice theory and the journal of the same name, although the two had few common works; (2) though being apparently very similar as to their centrality in the co-authoring network under scrutiny, their ego-networks are structured very differently, revealing diverse positions in the field and, thus, different influence on the discipline."
"The correlation between GDP and research publications is an important issue in scientometrics. This article provides further empirical evidence connecting revealed comparative advantage in national research with effects on economic productivity. Using quantitative time series analysis, this study attempts to determine the nature of causal relationships between research output and economic productivity. One empirical result is that there is mutual causality between research and economic growth in Asia, whereas in Western countries the causality is much less clear. The results may be of use to underdeveloped nations deciding how to direct their academic investment and industry policy."
"This article examines the global and worsening problem of research misconduct as it relates to bio-medico-legal education. While research misconduct has serious legal implications, few adequate legal remedies exist to deal with it. With respect to teaching, research ethics education should be mandatory for biomedical students and physicians. Although teaching alone will not prevent misconduct, it promotes integrity, accountability, and responsibility in research. Policies and law enforcement should send a clear message that researchers should adhere to the highest standards of ethics in research. It is vital that researchers and physicians understand basic aspects of law and the legal system in order to develop understanding of the medico-legal issues not just in the legal context, but with a sound grounding in ethics, social and theoretical contexts so that they can practice good medicine. Routine and holistic research ethics education across the curriculum for medical students and resident physicians, and continuing medical education for practicing doctors, are probably the best ways to accomplish this goal."
"We construct a meta-ranking of 277 economics journals based on 22 different rankings. The ranking incorporates bibliometric indicators from four different databases (Web of Science, Scopus, Google Scholar, and RePEc). We account for the different scaling of the bibliometric indicators by standardizing each ranking score. We run a principal component analysis to assign weights to each ranking. In our meta-ranking, the top five journals are given by: Quarterly Journal of Economics, Journal of Financial Economics, Journal of Economic Literature (JEL), Journal of Finance, and Econometrica. Additionally, leaving out the JEL as a survey journal and the finance journals in our top 10 list we confirm the perceived top five journals in the economics profession."
"We present the findings of a worldwide survey that was administered to business ethic scholars to better understand journal quality within the business ethics academic community. Based upon the data from the survey, we provide a ranking of the top 10 business ethics journals. We then provide a comparison of business ethics journals to other mainstream management journals in terms of journal quality. The results of the study suggest that, within the business ethics academic community, many scholars prefer to publish in the top business ethics academic journals over other mainstream management journals. Furthermore, the results of the study suggest that within the business ethics academic field there are two dominant academic communities: one in Europe and one in North America. Each of these academic communities has its own preferred publication outlets, suggesting a potentially problematic bifurcation of business ethics scholarship."
"This paper proposes the application of the three main Bibliometrics laws-Lotka, Zipf, and Bradford- to address the following questions: (i) How to be sure of the quality of publishers and contents in scholarly publishing, and (ii) How to determine content reliability. Our main goal is to evaluate the visibility of Transinformacao, a Brazilian scholarly journal in the information science area, according to its productivity, citation counts, and performance indicators. This study focusses on the concepts of Bibliometrics and Scholarly Journals, presenting a brief history of scholarly publishing and its accessibility in Brazil, as well as the software tools used in this work. This is an exploratory documentary study, based on descriptive mixed methods (i.e., both qualitative and quantitative), that analyzes 24 years of Transinformacao issues, from its first edition in 1989 to 2011. Descriptive statistics tables are used to show the results obtained from analyses carried out with Publish or perish, Microsoft Excel, and Web of science Citespace tools."
"Beyond explicit reviewer commentary, editors may rely on other metrics when evaluating manuscripts under consideration for publication. One potential, indirect measure of merit may be the ease or difficulty in identifying reviewers willing to review a given paper. We sought to determine whether reviewer decisions to agree or decline to review a manuscript are associated with manuscript acceptance. Original Research submissions to ""Radiology'' from 1/1/2008 to 12/31/2011 were studied. Using Student's t tests, we studied the association between the ratio number-of-reviewers-declining: number-of-reviewers-agreeing to review manuscripts (""decline: agree ratio'') and editor decision to accept or reject the manuscript. A subgroup analysis of papers in which all four invited reviewers agreed to review the paper (""universal agree-to-review group'') was performed. Pearson's correlation was used to study decline: agree ratio and accepted manuscript citation rate. Original Research manuscript acceptance rate at Radiology was 14.5% (780/5375). Decline: agree ratio was similar between accepted and rejected manuscripts (0.87 +/- 0.84 versus 0.90 +/- 0.86 respectively, P = 0.35). ""Universal agree-to-review'' papers were accepted at similar rates to other papers (15.7% [22/140] versus 14.5% [758/5235] respectively, P = 0.69). Higher decline: agree ratios corresponded to lower manuscript citation rates (r = 0.09, P = 0.048). Our study, based on the lack of correlation between agreement to review rate and acceptance rate to Radiology and the direct correlation between agreement to review rate and manuscript citation rate, suggests that reviewers may have a preference for manuscripts with greater potential scientific relevance, but that reviewer motivation to agree to review does not include the expectation of manuscript acceptance."
"Objectives: Medical journals have contributed to the advancement of medicine by helping to disseminate scientific knowledge and providing a forum for medical communities to debate issues in depth. To the authors' knowledge, there are no studies examining the process of medical journal publication in developing Asian countries. The authors analysed the process and costs of publishing medical journals in Sri Lanka, a developing country in South Asia. Methods: Data were collected by interviewing the editors and perusing the records at the editorial offices of the respective medical journals. Articles published in 2009 (or 2008 for journals not published in 2009) were analysed by perusing the respective journals. Results: A total of 44 medical journals were published in Sri Lanka's history, of which only 28 journals remained in publication after 2007. A majority (54%) of the journals published after 2007 were published once per year. Seventeen journals in publication after 2007 were published in paper version only, and 11 journals were also available online. The mean cost of printing one issue was Sri Lankan Rupees (LKR) 97 720 (US$888) (range LKR 28 000-270 000). The cost of distribution ranged from LKR 2000 to 140 000 (US$ 18-1273). The mean cost of publishing one article was LKR 6646 (US$60). A total of 456 articles were published in 2009 (/2008). The total number of pages published was 1723. Conclusion: The infrastructure for medical journal publishing in Sri Lanka has many good qualities such as free access, minimum charges for authors and potential for online availability. The journals are solely academic (non-profit), but the costs remain high."
"Journal-based citations are an important source of data for impact indices. However, the impact of journal articles extends beyond formal scholarly discourse. Measuring online scholarly impact calls for new indices, complementary to the older ones. This article examines a possible alternative metric source, blog posts aggregated at ResearchBlogging.org, which discuss peer-reviewed articles and provide full bibliographic references. Articles reviewed in these blogs therefore receive ""blog citations."" We hypothesized that articles receiving blog citations close to their publication time receive more journal citations later than the articles in the same journal published in the same year that did not receive such blog citations. Statistically significant evidence for articles published in 2009 and 2010 support this hypothesis for seven of 12 journals (58%) in 2009 and 13 of 19 journals (68%) in 2010. We suggest, based on these results, that blog citations can be used as an alternative metric source."
"This paper takes a scientometric approach to examining one of Chinese Interpreting Studies' (CIS) most productive sources of research, MA theses, with the aim of answering the following questions: How has the discipline changed over time? What fields and theories influence it? And what are its most common research themes? The study's comprehensive corpus of nearly 1300 Chinese-language theses addresses a data-based limitation faced by earlier scholars. A range of state-of-the-art statistical techniques have made it possible to detect patterns in CIS that are difficult to tease out by human hand and eye alone. The field has grown rapidly in recent years and is now producing a steady and consistent stream of research: the majority of students in China draw inspiration from theories within Translation Studies, but no particular theories or topics have grown more popular over time. Despite this consistency, CIS remains a complex and dynamic field of academic enquiry."
"As is the case with other fields, there is motivation for studying the impact that the body of evaluation theory literature has within and outside the field. The authors used journal articles written by theorists included on the evaluation theory tree by Alkin and Christie (2004; Christie & Alkin, 2008) and published in the Web of Science, an online academic database, as a data source to address the questions: ""What fields of knowledge do evaluation theorists draw upon in their publications?"" and ""What fields draw upon the published articles of evaluation theorists in their work?"" The bibliometric analysis of 731 journal articles published by evaluation theorists shows that evaluation is an intellectual field that is strongly informed by psychology and education, as well as a range of other subjects. There are some consistencies in the publishing patterns of the theorists across the three branches of the theory tree (methods, use, and valuing), but multidimensional scaling maps show that each branch also exhibits a distinctive character of its own. References to a random sample of 500 articles from a subset of 9 theorists indicate that these theorists were cited not only in the areas that they themselves cite, but also in areas beyond where they routinely publish."
"Objective: This research seeks to understand the publication types and ages cited most often in environmental health literature and the most commonly cited journal titles. Methods: From the 43,896 items cited in Environmental Health Perspectives and the Journal of Environmental Health during 2008-2010, 2 random samples were drawn: First, 1,042 items representing all citations were analyzed with respect to publication type, age, and Internet link. Second, the cited journal name and citation age were recorded for 1,038 items culled from only citations to journal articles. All journal titles were classified into Bradford zones and assigned subject disciplines. Results: Journal articles (n=891, 85.5%) were the most heavily cited publication type. Cited items' publication years ranged from 1951 to 2010. Close to half (49.1%) of all cited items were published 5 or fewer years previous. Sixteen journal titles (3.9%) accounted for 32.5% of all cited journal articles. The 3 most common subject disciplines-""Public, Environmental & Occupational Health,"" ""Environmental Sciences,"" and ""Toxicology""-accounted for 21.6% of all unique journal titles and 45.3% of all citations. Conclusions: Environmental health citation patterns differ from other public health disciplines in terms of cited publication types, cited journals, and age of citations."
"Prior studies showed that scientists' professional networks contribute to research productivity, but little work has examined what factors predict the formation of professional networks. This study sought to 1) examine what factors predict the formation of international ties between faculty and graduate students and 2) identify how these international ties would affect publication productivity in three East Asian countries. Face-to-face surveys and indepth semi-structured interviews were conducted with a sample of faculty and doctoral students in life sciences at 10 research institutions in Japan, Singapore, and Taiwan. Our final sample consisted of 290 respondents (84 faculty and 206 doctoral students) and 1,435 network members. We used egocentric social network analysis to examine the structure of international ties and how they relate to research productivity. Our findings suggest that overseas graduate training can be a key factor in graduate students' development of international ties in these countries. Those with a higher proportion of international ties in their professional networks were likely to have published more papers and written more manuscripts. For faculty, international ties did not affect the number of manuscripts written or of papers published, but did correlate with an increase in publishing in top journals. The networks we examined were identified by asking study participants with whom they discuss their research. Because the relationships may not appear in explicit co-authorship networks, these networks were not officially recorded elsewhere. This study sheds light on the relationships of these invisible support networks to researcher productivity."
"In the current discussions concerning the pressure for publication and to obtain grants, the questions about what publication and grant pressure actually involve and how they are linked to the academic job market, are often neglected. In this study, we show that publication and grand pressure are not just external forces but internal ones as scientists apply pressure to themselves in the process of competition. Through two surveys, one of 1,133 recent PhDs at five Dutch universities and one of 225 postdoctoral researchers at two Dutch universities, we found that publication and grant pressure have to be considered in relation with competition for academic jobs. While publication and grant pressure are perceived to be too high by a majority of these early career researchers, the effects of publication and grant pressure by themselves are limited."
"We study the diffusion of techniques designed to identify causal relationships in corporate finance research. We estimate that the diffusion started in the mid-1990s, lagged 20 years compared to economics, and is now used in the majority of corporate finance articles. Consistent with recent theories of technology diffusion, the adoption varies across researchers based on individuals' expected net benefits of adoption. Younger scholars, holders of PhDs in economics, and those working at top institutions adopt faster. Adoption is accelerated through networks of colleagues and alumni and is also facilitated by straddlers who cross over from economics to finance. Our findings highlight new forces that explain the diffusion of innovation and shape the norms of academic research."
"Objective: Peer reviewers sometimes request that authors cite their work, either appropriately or via coercive self-citation to highlight the reviewers' work The objective of this study was to determine in peer reviews submitted to one biomedical journal (1) the extent of peer reviewer self-citation; (2) the proportion of reviews recommending revision or acceptance versus rejection that included reviewer self-citations; and (3) the proportion of reviewer self-citations versus citations to others that included a rationale. Methods: Peer reviews for manuscripts submitted in 2012 to the Journal of Psychosomatic Research were evaluated. Data extraction was performed independently by two investigators. Results: There were 616 peer reviews (526 reviewers; 276 manuscripts), of which 444 recommended revision or acceptance and 172 rejection. Of 428 total citations, there were 122 peer reviewer self-citations (29%) and 306 citations to others' work (71%). Self-citations were more common in reviews recommending revision or acceptance (105 of 316 citations; 33%) versus rejection (17/112; 15%; p < 0.001). The percentage of self-citations with no rationale (26 of 122; 21%) was higher than for citations to others' work (15 of 306; 5%; p <0.001). Conclusions: Self-citation in peer reviews is common and may reflect a combination of appropriate citation to research that should be cited in published articles and inappropriate citation intended to highlight the work of the peer reviewer. Providing instructions to peer reviewers about self-citation and asking them to indicate when and why they have self-cited may help to limit self-citation to appropriate, constructive recommendations.

"Objective: The purpose of our study was to evaluate Slovenia's contribution to research in ophthalmology over a period of 18 years (1991 2009) including not only ophthalmologists but also other researchers. The aim of the study was to determine the relative contribution, quantitatively and qualitatively, to research in ophthalmology and to determine the trend over the period. The first authors as well as their institutes were evaluated. Methods: A bibliometric analysis was performed using the database of the Institute for Scientific Information (IS!) 2007 report. All articles published in the top 45 ophthalmology journals listed in the ISI 2007 report were analysed. Results: A total of 187170 articles have been published in these journals in the given period of time. Slovenia's ophthalmologists and other researchers published 75 articles or 0.040% of all publications. The articles were published in 21 of the 45 listed journals. Two were excluded from the study because they were only abstracts. In 8 articles the first author was not a Slovenian ophthalmologist. At the end, 65 articles remained in the study. 22 different Slovenian ophthalmologists were found as first author among these journals. Comparing ophthalmologists and other researchers, ophthalmologists produced 57 from 65 articles or 87.69%. 13 from 22 ophthalmologists had published only one paper, accounting for 22.8% (13 of 57) of total first authors. There were 47 articles with one or more co-authors (82.5%) and 10 papers with a single author, which represent 17.5% of total papers. There was only one first author who issued more than 10 articles (13 from 57 or 22.8%). All the contribution came from two university clinical centres, Ljubljana (27 articles or 47.37%) and Maribor (30 articles or 52.63%). Three authors contributed to 45.6% of all papers. Two-thirds of articles were published in English and one-third in German language. Conclusions: Although the number of articles published by Slovenia's ophthalmologists is increasing over the last 8 years there is a need to increase the quality and quantity of clinical research in ophthalmology and to involve more ophthalmologists in research work to support these trends."
"Citation measures, and newer altmetric measures such as downloads are now commonly used to inform personnel decisions. How well do or can these measures measure or predict the past, current, or future scholarly performance of an individual? Using data from the Smithsonian/NASA Astrophysics Data System we analyze the publication, citation, download, and distinction histories of a cohort of 922 individuals who received a U.S. PhD in astronomy in the period 1972-1976. By examining the same and different measures at the same and different times for the same individuals we are able to show the capabilities and limitations of each measure. Because the distributions are lognormal, measurement uncertainties are multiplicative; we show that in order to state with 95% confidence that one person's citations and downloads are significantly higher than another person's, the log difference in the ratio of counts must be at least 0.3dex, which corresponds to a multiplicative factor of 2."
"In recent years, collaborations between scholars have drastically increased in all fields. Using individual and country collaboration data from the past 30 years, this paper studies the evolution and trend of collaboration networks in the field of information systems. Our research shows that individual scholars and all countries display the ""long tail"" phenomenon in article publishing. Average collaboration degree and co-authorship ratio of articles over time are on the rise overall. Evolutionary analysis of collaboration networks manifest that the network development is basically mature although it has not yet reached a stable status. International collaborations have shown a gradual increase, with the increase in participating countries distributed mainly in Europe and Asia and increase in collaborations mainly in North America and Europe, especially the United States, England and Canada."
"This research examines criteria for evaluating the impact of publications in open access and the influence of this philosophy in enhancing the impact in scientific publications. The research corpus consisted of documents listed in the Open Access Citation Advantage annotated bibliography. Several conclusions can be drawn from results: a) The adoption or acceptance of open access publications becomes a phenomenon associated with the scientific culture of each discipline; b) The scientific culture and the characteristics of the discipline also determine how citations are made: in this case it is the degree of knowledge obsolescence in each subject driving this process; c) Citations are more closely linked to the quality of the content of the publication rather than to degree of accessibility; and d) The alleged visibility of open access publications, at least with regard to the corpus of this research, cannot be strongly linked to the increased impact of publications."
"Citation is a universally acknowledged way for scientific impact evaluation. However, due to its easy manipulability, simply relying on citation cannot objectively reflect the actual impact of scholars. Instead of citation, we utilize the academic networks, in virtue of their available and abundant academic information, to evaluate the scientific impact of scholars in this paper. Through the collaboration among scholars in academic networks, we notice an interesting phenomenon that scholars in some special positions can access more kinds of information and connect researchers from different groups to promote the scientific collaborations. However, this important fact is generally ignored by the existing approaches. Motivated by the observations above, we propose the novel method AIRank to evaluate the scientific impact of scholars. Our method not only considers the impact of scholars through the mutual reinforcement process in heterogeneous academic networks, but also integrates the structural holes theory and information entropy theory to depict the benefit that scholars obtain via their positions in the network. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of AIRank in evaluating the impact of scholars more comprehensively and finding more top ranking scholars with interdisciplinary nature."
"The power-law distribution and the Garfield's Law of Concentration of journal citation have long been verified by empirical data. As a relatively new type of reference, the URL references are cited more and more frequently in the scientific papers and their distribution is proved to fit for the Garfield's Law of Concentration too. In this article, we collect three URL references datasets extracted from papers written by researchers belonging to three big research groups : Chinese Academy of Sciences, Max Planck Institute, and the whole Chinese scientific researchers. Through the curve-fitting with SPSS and contrast the results with the judgment standard of power-law distribution, we verify that there also exists power-law distribution in the citation frequency of hostnames in these three URL references datasets. And our experimental results show that the range of power exponent in the journal references and the URL references are different. Started from the concrete empirical procedures and the final experimental results, we analyze four factors that may lead to this difference between journal references and URL references: the sample size, the sampling method, the concentration of citation and the type property of citation."
"The lack of an integrated information policy for scientific activity evaluation has led to a wide range of information products and services that are used for such purposes, although they were not originally designed for that. While it is true that these tools have limitations and deficiencies, and in several cases are technologically and methodologically obsolete, possibly the biggest problem is sustainability in the present times of economic crisis, especially if they do not take on new strategic tasks, such as assessment, which is a priority today. Various products are reviewed in this critical essay: scientific journal portals, with the recommendation to implement value added systems like SciELO instead of simple database management; current databases on offer, with questions about having national products without metrics; institutional repositories, with the observation that they have forgotten to serve authors, their real end users; and institutional ranking systems, suggesting that some have not learned from the successes of those based on composite indicators. Recommendations include institutional coordination of services; professionalism versus incompetence; and an end to the economic drain caused both by licensing underused databases and by maintaining outdated policies based on criteria that have been abandoned at the international level."
"Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to see whether it is possible to reliably detect, prospectively, superior intellectual contributions to marketing's literature. Design/methodology/approach - Citation data accessed on the Institute of Scientific Information Web of Science were used to examine the impact of award-winning marketing articles with those of lead articles and non-lead articles in the same journal issues. Findings - Award-winners gathered more citations than those for the two comparison groups. It is shown, however, that this finding should not be taken for granted. The peer review system frequently fails to identify high quality, innovative research. Research limitations/implications - The paper only considers US marketing journals. Originality/value - This is the only in-depth study of the impact of award-winning research in the marketing community."
"We examine the characteristics of 663 Open Access (OA) journals in biology, computer science, economics, history, medicine, and psychology, then compare the OA journals with impact factors to comparable subscription journals. There is great variation in the size of OA journals; the largest publishes more than 2,700 articles per year, but half publish 25 or fewer. While just 29 percent of OA journals charge publication fees, those journals represent 50 percent of the articles in our study. OA journals in the fields of biology and medicine are larger than the others, more likely to charge fees, and more likely to have a high citation impact. Overall, the OA journal landscape is greatly influenced by a few key publishers and journals."
"The archaeological excavation works developed at the site of Santa Maria de Abajo (Carranque, Toledo) between 2009 and 2011 - focused on the space occupied by the Late Roman Palace-have allowed us to know a long occupational sequence developed between Roman times and the early years of 20th century. In this work we present the study of ceramic contexts associated with the Emirate levels."
'Many physicists see the interface with biology as an exciting place to be'. Athene Donald provides a personal perspective on working at the interface between the physical and biological sciences.
"Author self-citations are another factor that affects the impact factor of a journal. Typically these self-citations are just counted as such. But to be more meaningful I suggest that when examining the contribution of authors' self-citations to impact factors one should first count the number of citations in the text rather than in the reference list, and then discriminate between different kinds of author self-citations-from those that are informative to those that are self-enhancing-if these data are to be more credible."
"Citation analyses are based on two questionable assumptions that significantly influence the value of citation count: the equal contribution assumption (i.e., each citation contributes equally to the citing paper) and the positive endorsement assumption (i.e., each citation is viewed as an endorsement from the citing paper to the cited work). This study employed a citation context analysis approach to examine the distributions of essential versus perfunctory citations as well as confirmative versus negational citations in humanities and social sciences (H&SS) research articles to determine to what extent the two problematic assumptions affect the validity of citation analyses in those fields. The sample comprises 360 articles representing six subject areas: Chinese literature, history, arts (i.e., the humanities subjects); sociology, economics, and psychology (i.e., the social sciences subjects). Excluding citations to primary sources-e.g., manuscripts, archival materials, monographs that were the subjects of study rather than information sources, a total of 25,617 in-text bibliographic citations were analyzed. The findings show that the distributions of citation functions for those six subject fields were all significantly different, meaning that disciplinary differences exist in H&SS citations. Also, for the H&SS fields, perfunctory citations may have inflated the contribution of the cited works much more than negational citations."
"Scientists may encounter many collaborators of different academic ages throughout their careers. Thus, they are required to make essential decisions to commence or end a creative partnership. This process can be influenced by strategic motivations because young scholars are pursuers while senior scholars are normally attractors during new collaborative opportunities. While previous works have mainly focused on cross-sectional collaboration patterns, this work investigates scientific collaboration networks from scholars' local perspectives based on their academic ages. We aim to harness the power of big scholarly data to investigate scholars' academic-age-aware collaboration patterns. From more than 621,493 scholars and 2,646,941 collaboration records in Physics and Computer Science, we discover several interesting academic-age-aware behaviors. First, in a given time period, the academic age distribution follows the long-tail distribution, where more than 80% scholars are of young age. Second, with the increasing of academic age, the degree centrality of scholars goes up accordingly, which means that senior scholars tend to have more collaborators. Third, based on the collaboration frequency and distribution between scholars of different academic ages, we observe an obvious homophily phenomenon in scientific collaborations. Fourth, the scientific collaboration triads are mostly consisted with beginning scholars. Furthermore, the differences in collaboration patterns between these two fields in terms of academic age are discussed."
"The research output of countries is among the indicators that help us understand the dynamics of science. Increasingly, these dynamics have been marked by changes in scientific communication. Researchers' attitudes toward open science, alternative models of publication and toward originality are among the elements shaping the current scientific landscape. This changing panorama reflects on the attitude of authors, editors and publishers toward the correction of the literature, a practice that is encountered to different extents in different fields. This practice may suggest, among several issues, commitment of the scientific community to boosting the reliability of the research record. Would the research output of countries have any association with this panorama? We analyzed 1623 retractions issued in 2013-2015 and discussed in Retraction Watch (RW), www.retractionwatch.com. These retractions account for a considerable fraction of the total of retraction notices in PubMed in the same period. They were categorized by reason, field and country (that of the corresponding author). These retractions were distributed among 71 countries, with 15 countries accounting for a major share (85%)-most of those with the largest number of publications in the Scimago Journal & Country Rank (SJR). However, there is no consistent pattern for the relationship between ranking in SJR and ranking in number of retractions across countries in our RW dataset, which is skewed mostly by the fact that the RW website tends to post newsworthy retractions, with a bias toward biomedical and clinical sciences. This caveat notwithstanding, the prevalence of the most productive countries in our dataset of retractions is worth noting. Gradually, retractions have been permeating the dynamics of research productivity in many countries but, so far, there is limited knowledge of this interaction. We believe it should be further explored."
"Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to compare the performance of the supply chain management and logistics (SCML) strategy journals recently added to the Web of Science database to the performance of journals from other business disciplines also recently admitted to the Web of Science database on the Thomson Reuters selection process criteria. Design/methodology/approach - A benchmarking approach is used to examine the relative performance of SCML journals over a two-year period. Findings - The two sets of journals' publishing standards and the number of citations for authors from the two groups are quite similar. Journals in the benchmark group had greater international diversity and balance among their authors, editors and editorial boards, while the SCML journals were cited more often in Web of Science and had lower self-citation rates. Research limitations/implications - This study required a great deal of counting, and some of the data were collected multiple times to check for accuracy. Still, it is possible that mistakes were made. Data from different years and different authors may have yielded different results. Practical implications - The recent addition of six journals to the Web of Science database allows leading SCML journals to compete on a level playing field with other top-tier business journals and can therefore be regarded as a major step forward in the maturation of the discipline, as well as recognition of the quality of the journals. Originality/value - The authors' benchmarking study extends previous examinations of SCML journals relative to leading journals in other business fields, and offers direction for how Sail, researchers and journal editors can continue to contribute to the maturation of the discipline."
"Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to measure the degree of interdisciplinary collaboration in Big Data research based on the co-occurrences of subject categories using Stirling's diversity index and specialization index. Design/methodology/approach - Interdisciplinarity was measured utilizing the descriptive statistics of disciplines, network indicators showing relationships between disciplines and within individual disciplines, interdisciplinary communities, Stirling's diversity index and specialization index, and a strategic diagram revealing the development status and trends of discipline communities. Findings - Comprehensively considering all results, the degree of interdisciplinarity of Big Data research is increasing over time, particularly, after 2013. There is a high level of interdisciplinarity in Big Data research involving a large number of disciplines, but it is unbalanced in distribution. The interdisciplinary collaborations are not intensive on the whole; most disciplines are aggregated into a few distinct communities with computer science, business and economics, mathematics, and biotechnology and applied microbiology as the core. Four major discipline communities in Big Data research represent different directions with different development statuses and trends. Community 1, with computer science as the core, is the most mature and central to the whole interdisciplinary network. Accounting for all network indicators, computer science, engineering, business and economics, social sciences, and mathematics are the most important disciplines in Big Data research. Originality/value - This study deepens our understanding of the degree and trend of interdisciplinary collaboration in Big Data research through a longitudinal study and quantitative measures based on two indexes. It has practical implications to study and reveal the interdisciplinary phenomenon and characteristics of related developments of a specific research area, or to conduct comparative studies between different research areas."
"Editors have a responsibility to retract seriously flawed articles from their journals. However, there appears to be little consistency in journals' policies or procedures for this. In a qualitative study, we therefore interviewed editors of science journals using semi-structured interviews to investigate their experience of retracting articles. We identified potential barriers to retraction, difficulties in the process and also sources of support and encouragement. Our findings have been used as the basis for guidelines developed by the Committee on Publication Ethics."
"There is an increased focus on the outcomes of Health Science PhD-education, particularly if PhD-graduates remain active in research. There is a gap in our knowledge about the extent the investment in Health Science PhDs is moving science forward and no definition of expected investment return from PhD exists. We explore the research production of Danish Health Science PhDs, 5-9 years post PhD-defence, to find the fraction of PhD-graduates that are still actively publishing internationally. Secondary endpoints include analyses of the number of publications over time, identification of consecutive publishers, gender differences, and differences between medical doctors with a PhD (MDs) and non-MDs with a PhD. PhD-theses defended in 2005 and 2006 were identified and collected using the Danish National Research Database and via the four Danish universities offering Health Science PhD-programmes. Publication data were collected from Years 5 to 9 post PhD-defence to allow publications produced during the PhD-period to be washed out. Total 532 unique PhD-graduates (300 female and 232 male) produced a total of 4,530 PubMed-indexed publications. Results show zero publishers represented 31.2% (n = 166), while 25.8% (n = 137) of PhD-graduates published 10 or more publications during the 5-year observation window. Overall publication count increased from post PhD Years 5-9 with 68% (from 720 to 1,049). Number of publications did not differ between MDs and non-MDs. Our results evidence that not all graduates continue in research. Consequently, we need to identify early factors that make graduates remain in research, to identify future PhD-candidates that will continue publication post PhD."
In this discussion we prepare performance trajectories using CWTS Leiden 2018 data to show that leading research universities in the EU members from the post-communist grouping still lag considerably behind developed EU-15 members of comparable size.
"Although the subject of ranking higher education institutions is frequently elaborated in many research papers, consensus about a leading ranking methodology has not been reached yet. Consequently, different methodologies are based on rather conflicting indicators and therefore often provide highly diverse rankings of the world's best universities. For instance, SCImago Institutions Rankings (SIR) methodology is exclusively based on indicators of scientific output, while Times Higher Education World University Rankings (THE) and Quacquarelli Symonds World University Rankings (QS) take into account the teaching dimension of the university performance to a large degree. To explore the impact of different methodologies further, we first obtained data on Asian best-ranked universities according to SIR, THE and QS methodologies. The aim of this article is to explore possibilities to enhance ranking methodologies using I-distance method. The result was manifold: first, by employing our I-distance approach we were able to point out potential weaknesses of subjectively chosen weighting factors of THE and QS ranking methodologies. Secondly, we were able to provide detailed information on how each QS and THE indicator contributes to the final rank and emphasize the crucial indicators in the process of ranking. Thirdly, SIR does not provide the total score and its appropriate rank; and using our approach not only did we provide the total score but also determined the relative significance of each compounding SIR indicator. One of the contributions lies in the use of the I-distance method, which can easily integrate variables with different measurement units into one composite indicator. Moreover, our approach could be a foundation for impartial framework of universities' assessment, independent of subjectively formed weighting factors. Finally, a special overview of university performances of leading Indian universities is provided."
"Purpose - This study aims to analyse the geographical distribution of global research activities and to investigate the knowledge diffusion embodied in scientific papers. Design/methodology/approach -The geographical summary of Frontiers articles displays the number of visits and categorizes where the visitors hail from. This study uses the records of 23,798 articles published in 16 Frontiers journals from 2007 to 2015 to analyse the geographical distribution of article visits at both country and city levels. The process of knowledge diffusion is investigated on the basis of the different visiting patterns of new and old papers. Findings - Most article visits are concentrated around major metropolitan areas and some high-tech clusters. The top ""visiting countries"" include both developed countries and developing countries, and the USA and China are two major players. Publishing cities dominate article visits for new papers; as time passes, there is diffusion from the publishing cities to a broader area. Research limitations/implications - The data on visiting for open access articles may be generated from various repositories besides the publishers' websites; these data are ignored, as they are not significant enough to have much influence. There is also a lack of a basic theory in the data processing of outliers in the data set. In addition, only static results are given in this paper, as the data were collected on one day, for one time. A longer time period is necessary to track the dynamic diffusion process of the observations. Practical implications - Introduction of usage data will propose a novel way to analyse research activities and track knowledge diffusion. Social implications - The visiting data of articles offer a new way to investigate research activities at the city level in a detailed and timely manner, for the geographical distribution of research activities and the research resource allocation of a specific country to be explored. Originality/value - This study measured the research activities of scientific papers by examining the usage data. Compared with previous studies that focused on the geographical distribution of scientific activities using publication data, citation data and even altmetrics data, usage data are at the forefront of this research. Therefore, usage data offer a fresh perspective on methodology, providing more detailed and real-time information."
"We present a comparative study of four impact measures: the h-index, the g-index, the R-index and the j-index. The g-index satisfies the transfer principle, the j-index satisfies the opposite transfer principle while the h- and R-indices do not satisfy any of these principles. We study general inequalities between these measures and also determine their maximal and minimal values, given a fixed total number of citations. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."
"The visibility of an article depends to a large extent on its authors. We study the question how each co-author's relative contribution to the visibility of the article can be determined and quantified using an indicator, referring to such an indicator as a CAV-indicator. A two-step procedure is elaborated, whereby one first chooses an indicator (e.g. total number of citations, h-index aEuro broken vertical bar) and subsequently one of two possible approaches. The case where the indicator is an h-type index is elaborated in a Lotkaian framework. Different examples illustrate the procedure and the choices involved in determining a CAV-indicator."
"The factors that foster successful scientific collaboration and teamwork have been studied extensively. However, these factors have been studied in isolation and it is not clear to what extent one factor is more relevant than other in the formation of research groups. In this work we propose a new methodology based on network analysis to simultaneously evaluate multiple factors considered relevant in the conformation of formal research groups. Our methodology is supported on structural, statistical, and correlation analysis. In addition to validating our methodology with a case study at a research-teaching university, we introduce a new network to represent the success of scientific collaboration that produces the best prediction in group formation. Our methodology and the results obtained can be used for organising researchers in a university that seeks to strengthen its research strategy."
"This study replicates the method of identifying core journals in the field of communication disorders published in the January 2001 issue of Library Resources and Technical Services for the purpose of determining the degree to which the ranked list changed after ten years. Two measures are used to assess the reliability of rankings over time: Spearman's rho rank correlations among the citing journals and coefficients of variation among cited journals. Rank correlations of groups of journals can mask important changes in rank for individual titles, so characteristics of the journals with the greatest movements in rank over a decade are explored. Major findings are that the discipline's literature grew substantially over the decade, and the core journals remained stable over ten years (r(s) = 0.73). However, despite stability of core journals over time, some titles changed dramatically in rank. Coefficients of reliability calculated for this group of communication disorders journals suggests that approximately one-third of observed change in ranks is because of random variability in works cited."
"This study describes the basic methodological approach and the results of URAP-TR, the first national ranking system for Turkish universities. URAP-TR is based on objective bibliometric data resources and includes both size-dependent and size-independent indicators that balance total academic performance with performance per capita measures. In the context of Turkish national university rankings, the paper discusses the implications of employing multiple size-independent and size-dependent indicators on national university rankings. Fine-grained ranking categories for Turkish universities are identified through an analysis of ranking results across multiple indicators."
"The excessive amount of digital information has made it crucial to extract the relevant information. This hinders researchers in finding documents pertaining to their research. There exist various state-of-the-art techniques, such as co-citation, bibliographic coupling, and their recent extensions like citation proximity analysis and citation order analysis, that recommend the relevant documents against the posed query. Most of these approaches are statistical in nature and thus can further be extended by incorporating some semantics to enhance the results. In this paper, we present an extension of a co-citation-based technique to identify the most relevant documents to co-cited document(s). The proposed system explores in-text citation frequencies and in-text citation patterns of co-cited documents within the different logical sections of cited-by papers. Furthermore, we have evaluated the proposed approach with the co-citation approach and citation proximity analysis (CPA) approach on a dataset acquired from CiteSeer. The outcomes revealed that most of the time the proposed approach outperformed other state-of-the-art techniques. The average correlation of the proposed approach is increased by 68% as compared to the co-citation-based approach. In comparison with CPA approach, the average correlation of the proposed approach is increased by 39% with respect to gold-standard rankings."
"The present study tended to investigate the sustainability of citation advantage of author-pays hybrid open access journals. Applying a comparative citation analysis method, it explored a sample consisted of 160,168 articles in 47 Elsevier APC-funded hybrid open access journals published in the periods 2007-2011 and 2012-2015. Two citation windows were selected in the study: one ranging from the journals' publication years until 2013 (obtained from Sotudeh et al. in Scientometrics 104(2):581-608, 2015), and another ranging from the journals' publication years until 2016 (data collection date in the present study). The comparative citation analysis of the older articles (published in 2007-2011) in the two mentioned citation windows indicated that they sustained their citation advantage in comparison with the toll-access ones. The citation advantage was also confirmed for more recent APC-funded OA articles (published in 2012-2015). Therefore, the passage of time did not seem to affect the citation gap between APC-funded OA and toll-access articles, and the citation advantage of the APC-funded OA articles was apparently a sustainable phenomenon. Moreover, the number of the APC-funded OA articles increased in comparison with that of the toll-gated articles. In addition, the APC-funded OA articles exhibited citation advantages in almost all fields."
"Owing to conceptual and technical problems, the Journal Impact Factor is not a valid measure of a journal article's quality. Still, it is employed because it can easily replace the assessment of content and promises objectivity as well as comparability. It will continue to be used as long as it can serve as a pseudo solution sciences for increasingly frequent evaluation problems particularly in the life, sciences. There is some hope that the emerging movement against the use of Journal Impact Factors grows faster than first attempts to use them in sociology."
"Bibliometricians face several issues when drawing and analyzing samples of citation records for their research. Drawing samples that are too small may make it difficult or impossible for studies to achieve their goals, while drawing samples that are too large may drain resources that could be better used for other purposes. This paper considers three common situations and offers advice for dealing with each. First, an entire population of records is available for an institution. We argue that, even though all records have been collected, the use of inferential statistics, significance testing, and confidence intervals is both common and desirable. Second, because of limited resources or other factors, a sample of records needs to be drawn. We demonstrate how power analyses can be used to determine in advance how large the sample needs to be to achieve the study's goals. Third, the sample size may already be determined, either because the data have already been collected or because resources are limited. We show how power analyses can again be used to determine how large effects need to be in order to find effects that are statistically significant. Such information can then help bibliometricians to develop reasonable expectations as to what their analysis can accomplish. While we focus on issues of interest to bibliometricians, our recommendations and procedures can easily be adapted for other fields of study. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."
"In 2008 Meier and Conkling first tested Google Scholar's coverage of the engineering literature against citations gathered from the Compendex database. Since that time, other studies have used the same methodology and found improvement in Google Scholar's coverage. This study uses engineering dissertations from Proquest Dissertations & Theses to create a data set of citations for the comparison of fee-based databases, Compendex and Scopus, against Google Scholar. From 1950 to 2017 Google Scholar outperformed both Compendex and Scopus in discoverability of citations in nine engineering subjects. These results have implications for collection management and information literacy program planning for librarians."
"The research in obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) may be beneficial from the collaboration between countries and researchers. In this study, we aimed to analyze the scientific research on OSA from 1991 to 2012 and to evaluate the collaboration networks between countries. We conducted a bibliometric study in the SCOPUS database. The systematic search was limited to ""articles"" published from 1991 to 2012. Articles are results of original research; we evaluated the following criteria: number of countries represented, number of authors, number of citations, and journal names. We determined which countries were the most productive (more articles published) and the number of collaborations between these countries. The probability of citation was evaluated using adjusted odds ratios in a logistic regression analysis. We found a total of 6,896 OSA-related articles that had been published in 1,422 journals, 50 % of these articles were concentrated in 41 journals. Of the 74 different countries associated with these articles, the USA had the highest involvement with 23.8 % of all articles published. The probability of citation increased by 1.23 times for each additional author, and by 2.23 times for each additional country represented; these findings were independent of time since publication, journal, or the country of the author. Scientific production on OSA is increasing with limited international collaboration. The country with the greatest production in this period (1991-2012) was the USA, which concentrated the international collaboration network on OSA. We recommended that articles should be produced with international collaboration to improve the quantity of scientific publications and their chances of publication in high impact journals."
"This article explores the role and value of the academic journal publisher as paradigms of Open Access gain momentum and challenge the standards of paid subscription models. To recover the costs of publication services (which include everything from printing copies to online hosting and protection of intellectual property rights), publishers have traditionally employed a model in which subscribing individuals or institutions pay for access to content. The two main versions of Open Access publishing currently at largeGold (in which a funding body or person pays the publisher to make the content freely available) and Green (in which there are no payments made for publication and articles are archived in free public repositories)pose a challenge to the user-pays models that have served as a foundation of the business since its inception. However, these changes do not portend an undermining of the importance or viability of the academic journal publisher."
"An overview is provided of CSIC's research performance in the context of Spain, through a study of its scholarly production in the Web of Science database, complemented with ICYT and ISOC, during the period 2004-2009. The eight scientific and technical areas in which CSIC's centers are organised differ as to their national or international research orientation, their basic or applied nature, the degree of their collaboration and the size of their research teams; all of which influences each area's publication and citation practices as well as its WoS-based productivity. The specific features of the different areas must be thoroughly understood in order to expound on and interpret properly the results of studies dealing with research evaluation."
"Published medical research influences health care providers and policy makers, guides patient management, and is based on the peer review process. Peer review should prevent publication of unreliable data and improve study reporting, but there is little evidence that these aims are fully achieved. In the blinded systems, authors and readers do not know the reviewers' identity. Moreover, the reviewers' reports are not made available to readers. Anonymous peer review poses an ethical imbalance toward authors, who are judged by masked referees, and to the medical community and society at large, in case patients suffer the consequences of acceptance of flawed manuscripts or erroneous rejection of important findings. Some general medical journals have adopted an open process, require reviewers to sign their reports, and links online pre-publication histories to accepted articles. This system increases editors' and reviewers' accountability and allows public scrutiny, consenting readers understand on which basis were decisions taken and by whom. Moreover, this gives credit to reviewers for their apparently thankless job, as online availability of signed and scored reports may contribute to researchers' academic curricula. However, the transition from the blind to the open system could pose problems to journals. Reviewers may be more difficult to find, and publishers or medical societies could resist changes that may affect editorial costs and journals' revenues. Nonetheless, also considering the risk of competing interests in the medical field, general and major specialty journals could consider testing the effects of open review on manuscripts regarding studies that may influence clinical practice.

"Open-access journals, in which the authors pay a publication fee, have an incentive to publish a high volume of articles. This letter explores the matter of conflict of interest in the growing number of these journals. To the Editor: The Perspective articles by Wolpert, Frank, Carroll, and Haug (Feb. 28 issue)(1)-(4) address both the problems that are raised by open-access journals and the potential value of this alternative publishing model. Open-access journals are those that participate in any publication arrangement in which content is available to readers online, in digital form, generally without charge or copyright restriction. Readers can search databases without paying a fee and can lawfully read, print, further distribute, and cite the full text of copyrighted literature, licensed literature, or both. In the most common arrangement, authors pay to publish and retain ..."
"There is for a scientific journal several levels of communication depending of the degree of suspicion or certainty of a case of error or fraud. The task is increasingly difficult for journal editors as disclosed cases of fraud ore more common and scientific communication on this topic is growing. Biomedical fraud is fairly little reported by the mainstream press and causes of this low interest are not currently well understood. The difficulty of processing this type of news for journalists appears to be one possible reason. The potentially numerous and significant consequences of fraud on health professionals are poorly documented. Though it is likely to cause a feeling of distrust and create controversy, the impact of fraud on the general public is poorly studied and appears multifactorial."
"Science studies have not yet provided a conceptual scheme that distinguishes creative accomplishments from other research contributions. Likewise, there is no commonly agreed typology capturing all important manifestations of innovative science. This article takes up these two desiderata. We argue that scientific creativity springs from the fundamental tension between originality and scientific relevance. Based on this consideration, we introduce a conceptual scheme that singles out creative research accomplishments from other contributions in science. Furthermore, this paper shows that creative contributions are not only advances in theory but also new methods, new empirical phenomena, and the development of new research instrumentation. For illustrative purposes, the article introduces examples from science history and presents results from bibliometric studies."
"OBJECTIVE: Social media are increasingly used for the dissemination of scientific publications by most medical journals. The role of social media in increasing awareness of published works in neurosurgery has not been previously explored. Here, we present a qualitative analysis of the highest trending works in neurosurgery along with a correlation analysis with their social media metrics. METHODS: We performed a comprehensive search for neurosurgical publications using the Altmetric database. The Altmetric database provides a weighted total score of all online mentions for an article received on Facebook, Twitter, blogs, and mainstream media sources. Our search was limited to articles published within the social media era (January 2010-January 2017). Descriptive and correlational statistics were performed for all articles. The top 100 articles in altmetrics were selected for qualitative analysis. RESULTS: A total of 5794 articles were included in this study. The average Altmetric score in neurosurgical articles was 4.7 (standard deviation +/- 22.4). Journals with a social media account had significantly higher Altmetric scores for their articles compared with those without an account (P < 0.0001). The number of tweets and online mentions in news outlets had the strongest correlation values with Altmetric scores. The top 100 articles in altmetrics belonged primarily to the Journal of Neurosurgery (33%) followed by Neurosurgery (29%). CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study that details the spectrum of Altmetric scores among neurosurgical journals. Social media presence for journals is important for greater outreach and engagement. Prediction of traditional citation using altmetrics data requires a future prospective study."
"Background: The frequency with which a scientific article is cited by other studies is one way to measure its academic influence. Methods: A comprehensive search was performed to identify journal articles in the otorhinolaryngology subject category of the 2013 Journal Citation Report Science Edition over the last 30 years (1985-2014). The 100 most cited articles were reviewed and basic information including the publication year, country of origin, source journal, article type and research field was collected. Results: The 100 most cited articles were published in 15 of the 44 otorhinolaryngology journals. The number of citations per article ranged between 208 and 1559. The leading research field was otology and neurotology (n = 50), followed by rhinology (n = 23) and head and neck surgery (n = 11). Most papers originated in the USA (n = 64). Conclusion: The possibility of an article being cited is influenced by the publication language, country of origin and source journal."
"The aim of the present study is to determine the collaborative activities of Asian library and information science (LIS) researchers through bibliometric, social network analysis at the author, institution, and country levels of the LIS publications produced by Asian researchers. For the study, research articles were derived from the 1994-2013 Web of Science (WoS) archives. Coauthor analysis software was used to analyze author contributions on the New Modified Author Activity Index (NMAAI(1, 2, 3))-a measurement tool to evaluate author research activities. Results reveal (a) that LIS ""institutions collaboration pattern"" outcomes did not yield strong collaboration with Asian countries or regions, (b) intracontinent and intercontinent collaboration was less harmonious on institutional and author levels, and (c) interpretation through NMAAI(1,2,3) revealed that Asian countries did not produce sufficient collaborative LIS publications. Taiwan, South Korea, Singapore, India, Iran, Israel, and Turkey have been producing ample LIS papers, but the United States and United Kingdom emerged as leaders. This work provides a holistic view of Asian LIS development and emphasizes individual levels of collaboration, finding that most influential authors serve on coauthor networks, which differentiates this study from previous studies in the LIS field. There is immense need to develop liaisons, sign memoranda of understanding (MOUs), and participate in combined research plans and short-term research exchange programs."
"Teamwork is an increasingly important aspect of knowledge production. In particular, factors influencing team formation relative to the composition of expertise are crucial for both organizational performance and for informing policy. In this paper, I draw attention to technology access as a highly influential factor impacting expertise in team formation. I examine the hack of Microsoft Kinect as an exogenous event that suddenly reduced motion-sensing technology costs. I show that great reductions in technology costs substitute for ex ante optimal involvement of area specialists and facilitate involvement of outside-area specialists through collaboration with researchers with broader knowledge- generalists. In other words, technology costs influence the composition of expertise in teamwork, with sufficiently large reductions leading to knowledge creation that combines more broadly across knowledge areas. These findings have important implications for organizations and policy makers in crafting incentives for more diverse knowledge creation through strategic investments that lower technology costs and influence team formation."
"Background. Evaluation of the social and economic outcomes of health research funding is an area of intense interest and debate. Typically, approaches have sought to assess the impact of research funding by medical charities or regional government bodies. Independent research institutes have a similar need for accountability in investment decisions but have different objectives and funding, thus the existing approaches are not appropriate. Methods. An evaluation methodology using eight indicators was developed to assess research performance across three broad categories: knowledge creation; inputs to research; and commercial, clinical and public health outcomes. The evaluation approach was designed to provide a balanced assessment across laboratory, clinical and public health research. Results and discussion. With a diverse research agenda supported by a large number of researchers, the Research Performance Evaluation process at the Murdoch Childrens Research Institute has, by necessity, been iterative and responsive to the needs of the Institute and its staff. Since its inception 5 years ago, data collection systems have been refined, the methodology has been adjusted to capture appropriate data, staff awareness and participation has increased, and issues regarding the methodology and scoring have been resolved. Conclusions. The Research Performance Evaluation methodology described here provides a fair and transparent means of disbursing internal funding. It is also a powerful tool for evaluating the Institute's progress towards achieving its strategic goals, and is therefore a key driver for research excellence."
"The study is carried out based on 1134 journal articles on entrepreneurship education research included in CSSCI database from 1999 to 2017 as samples by employing the bibliometric and visual analysis methods, longitudinally the past, present and future of the entrepreneurship education in China, stating the concerns, focuses of the research and author collaboration at different stages of development in the academic circles, and pointing out the direction of the future study. Results show that the study on Chinese entrepreneurial education in the past 20 years has gradually come from the initial ""exploratory stage"" to the ""comprehensive advance stage"", wIten with the number of papers published is in a significant growth and the funded papers are also increasing significantly. Focuses of the entrepreneurship education research have gradually been centralized with the research perspective transformed from the preliminary theoretical research into the in-depth discussion on the real hot spot issues. The trend of partnerships between authors is also shifting from ""divergence"" to ""convergence"". For the future, It is advised to promote and improve the study on Chinese entrepreneurship education from two angles including ""active change"" and ""external intervention""."
"This paper provides a citation network analysis of the publications of the journal Higher Education from 1972 to 2014 inclusive. This represents nearly the entire history of the journal. It analyses the most published authors and the most cited articles, as well as the most cited authors. This data includes the highest number of publications both by institution and country of origin. 2176 articles were taken from Web of Science (TM) as a source of primary data. These articles were found to have 68,009 references. Analysis was carried out using the Web of Science (TM) online analytics tool and Excel(A (R)). Gephi (TM), a data visualisation and manipulation software, was then used to provide visual representations of the associated citation networks. These representations were shown to constitute ""terrains"" of citations or ""geographies of influence""-effectively bringing to bear empirical data in support of Macfarlane's higher education research ""archipelago"". Nationality biases were observed between US and UK/European/Australian higher education journals. Results indicate that the most published authors throughout the journal's history are Meyer, Kember, Richardson, Enders and Prosser. Confirming earlier studies on UK and Australian journals, the five most cited authors are Entwistle, Clark, Marton, Biggs and Ramsden. The single most cited article is Clark's 1983 Higher education system: academic organization in cross-national perspective. The top publication years for the journal were 2012, 2009 and 2011. Results from this paper shed light into the evolving concerns of the journal and its readership, and provide a demonstration of a powerful way of analysing citation data."
"This article reports on a large-scale exercise of classification of journals in the fields of Humanities and Social Sciences, carried out by the Italian Agency for the Evaluation of Universities and Research Institutes. After discussing at some length the controversies linked with journal classification and its impact, we endeavor to compare such a classification with the scores that individual articles published in the same journals were assigned by completely independent assessors in the same period of time. The data refer to an important subset of disciplines covering History, Philosophy, Geography, Anthropology, Education, and Library Sciences, allowing for comparisons between scientific fields of different sizes, outlooks, and methods. As the controversies surrounding the rating of journals focus on the difference between the container (the journal) and the content (the individual article), we addressed the following research questions: (1) Is journal rating, produced by an expert-based procedure, a good predictor of the quality of articles published in the journal? (2) To what extent different panel of experts evaluating the same journals produce consistent ratings? (3) To what extent the assessment of scientific societies on journal rating is a good predictor of the quality of articles published in journals? (4) Are there systematic biases in the peer review of articles and in the expert-based journal rating? We find that journal rating is a legitimate and robust assessment exercise, as long as it is managed carefully and in a cautious way and used to evaluate aggregates of researchers rather than individual researchers."
"As co-editors of this themed section of New Media & Society, we introduce the four articles comprising the section and briefly address facets of the changes transpiring in scholarly publishing and, more generally, scholarly communication. A plethora of issues and developments is related to this transformation and we suggest the diversity and challenges involved. We mention one development in more detail, enhanced publishing, and conclude with promising inroads for theoretical understanding and empirical investigation of how scholarly publishing and communication are evolving."
"In this paper, we investigate the effects of the introduction of 5-year impact factors. We collect impact factor data for all disciplines available in the Journal Citation Reports. For all these categories, we give insights into the relationship between the traditional 2-year impact factor and the new 5-year impact factor. Our main focus is to investigate whether the traditionally low impact factors for statistics journals improve with this new measure. The results show that the statistics discipline indeed benefits from the 5-year window, that is, the impact factor increases. This appears to be true for most disciplines, although the statistics discipline ranks among the top 15 (out of 171) disciplines in this respect."
"Regression equations to predict h index trajectories up to 10 years ahead have been recently derived from the analysis of data from a large calibration sample of neuroscientists. These equations were regarded by their proponents as potentially useful decision aids for funding agencies, peer reviewers, and hiring committees. This paper presents the results of a validation study in a sample of Spanish psychologists including neuroscience psychologists for whom the regression equations would be expected to apply but including also psychologists in other areas of the social/behavioral sciences for whom the applicability of the regression equations might be questionable. The results do not support the equations for any of the two groups: Errors of prediction were generally large and mostly positive, the more so the larger was the value of the h index used to make the prediction. Although the validity of these regression equations could still be investigated in additional cross-validation studies, an alternative approach to predicting future h indices is outlined and illustrated in this paper."
"The authors present animations based on the aggregated journal-journal citations of Leonardo during the period 1974-2008. Leonardo is mainly cited by journals outside the arts domain for cultural reasons, for example, in neuropsychology and physics. Articles in Leonardo itself cite a large number of journals, but with a focus on the arts. Animations at this level of aggregation enable us to show the history of the journal from a network perspective."
"Purpose: The osteomyelitis is an infectious inflammation of the bone marrow, which is produced by an invasion of pathogens into the osseous medullary canal. The process is significantly influenced by the co-morbidities of the patient (e.g. age, diabetes, PAD). While osteomyelitis in the pre-antibiotic era often led to amputation of the affected limb, today especially antibiotic resistance and chronic forms are a major problem. The topic osteomyelitis is therefore an object of intense research. However, a comprehensive analysis of global research activities and international networking of scientists on this issue is not yet done. Materials and Methods: This paper analyzes the entire publications on the subject of ""osteomyelitis"" from 1900-2009 in ""ISI Web of Science"" by quantitative and semi-qualitative criteria. ""Equalizing Density Map Projection"" are applied to visualize the structures of the global research and citation activity. In addition, network diagrams illustrate the bilateral and multilateral research and institutional collaborations. Results: On the basis of predetermined criteria 12632 publications can be determined. In addition to the publication numbers, the number of citations increases continuously. The analysis of country cooperation as well as the institutions indicates hegemony of the United States. Most papers about osteomyelitis are published in the subject areas of surgery, orthopedics, internal medicine and radiology. Discussion: This study is the first comprehensive, scientometric work and depicts corresponding representations of the research activities, geographical relationships and research collaborations. Conclusion: It can be seen a research focus in North America and Europe, with further intensification of cross-linking international research expenses as goal of further efforts."
"Research that integrates the social and natural sciences is vital to address many societal challenges, yet is difficult to arrange, conduct, and disseminate. This paper compares diffusion of the research supported by a unique U.S. National Science Foundation program on Human and Social Dynamics (""HSD"") with a matched group of heavily cited papers. We offer a measure of the distance of cites between the Web of Science Category (""WoSC"") in which a publication appears and the WoSC of the journal citing it, and find that HSD publications are cited more distantly than are comparison publications. We provide another measure-citation velocity-finding that HSD publications are cited with similar lag times as are the comparison papers. These basic citation distance and velocity measures enrich analyses of research knowledge diffusion patterns."
"How do the effects of cognitive openness and structural openness on the research impact of business scholars vary over their careers? By analysing a longitudinal sample of 35,296 scholars who published in business and management journals, we show that the cognitive openness and the structural openness of business scholars have non-linear relationships with their research impact. In particular, we found that, whereas moderate levels of cognitive openness and structural openness are desirable for increasing young scholars' citations, a high level of cognitive openness and a low level of structural openness contribute to senior scholars' citations. This study contributes to our understanding of different search behaviour across business scholars' career paths and its implications for scholars' research impact."
"This article is focused on the government program for increasing competitiveness of Russian universities ""5-top 100"" started in 2013. The main aim of the program is creating necessary conditions for Russian universities for being ranked in the top-quality world rankings. Fifteen universities were carefully selected among many other institutions. The university funding amount for the next year directly depends on the current year results. We analyzed the results of universities participating and not participating in the program ""5-top 100"" for the years 2008-2014 within the university groups and with reference group as well as with world and country average values. Based on the analysis we can state that the program ""5-top 100"" enables not only participating universities to improve their current result. The program helps universities in prioritizing their aims and enhancing their competitiveness at the world level that is supported by positions in world university rankings."
"This paper presents some selected issues currently discussed about the integrity of science, and it argues that there exist serious challenges to integrity in the various sciences. Due to the involved conceptual complexities, even core definitions of scientific integrity have been disputed, and core cases of scientific misconduct influenced the public discussion about them. It is claimed that ethics and law may not always go well together in matters of scientific integrity. Explanations of the causes of scientific misconduct vary, and defining good scientific practices is not a straightforward task. Even though the efficacy of ethics courses to improve scientific integrity can be doubted, and universities probably need to come up with more innovative formats to improve ethics in scientific training, ethics talk may be the only practical remedy.

"This paper describes a journal evaluation method by the California Digital Library (CDL). The method includes the parameters usability, quality and cost efficiency of the analysed titles in relation to each other. In the following, this article presents a report about an application of the method to the e-journals of the departmental libraries of biology (118 titles) and chemistry (88 titles) of the Wurzburg University Library for the year 2012. Selected results are discussed in more detail. They are compared with the results of an evaluation based on cost per use."
"The responsible conduct of research (RCR) Center is an innovative, workshop-based approach to research ethics education at the University of Pittsburgh. A flexibly scheduled program of workshops combines the benefits of traditional case-based discussion and in-person instruction with greater accessibility and a broader disciplinary reach. Essential features of the program include a rotating schedule of independent workshops with separate registration, expert speakers, and a dedicated program director position. At an institutional level, this novel response to National Institutes of Health-mandated training requirements increases access to a wide range of interactive RCR training programs and promotes interdisciplinary conversations on research ethics that involves investigators, trainees, and the research community at large."
The Chinese academic assessment and incentive system drew mixed responses from academia. In the essay the author tried to explain why the current assessment system is appropriate in China and an opportunistic behavior in Chinese academia is exposed.
"The purpose of this study was to examine research and trends in knowledge management in education (KME) published in selected professional sources during the period 1990-2008. Citation analysis was used in this study to investigate documents related to KME, which were indexed in the Web of Science, Education Researches Information Center and ScienceDirect. Knowledge management- and educational technology-related keywords were used jointly in the search for documents. There were a total of 125 documents judged to be relevant to the field of KME and were analysed. As a result of this study, it can be seen that the documents and the number of citations related to the KME field has been continuously increasing since 2005. It is recommended that a combination of citation analysis and other types of analyses should be used in future research studies."
"Geographical proximity, population, language and other cultural factors are given as reasons for international collaboration on scientific studies. These reasons are also used to analyze international trade in goods. The scientists exchange ideas in joint papers so international collaboration on scientific studies can be labeled as international trade in ideas. In this paper, we take on this perspective and establish a link between international trade in goods and ideas. First, we define export and import of ideas by using the co-authorship patterns. Second, we compute metrics such as net exports for the international trade in ideas. Third, we compare and contrast goods and ideas by using these metrics. Lastly, we use the international trade models such as the Hecksher-Ohlin model to analyze the factors that affect international trade in ideas. We find that the correlation is weak and even negative between international trade metrics for goods and ideas in general, but the correlation between some specific goods and ideas is positive and stronger. By using the Hecksher-Ohlin model, we explore reasons for comparative advantage in exporting ideas."
"A bibliometric analysis was performed to evaluate the global scientific production on ecological restoration from the period of 1997 to 2017. This analysis was based on online database of Science Citation Index Expanded Web of Science and a total of 3297 publications was retrieved. The analysis comprised seven main aspects: (1) publication activity, (2) Web of Science categories, (3) journals, (4) countries, (5) authors, (6) organizations and (7) keywords. The results indicated that the annual publications on ecological restoration study have recently increased. The USA play an important role as they have published highly in this field and have been the most frequent partner in international collaborations. American researchers have accumulated most of the publications. The Chinese Academy of Science is the emblematic organization, with 363 published papers. The Restoration Ecology and Ecological Engineering are the two most used journals to disseminate results. The major related research areas are ""Environmental Science Ecology"", ""Forestry"" and ""Biodiversity Conservation"". Studies about ""restoration"", ""pinus ponderosa"", ""climate change"", ""biodiversity"" and ""ecosystem services"" have become the main subject of research along the years. Analyses of keywords suggested that there is a relatively lack of information about ""soil"" and ""tropical ecosystems"" among the analyzed studies. Overall, this framework proved to be effective to evaluate the recent research trends and to contribute with researchers and governments on management and decision-making on science."
"The citer h-index of a researcher (introduced by Ajiferuke and Wolfram) was found to have a strong linear relationship with the h-index of this researcher. This finding of Franceschini, Maisano, Perotti and Proto also revealed, experimentally, that the slope of this straight line (passing through the origin) is strictly larger than one. In this paper we present a rationale for this empirical result of this author on the relation between the h-index before and after a transformation of the citation data."
"Background: The aim of this study was to survey the Iranian Parasitology researchers. performance, and analyse and visualize the scientific outputs of their co-authorship network. Methods: This study was conducted using scientometric method and social network analysis (SNA). The data extracted from the Web of Science (WoS) databases in July 10th 2014. Totally, 1048documents of all types in research area of Parasitology during 1972-2013 by Iranian researches retrieved. The co-authorship map was drawn utilizing NETDRAW, Coauthor. exe, and UCINET softwares and was analysed based on SNA measures. Results: The researchers. co-authorship network consisted of 78 authors and its density degree is 0.57. ""Mohebali"" ranked top in all of centrality measures. The most of the publications were related to 2012, ""Mohebali"" with about 9% of all documents was the Iranian most prolific author in Parasitology field. The Iranian researches have published mostly (266 documents) in ""Iranian Journal of Parasitology"", and the most of the documents belong to ""Tropical Medicine"" subject field. The most of Iranian researchers. scientific cooperation was performed with England and United States. Conclusion: Bringing forth density degree (is 0.57) showed that this network has an almost medium density. Indeed, the authors have had relations in moderate level with each other in the network. The findings of this study can be identified aspects of scientific collaboration, and help policy makers of Parasitology field research."
"This paper proposes an extension to CERIF compatible CRIS, enabling automated evaluation of research achievements by applying diverse (country/region/institution specific), or even multiple evaluation rulebooks and guidelines. It was implemented as an extension to the CERIF compliant CRIS system of the University of Novi Sad (CRIS UNS) that already contains information for assessment of results from scientific journals, so the focus of this research is an extension to the CERIF model aimed at evaluation of the results published through conferences. Based on a survey and an analysis of selected evaluation rulebooks and guidelines, the paper proposes an extended CERIF model that comprises conference evaluation related metadata and a machine-readable representation of a rulebook that enables automated evaluation. A rule-based expert system is proposed for representation of evaluation rules and evaluation of research results. The Serbian rulebook is represented and implemented using the expert system Jess in order to evaluate the proposed model. Reliance of the model on CERIF standard allows its easy application in any CERIF compatible CRIS system."
"Citation-based indicators are often used to help evaluate the impact of published medical studies, even though the research has the ultimate goal of improving human wellbeing. One direct way of influencing health outcomes is by guiding physicians and other medical professionals about which drugs to prescribe. A high profile source of this guidance is the AHFS DI Essentials product of the American Society of Health-System Pharmacists, which gives systematic information for drug prescribers. AHFS DI Essentials documents, which are also indexed by Drugs.com, include references to academic studies and the referenced work is therefore helping patients by guiding drug prescribing. This article extracts AHFS DI Essentials documents from Drugs.com and assesses whether articles referenced in these information sheets have their value recognised by higher Scopus citation counts. A comparison of mean log-transformed citation counts between articles that are and are not referenced in AHFS DI Essentials shows that AHFS DI Essentials references are more highly cited than average for the publishing journal. This suggests that medical research influencing drug prescribing is more cited than average."
"The scholarly information system is not a conventional market. It does follow a particular economic structure, but that structure does not follow orthodox macroeconomics. The multiple players who make up the system do compete and, at times, do cooperate, but not on the grounds of the economic theory of textbooks. An analysis that takes the differences into account is the only way to create an understanding of the system. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved."
"This paper characterizes the body of knowledge on biomass energy from 1998 to 2013 by employing bibliometric techniques based on the Science Citation Index (SCI) databases of the Web of Science. Results showed that journal articles were the most frequently used document type representing 84.1% of the records. 33,072 articles were analyzed on various aspects of the publication characteristics such as authorship, countries, institutions, high-cited papers, and keywords. The pace of publishing in this field increased rapidly over last 16 years, with the US accounting for the highest h-index (137) and the most publications (8228), followed by China and India. The US also plays a central role in the collaboration network among the most productive countries. The Chinese Academy of Science was the organization with the most records (639). Similarly, the University of Illinois is central to the collaboration network. The hot spots of biomass energy related researches were transiting from physical conversion (6511 articles) to thermal chemical conversion (10,989) and biochemical (10,877).The bioenergy application (18,607) has become a main focus of current researches related to biomass energy. This topic mainly addresses biodiesel, biogas, biohydrogen, biofuel cell and so on. By identifying global hotspots in biomass energy research, this study is beneficial for researchers, e.g. the selection of future research topics. Similarly, policy makers will learn from the findings of this analysis with a good understanding of the status quo of biomass energy development. (c) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."
"We conducted a fine-grained prosopography of six distinguished information scientists to explore commonalities and differences in their approaches to scholarly production at different stages of their careers. Specifically, we gathered data on authors' genre preferences, rates and modes of scholarly production, and coauthorship patterns. We also explored the role played by gender and place in determining mentoring and collaboration practices across time. Our biobibliometric profiles of the sextet reveal the different shapes a scholar's career can take. We consider the implications of our findings for new entrants into the academic marketplace."
"An analysis of the number of research papers from India and China in the fields of sciences and engineering between the years 1975 and 2012 is presented. The results show that while Indian research output has increased steadily, the Chinese research output has been increasing at a rate far outpacing that of India. The research output of China has been increasing with distinct inflection points that show an acceleration in output growth. The research output for India shows periodic inflection points that show either an acceleration or deceleration in output growth. The possible reasons for the inflection points are discussed. Simple statistical analyses are used to analyze the trends in output. Although multiple factors affect a nation's research output, this paper highlights that the government programs targeted to increase the research output from universities may create inflection points resulting in a rapid increase in the research output. The article also highlights that India has fallen far behind China in terms of scientific and engineering research output, providing important clues for the future growth of the two countries."
"We present an empirical comparison between two normalization mechanisms for citation-based indicators of research performance. These mechanisms aim to normalize citation counts for the field and the year in which a publication was published. One mechanism is applied in the current so-called crown indicator of our institute. The other mechanism is applied in the new crown indicator that our institute is currently exploring. We find that at high aggregation levels, such as at the level of large research institutions or at the level of countries, the differences between the two mechanisms are very small. At lower aggregation levels, such as at the level of research groups or at the level of journals, the differences between the two mechanisms are somewhat larger. We pay special attention to the way in which recent publications are handled. These publications typically have very low citation counts and should therefore be handled with special care."
"We measure the knowledge flows between countries by analysing publication and citation data, arguing that not all citations are equally important. Therefore, in contrast to existing techniques that utilize absolute citation counts to quantify knowledge flows between different entities, our model employs a citation context analysis technique, using a machine-learning approach to distinguish between important and non-important citations. We use 14 novel features (including context-based, cue words-based and text-based) to train a Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Random Forest classifier on an annotated dataset of 20,527 publications downloaded from the Association for Computational Linguistics anthology (http://allenai.org/data.html). Our machine-learning models outperform existing state-of-the-art citation context approaches, with the SVM model reaching up to 61% and the Random Forest model up to a very encouraging 90% Precision-Recall Area Under the Curve, with 10-fold cross-validation. Finally, we present a case study to explain our deployed method for datasets of PLoS ONE full-text publications in the field of Computer and Information Sciences. Our results show that a significant volume of knowledge flows from the United States, based on important citations, are consumed by the international scientific community. Of the total knowledge flow from China, we find a relatively smaller proportion (only 4.11%) falling into the category of knowledge flow based on important citations, while The Netherlands and Germany show the highest proportions of knowledge flows based on important citations, at 9.06 and 7.35% respectively. Among the institutions, interestingly, the findings show that at the University of Malaya more than 10% of the knowledge produced falls into the category of important. We believe that such analyses are helpful to understand the dynamics of the relevant knowledge flows across nations and institutions."
"Increased specialization and extensive collaboration are common behaviours in the scientific community, as well as the evaluation of scientific research based on bibliometric indicators. This paper aims to analyse the effect of collaboration (co-authorship) on the scientific output of Italian economists. We use social network analysis to investigate the structure of co-authorship, and econometric analysis to explain the productivity of individual Italian economists, in terms of 'attributional' variables (such as age, gender, academic position, tenure, scientific sub-discipline, geographical location), 'relational' variables (such as propensity to cooperate and the stability of cooperation patterns) and 'positional' variables (such as betweenness and closeness centrality indexes and clustering coefficients)."
"This paper presents results of a qualitative survey and a quantitative assessment of the relative impacts of transportation journals. The survey involved 80 research university professors, government employees, and practitioners randomly chosen to rate a list of peer-reviewed transportation journals. The quantitative assessment consisted of an extensive examination of the impact factor (IF), a widely used metric for comparing scholarly publications, of 30 major transportation journals. Although the Transportation Research Record (TRR) was ranked by far as the most ""useful and important"" to the work of all those surveyed in the field of transportation, the TRR's IF is lower than those of most other transportation journals. However, compared with other transportation journals, the TRR publishes the most scholarly papers and receives the most citations annually. It is also the most widely accessed by practitioners. This paper explores key factors that affect IF calculations and identifies strategies to enhance the TRR's IF with nominal and major changes to the current process and procedures. These strategies focus on increasing exposure time of papers published in the TRR and increasing timely access to TRR issues, as well as exploring the potential to subdivide the TRR into several thematic sections, which would lead to substantial increases in the IFs of several of the parts."
"Social media has become mainstream in recent years, and its adoption has skyrocketed. Following this trend among the general public, scholars are also increasingly adopting these tools for their professional work. The current study seeks to learn if, why and how scholars are using social media for communication and information dissemination, as well as validate and update the results of previous scholarship in this area. The study is based on the content analysis of 51 semi-structured interviews of scholars in the Information Science and Technology field. Unlike previous studies, the current work aims not only to highlight the specific social media tools used, but also discover factors that influence intention and use of social media by scholars. To achieve this, the paper uses the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT), a widely adopted technology acceptance theory. This paper contributes new knowledge to methodological discussions as it is the first known study to employ UTAUT to interpret scholarly use of social media. It also offers recommendations about how UTAUT can be expanded to better fit examinations of social media use within scholarly practices. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."
"Author name ambiguity degrades information retrieval, database integration, search results and, more importantly, correct attributions in bibliographic databases. Some unresolved issues include how to ascertain the actual number of authors, how to improve the performance and how to make the method more effective in terms of representative clustering metrics (average cluster purity, average author purity, K-metric, pairwise precision, pairwise recall, pairwise-F1, cluster precision, cluster recall and cluster-F1). It is a non-trivial task to disambiguate authors using only the implicit bibliographic information. An effective method 'DISC' is proposed that uses graph community detection algorithm, feature vectors and graph operations to disambiguate homonyms. The citation data set is pre-processed and ambiguous author blocks are formed. A co-authors graph is constructed using authors and their co-author's relationships. A graph structural clustering 'gSkeletonClu' is applied to identify hubs, outliers and clusters of nodes in a co-author's graph. Homonyms are resolved by splitting these clusters of nodes across the hub if their feature vector similarity is less than a predefined threshold. DISC utilises only co-authors and titles that are available in almost all bibliographic databases. With little modifications, DISC can also be used for entity disambiguation. To validate the DISC performance, experiments are performed on two Arnetminer data sets and compared with five previous unsupervised methods. Despite using limited bibliographic metadata, DISC achieves on average K-metric, pairwise-F1, and cluster-F1 of 92%, 84% and 74%, respectively, using Arnetminer-S and 86%, 80% and 57%, respectively, using Arnetminer-L. About 77.5% and 73.2% clusters are within the range (ground truth clusters +/- 3) in Arnetminer-S and Arnetminer-L, respectively."
"The ability to activate and manage effective collaborations is becoming an increasingly important criteria in policies on academic career advancement. The rise of such policies leads to development of indicators that permit measurement of the propensity to collaborate for academics of different ranks, and to examine the role of several variables in collaboration, first among these being the researchers' disciplines. In this work we apply an innovative bibliometric approach based on individual propensity for collaboration to measure the differences in propensity across academic ranks, by discipline and for choice of collaboration forms-intramural, extramural domestic and international. The analysis is based on the scientific production of Italian academics for the period 2006-2010, totaling over 200,000 publications indexed in Web of Science. It shows that assistant professors register a propensity for intramural collaboration that is clearly greater than for professors of higher ranks. Vice versa, the higher ranks, but not quite so clearly, register greater propensity to collaborate at the international level."
"A bibliometric analysis of the 50 most frequently publishing Spanish universities shows large differences in the publication activity and citation impact among research disciplines within an institution. Gini Index is a useful measure of an institution's disciplinary specialization and can roughly categorize universities in terms of general versus specialized. A study of the Spanish academic system reveals that assessment of a university's research performance must take into account the disciplinary breadth of its publication activity and citation impact. It proposes the use of graphs showing not only a university's article production and citation impact, but also its disciplinary specialization. Such graphs constitute both a warning and a remedy against one-dimensional approaches to the assessment of institutional research performance."
"Study objective: We define a minimally important difference for the Likert-type scores frequently used in scientific peer review (similar to existing minimally important differences for scores in clinical medicine). The magnitude of score change required to change editorial decisions has not been studied, to our knowledge. Methods: Experienced editors at a journal in the top 6% by impact factor were asked how large a change of rating in ""overall desirability for publication"" was required to trigger a change in their initial decision on an article. Minimally important differences were assessed twice for each editor: once assessing the rating change required to shift the editor away from an initial decision to accept, and the other assessing the magnitude required to shift away from an initial rejection decision. Results: Forty-one editors completed the survey (89% response rate). In the acceptance frame, the median minimally important difference was 0.4 points on a scale of 1 to 5. Editors required a greater rating change to shift from an initial rejection decision; in the rejection frame, the median minimally important difference was 1.2 points. Within each frame, there was considerable heterogeneity: in the acceptance frame, 38% of editors did not change their decision within the maximum available range; in the rejection frame, 51% did not. Conclusion: To our knowledge, this is the first study to determine the minimally important difference for Likert-type ratings of research article quality, or in fact any nonclinical scientific assessment variable. Our findings may be useful for future research assessing whether changes to the peer review process produce clinically meaningful differences in editorial decisionmaking."
"We discuss the elements that support systematic literature mapping and the nature and context of systematic literature mapping, emphasizing the specific meaning of the adjective ""systematic"" as one that corresponds to the adoption of procedures that seek to eliminate biases (i) in the location of references; (ii) selection of significant references; (iii) content of selected references; (iv) extraction of information and understanding from references; and (v) the critical appreciation of the content of references. We also argue that graduate students are responsible for their own systematic mapping and that systematic mapping depends on the attention paid to the panoramic, initial contact with a given field. We detail the five stages of systematic mapping process: (1) searching for references; (2) compiling references and organizing them into a system; (3) filtering/selecting references; (4) reporting the results; (5) controlling the process, presenting each stage in general terms before detailing more pragmatic aspects. Our final remarks address some of the consequences of producing systematic mapping for the practice of scientific research in Brazil."
"Scientific production has been evaluated from very different perspectives, the best known of which are essentially based on the impact factors of the journals included in the Journal Citation Reports (JCR). This has been no impediment to the simultaneous issuing of warnings regarding the dangers of their indiscriminate use when making comparisons. This is because the biases incorporated in the elaboration of these impact factors produce significant distortions, which may invalidate the results obtained. Notable among such biases are those generated by the differences in the propensity to cite of the different areas, journals and/or authors, by variations in the period of materialisation of the impact and by the varying presence of knowledge areas in the sample of reviews contained in the JCR. While the traditional evaluation method consists of standardisation by subject categories, recent studies have criticised this approach and offered new possibilities for making inter-area comparisons. In view of such developments, the present study proposes a novel approach to the measurement of scientific activity, in an attempt to lessen the aforementioned biases. This approach consists of combining the employment of a new impact factor, calculated for each journal, with the grouping of the institutions under evaluation into homogeneous groups. An empirical application is undertaken to evaluate the scientific production of Spanish public universities in the year 2000. This application considers both the articles published in the multidisciplinary databases of the Web of Science (WoS) and the data concerning the journals contained in the Sciences and Social Sciences Editions of the Journal Citation Report (JCR). All this information is provided by the Institute of Scientific Information (ISI), via its Web of Knowledge (WoK)."
"In 2014 over 52,000 academics submitted > 155,500 journal articles in 36 different disciplines for assessment in the UK's four-year Research Evaluation Framework (the REF). In this paper the characteristics of the titles of these papers are assessed. Although these varied considerably between the disciplines, the main findings were that: (i) the lengths of the titles increased with the number of authors in almost all disciplines, (ii) the use of colons and question marks tended to decline with increasing author numbers-although there were a few disciplines, such as economics, where the reverse was evident, (iii) papers published later on in the 4-year period tended to have more authors than those published earlier, and (iv), in some disciplines, the numbers of subsequent citations to papers were higher when the titles were shorter and when they employed colons but lower when they used question marks."
"Today's peer-review process for scientific articles is unnecessarily opaque and offers few incentives to referees. Likewise, the publishing process is unnecessarily inefficient, and its results are only rarely made freely available to the public. This article outlines a comparatively simple extension of arXiv.org, an online preprint archive widely used in the mathematical and physical sciences, that addresses both of these problems. Under the proposal, editors invite referees to write public and signed reviews to be attached to the posted preprints, and then elevate selected articles to 'published' status."
"China has a long and proud history of world leadership in science and technology, but in the past two centuries it has experienced a period of instability that has challenged that leadership. However, since its political consolidation in the middle part of the 20th Century and its subsequent economic reforms, China's rise in science has been meteoric. This rise was first detected by the scientometric community through its indicators, but it has now become obvious. Indeed in 2017 the question, ""Will China come to lead world science?"" was becoming to some, ""Does China already lead world science?"" This paper tries to make the case that the answer is ""yes"" (or at least ""soon"")-but the answer depends on which metrics one considers. China already leads many countries in some measures of GDP, scientific paper production, researchers, plus high technology manufacturing and exports. China also recently passed the European Union in R&D investment. Even in some of those indicators where China has not yet taken the lead, reasonable forecasts predict that it soon will. However, there are some indicators where China is still far behind. For example while rising, it still lags the U.S. and EU in citations in Western publications, and will take years to catch up. Here, these quantitative measures are supplemented by qualitative ones from WTEC assessments and by survey results of scientists and the public, which present a more nuanced conclusion. While Chinese leadership may be difficult for Westerners to accept, it can be viewed as China merely regaining its historical position of leadership in science and technology."
"This study investigated name changes of women authors to determine how they were represented in indexes and cited references and identify problem areas. A secondary purpose of the study was to investigate whether or not indexing services were using authority control and how this influenced the search results. The works of eight library science authors who had published under multiple names were examined. The researchers compared author names as they appeared on title pages of publications versus in four online databases and in bibliographies by checking 380 publications and 1,159 citations. Author names were correctly provided 81.22% of the time in indexing services and 90.94% in citation lists. The lowest accuracy (54.55%) occurred when limiting to publications found in Library Literature. The highest accuracy (94.18%) occurred with works published before a surname changed. Author names in indexes and citations correctly matched names on journal articles more often than for any other type of publication. Indexes and citation style manuals treated author names in multiple ways, often altering names substantially from how they appear on the title page. Recommendations are made for changes in editorial styles by indexing services and by the authors themselves to help alleviate future confusion in author name searching."
"Inaccurate data in scientific papers can result from honest error or intentional falsification. This study attempted to determine the percentage of published papers that contain inappropriate image duplication, a specific type of inaccurate data. The images from a total of 20,621 papers published in 40 scientific journals from 1995 to 2014 were visually screened. Overall, 3.8% of published papers contained problematic figures, with at least half exhibiting features suggestive of deliberate manipulation. The prevalence of papers with problematic images has risen markedly during the past decade. Additional papers written by authors of papers with problematic images had an increased likelihood of containing problematic images as well. As this analysis focused only on one type of data, it is likely that the actual prevalence of inaccurate data in the published literature is higher. The marked variation in the frequency of problematic images among journals suggests that journal practices, such as prepublication image screening, influence the quality of the scientific literature."
"While the citation context of a reference may provide detailed and direct information about the nature of a citation, few studies have specifically addressed the role of this information in retrieving relevant documents from the literature primarily due to the lack of full text databases. In this paper, we design a retrieval system based on full texts in the PubMed Central database. We constructed two modules in the retrieval system. One is a reference retrieval module based on citation contexts. Another is a citation context retrieval module for searching the citation contexts of a specific paper. The results of comparisons show that the reference retrieval module performed better than Google Scholar and PubMed database in terms of finding proper references based on topic words extracted from citation context. It also performed very well on searching highly cited papers and classic papers. The citation context retrieval module visualizes the topics of citation contexts as tag clouds and classifies citation contexts based on cue words in citation contexts."
"Background: In the general surgical and anaesthetic literature, there has been a decline in research output originating from the UK. This study analysed the 10 globally leading and 2 UK leading otorhinolaryngology journals to determine whether this trend was also reflected within otorhinolaryngology. Methods: Citable research output was analysed from 4 individual years, over a 10-year period (2000-2010), to determine absolute output, geographical mix and article type. Results: The proportion of research output from the UK and Ireland grew 22.8 per cent among the leading global otorhinolaryngology journals, but fell 28.6 per cent among the leading two UK otorhinolaryngology journals. The converse trend was true for the USA and Canada. Output from European and the rest of the world grew among both sets of journals, while Japanese output fell. 'Research' articles remained the most prevalent type. Conclusion: These results are encouraging as they refute the fall in UK research output observed by other authors. In the face of growing challenges, it is important to maintain published output so that the fate that has befallen other specialties is not mirrored within UK otorhinolaryngology."
"In recent years, the UPF has implemented several initiatives to disseminate the scientific output of the university's teaching and research personnel: UPF digital repository (e-Repositori), scientific output portal (PPC), and the provision of tools and recommendations to standardize an author's name and affiliation, evaluate scholarly journals, improve the curriculum vitae, etc. The library's role in these initiatives is discussed, along with the increasing importance of these activities within the scope of academic libraries."
"Hutchins, Yuan, Anderson, and Santangelo (2015) proposed the Relative Citation Ratio (RCR) as a new field-normalized impact indicator. This study investigates the RCR by correlating it on the level of single publications with established field-normalized indicators and assessments of the publications by peers. We find that the RCR correlates highly with established field-normalized indicators, but the correlation between RCR and peer assessments is only low to medium."
"The increased presence and widespread use of specialized databases, as well as the possibilities for distribution offered by new technologies, require a pertinent method for analyzing documents. Indexing languages emerge from the information growth generated by the scientific revolution as a quick, standardized way to process, store and retrieve document contents. This paper examines the characteristics and advantages of documentary languages in the digital age, describing examples of thesauri and their corresponding hierarchical relationships as applied to eating disorders."
"Building a world-class scientific community requires first-class ingredients at many different levels: funding, training, management, international collaborations, creativity, ethics, and an understanding of research integrity practices. All over the world, addressing these practices has been high on the science policy agenda of major research systems. Universities have a central role in fostering a culture of research integrity, which has posed additional challenges for faculty, students and administrators - but also opportunities. In Brazil, the leading universities and governmental funding agencies are collaborating on this project, but much remains to be done."
"We analyse topics and authorship networks in articles on agricultural transition that were published in 16 subject-related peer-review journals between 1989 and 2008. Increasingly, articles on transition are written by authors from the European Union-15 in collaboration with authors from Central and Eastern Europe countries. The importance of authors from North America has fallen since the mid-1990s, and authors from Former Soviet Union countries have not made a large contribution to the literature. A group of roughly 10 authors plays a central role in the literature on agricultural transition, which has become increasingly method-driven and less descriptive or issue-driven over time. The co-authorship network for transition articles is characterised by a predominance of individuals or small groups of authors who have published only one or two papers."
"Paul Hagenmuller (1921-2017) is an important figure of French solid-state chemistry, who enjoyed scientific and institutional recognition. He published 796 papers and has been cited more than 16,000 times. This paper explores Hagenmuller's work using scientometric analysis to reveal the impact of his work, his main research topics and his collaborations. Although Hagenmuller was a recognized scientist, a subset of his work, now highly cited, attracted little attention at the time of publication. To understand this phenomenon, we detect and study papers with delayed recognition, also called 'Sleeping Beauties' (SBs). In scientometrics, SBs are publications that go unnoticed, or 'sleep' for a long time before suddenly attracting a lot of attention in terms of citations. We identify 7 SBs published between 1965 and 1985, and awakened between 1993 and 2010. The first SB reports the discovery of the clathrate structure of silicon. The second reports the isolation of four new phases with the formula NaxCoO2 (x < =1). The five other SBs investigate the electrochemical intercalation and deintercalation of sodium, and the structure and properties of layered oxides. Through interviews with his coworkers, we attempt to identify the reasons for the delayed recognition and the context of the renewed interest in those papers."
"We study global and local Q-measures, as well as betweenness centrality, as indicators of international collaboration in research. After a brief review of their definitions, we introduce the concepts of external and internal inter-group geodesics. These concepts are applied to a collaboration network of 1129 researchers from different countries, which is based on publications in bibliometrics, informetrics, webometrics, and scientometrics (BIWS in short) from the period 1990-2009. It is thus illustrated how international collaboration (among authors from different countries) in BIWS is carried out. Our results suggest that average scores for local Q-measures are typically higher, indicating a relatively low degree of international collaboration in BIWS. The dominating form of international collaboration is bilateral, whereas multilateral collaboration is relatively rare in the field of BIWS. We also identify and visualize the most important global and local actors. Dividing the entire period in four 5-year periods, it is found that most international collaboration in the field has happened in the last time slice (2005-2009). A comparison of the different time slices reveals the non-linear growth of the indicators studied and the international expansion of the field."
"In today's world when biomedical science is experiencing continuous threats from various sources, publication of research articles in predatory journals has created a major havoc. These predatory journals are publishing worthless biomedical science which will haunt genuine researchers and keen readers of authentic biomedical journals for several decades. Hence, researchers of various disciplines and academic experience should be continuously made aware of these predatory publishers and potential ways to recognize them. The main aim of this article is to discuss the issues related to predatory publishing, techniques and strategies used by these publishers to prey young inexperienced researchers, and disadvantages of publishing in predatory journals."
"Object. The h index is a recently developed bibliometric that assesses an investigator's scientific impact with a single number. It has rapidly gained popularity in the physical and, more recently, medical sciences. Methods. The h index for all 1120 academic neurosurgeons working at all Electronic Residency Application Service listed training programs was determined by reference to Google Scholar. A random subset of 100 individuals was investigated in PubMed to determine the total number of publications produced. Results. The median h index was 9 (range 0-68), with the 75th, 90th, and 95th percentiles being 17, 26, and 36, respectively. The h indices increased significantly with increasing academic rank, with the median for instructors, assistant professors, associate professors, and professors being 2, 5, 10, and 19, respectively (p < 0.0001, Kruskal-Wallis; all groups significantly different from each other except the difference between instructor and assistant professor [Conover]). Departmental chairs had a median h index of 22 (range 3-55) and program directors a median of 17 (range 0-62). Plot of the log of the rank versus h index demonstrated a remarkable linear pattern (R-2 = 0.995, p < 0.0001), suggesting that this is a power-law relationship. Conclusions. A survey of the h index for all of academic neurosurgery is presented. Results can be used for benchmark purposes. The distribution of the h index within an academic population is described for the first time and appears related to the ubiquitous power-law distribution. (DOI: 10.3171/2010.4.JNS091842)"
"This study examines differences in perceptions of journal quality and editorial support among three categories of Chinese authors: those whose manuscripts were accepted without revision, those whose manuscripts were accepted after revision, and those whose manuscripts were rejected. An analysis of online reviews of journal quality and editorial support in six disciplines revealed the existence of biases caused by authors' submission experiences. The results show that a Chinese author will rate the quality of a journal and its editorial support higher if his or her manuscript was accepted by the journal regardless of whether he or she was required to make revisions. The results also indicate that no major variations exist in perceptions of journal quality and editorial support between authors whose manuscripts were accepted without revision and authors whose manuscripts were accepted after revision."
"Use of information and communication technologies (ICTs) to support research work is becoming increasingly common. This study set out to establish how ICTs are being used to support collaborative research in Kenya, and identify factors within the ICT ecosystem that contribute to their adoption and use. A mixed methods research design, involving 248 academic scientists in 4 disciplines across 4 major Kenyan universities, was employed. We find little diversity in forms of ICTs used to support collaborative research within the studied population. Several factors affect adoption and use practices, including availability and access to ICT resources, nature of the work, national and institutional ICT and research environments and the social cultural practices of researchers. We explain our findings using Venkatesh et al.'s Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology model, which identifies four main constructs that affect adoption of technology such as performance expectancy, effort expectancy, facilitating conditions and social influence."
"Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to provide a comprehensive understanding of scholarly discussions of academic publications on the social web and to further discuss the validity of altmetrics as a research impact assessment tool for academic articles. Design/methodology/approach - Facebook posts citing psychological journal papers were collected for both quantitative and qualitative analyses. A content analysis approach was adopted to investigate topic preferences and motivations for scholarly discussions among academic and non-academic Facebook users. Findings - Non-academic users were more actively engaged in scholarly discussions on Facebook than academic users. Among 1,711 Facebook users in the sample, 71.4 percent of them belonged to non-academic users, while 28.6 percent were from an academic background. The Facebook users cited psychological articles with various motivations: discussion and evaluation toward articles (20.4 percent), application to real life practices (16.5 percent), self-promotion (6.4 percent), and data source exchange (6.0 percent). However, nearly half of the posts (50.1 percent) were simply sharing articles without additional user comments. These results implicate that Facebook metric (a count of mentions of a research article on Facebook), as an important source of altmetrics, better reflects the attitudes or perceptions of the general public instead of academia. Originality/value - This study contributes to the literature by enriching the understanding of Facebook metric as an academic and non-academic impact assessment tool for scientific publication. Through the content analysis of Facebook posts, it also draws insights into the ways in which non-academic audiences are engaging with scholarly outputs."
"In national research assessment exercises that take the peer review approach, research organizations are evaluated on the basis of a subset of their scientific production. The dimension of the subset varies from nation to nation but is typically set as a proportional function of the number of researchers employed at each research organization. However, scientific fertility varies from discipline to discipline, meaning that the representativeness of such a subset also varies according to discipline. The rankings resulting from the assessments could be quite sensitive to the size of the share of articles selected for evaluation. The current work examines this issue, developing empirical evidence of variations in ranking due changes in the dimension of the subset of products evaluated. The field of observation is represented by the scientific production from the hard sciences of the entire Italian university system, from 2001 to 2003."
"Citation metrics and its related indices and rankings have become increasingly important in the evaluation of research. Such indices are part of a more general tendency aiming for the simplification of complex and interconnected phenomena through quantification. The purpose of our contribution is to analyze the impact of such quantitative indices on the further development of science, with a special emphasis on economics. In this case, we observe a multitude of interesting effects on both the level of individual scientists and the global development of the discipline."
"Latin American regional journals have adopted measures to increase both their quality and visibility, among which figures the promotion of their inclusion in international databases such as Scopus and Web of Science. An increasing number have recently taken advantage of the support and hosting services offered by Elsevier on the Science Direct (SD) platform, with the expectation of achieving this goal. The present study takes a preliminary look at the tendencies in the coverage in these databases of a sample of open access Latin American journals hosted on SD in June 2016 and their metadata, to typify the most common errors which can affect the use of performance indicators in individual and institutional evaluations and the integration of authors into scholarly reputation systems. A significant level of these errors was found relating to such aspects as journal coverage, duplicate records, reference data and links to full text, in addition to conventions concerning author names and titles that adversely affect retrieval of articles and the correct assignation of author credit and of citations, suggesting that present strategies have yet to deliver the expected results."
"Universities' R&D and innovation activity takes place within the economic and social context of a specific territory. This activity is multidimensional and its different dimensions may be unduly influenced by the economic context in which it is carried out. The present work analyses the research activity of Spanish public universities in the context of per capita GDP of their territories. The work examines data from 2002-2010 obtained from the IUNE observatory. The relationship between GDP and the different dimensions of research activity are analyzed: recognition, scientific activity, innovation, competitiveness and research training capacity. The results show that the economic context in which the activity takes place is not neutral and that there are significant correlations and linear relationships between per capita GDP and various dimensions of research activity. The significance is particularly notable once the dimensions are relativized according to the number of inhabitants. Statistically significant differences have also been found for different dimensions of research activity between universities located in territories with higher, or lower, per capita GDP."
"With the growing recognition of the importance of knowledge creation, knowledge maps are being regarded as a critical tool for successful knowledge management. However, the various methods of developing knowledge maps mostly depend on unsystematic processes and the judgment of domain experts with a wide range of untapped information. Thus, this research aims to propose a new approach to generate knowledge maps by mining document databases that have hardly been examined, thereby enabling an automatic development process and the extraction of significant implications from the maps. To this end, the accepted research proposal database of the Korea Research Foundation (KRF), which includes a huge knowledge repository of research, is investigated for inducing a keyword-based knowledge map. During the developmental process, text mining plays an important role in extracting meaningful information from documents, and network analysis is applied to visualize the relations between research categories and measure the value of network indices. Five types of knowledge maps (core R&D map, R&D trend map, R&D concentration map, R&D relation map, and R&D cluster map) are developed to explore the main research themes, monitor research trends, discover relations between R&D areas, regions, and universities, and derive clusters of research categories. The results can be used to establish a policy to support promising R&D areas and devise a long-term research plan."

Structure your manuscript properly; however this is not always enough. In this paper we will give tips and tricks to how you should look at the different sections of your manuscript. Decide early which journal you intend to submit to. We strongly suggest that the decision is taken even before the writing procedure is started. This facilitates the process of following guidelines for authors for the journal to which you are submitting. The difficult part to accept - is your paper justified? Lack of clinical relevance will almost certainly lead to rejection. Also if it adds no new knowledge to the subject you should prepare yourself for rejection. It is often hard for the authors to realize this. Also remember the importance of writing your manuscript in fluent English.
"Background: This study uses scientometrics methodology to reveal the status quo and emerging issues of collaboration in health management. Methods: We searched all the articles with the keyword ""health management"" in the period 1999-2011 in Web of Knowledge, then 3067 articles were found. Methods such as Social network analysis (SNA), co-authorship, co-word analysis were used in this study. Results: Analysis of the past 13 years of research in the field of health management indicates that, whether the production of scientific research, or authors, institutions and scientific research collaboration at the national level, collaboration behavior has been growing steadily across all collaboration types. However, the international scientific research cooperation about health management study between countries needs to be further encouraged. 17 researchers can be seen as the academic leaders in this field. 37 research institutions play a vital role in the information dissemination and resources control in health management. The component analysis found that 22 research groups can be regarded as the backbone in this field. The 8 institution groups consisting of 33 institutions form the core of this field. USA, UK and Australia lie in the center by cohesive subgroup analysis; Based on keywords analysis, 44 keywords with high frequency such as care, disease, system and model were involved in the health management field. Conclusions: This study demonstrates that although it is growing steadily, collaboration behavior about health management study needs to be enhanced, especially between different institutions or countries/regions, which would promote the progress and internationalization of health management. Besides, researchers should pay attention to the cooperation of representative scholars and institutions, as well as the hot areas of research, because their experience would help us promote the research development of our nation."
"Measurement: of the impact and influence of medical/scientific journals, and of individual researchers has become more widely practiced in recent decades. Tills is driven, in part, by the increased availability of data regarding citations of research articles, and by increased competition for research funding. Digestive disease research has been identified as a particularly strong discipline in Canada. The authors collected quantitative data on the impact and influence of Canadian digestive health research. The present study involved an analysis of the research impact (Hirsch factor) and research influence (Influence factor) of 106 digestive health researchers in Canada. Rankings of the top 25 researchers on the basis of the two metrics were dominated by the larger research groups at the University of Toronto (Toronto, Ontario), McMaster University (Hamilton, Ontario), and the Universities of Calgary (Calgary, Alberta) and Alberta (Edmonton, Alberta), but with representation by other research groups at the Universities of Manitoba (Winnipeg, Manitoba), Western Ontario (London, Ontario) and McGill University (Montreal, Quebec). Female and male researchers had similar scores for the two metrics, as did basic scientists versus clinical investigators. Strategic recruitment, particularly of established investigators, can have a major impact on the ranking of research groups. Comparing these metrics over different time frames can provide insights into the vulnerabilities and strengths of research groups."
"Aim. The purpose of our study was to describe the dissemination of research into the clinical nursing literature. Background. The literature provides a means of transferring knowledge from a research study through citations of the work by other authors. Design. This was a citation analysis study to explore the dissemination of research into the clinical nursing literature, beginning with the publication of an original research study and including all of the citations to that article through 2009. Methods. The authors searched five academic nursing research journal titles, using CINAHL, for original research reports that had clinical relevance and were published between 1990-1999. The search process yielded a final data set of 28 research articles. For each of the articles, the authors searched three databases, CINAHL, Web of Science(R) and Google Scholar, to determine the citation patterns from the date of publication to August 2009. Results. All of the research studies were cited in articles published in clinical journals although there was a wide range in the number of citations, from 3-80. The 28 research articles had a total of 759 citations; 717 (94.5%) of those citations were in articles published in clinical nursing journals. The median length of time between publication of the original study and the first citation was 1.5 years. Some of the studies were still being cited for 18 years after publication of the original work. Conclusions. All of the original research reports examined in this study were cited in articles in clinical journals, disseminating the research beyond the original work to reach clinicians. Relevance to clinical practice. Clinical nursing journals keep readers up-to-date and informed about new practices in nursing and serve another important role: they disseminate research that is clinically relevant by publishing original studies and papers that cite research reports."
"This paper analyzes more than 30 years of rankings of the best 40 Dutch economists, and examines if performance in terms of weighted publications increased. One of the findings is that over time the differences between top-performers and those lower on the charts decrease, but also that the group of top-performers is small and persistent over the years. Further, the average scores of ranked economists also increase over time. At the same time, new entries usually decrease in the subsequent years. Finally, after 20 years the charts contain 95 % new names and, in general, inclusion in the rankings usually lasts only for about 5 years."
"The issue of whether commercial publishers overcharge libraries for scholarly journal subscriptions has been an important practical concern for researchers and practicing librarians for decades. Recent studies of the issue have not been able to move the research literature toward a consensus but rather have created more controversy. This study addresses this debate in the fields of science, technology, and medicine. More important, an appropriate research methodology is used, including an effective econometric model, a large sample size, and regression analyses by subject area. The study conclusively shows that commercial publishers indeed overcharge libraries by a large margin. Researchers and librarians are urged to move beyond the debate and to focus their research efforts on more open and innovative ways of improving scholarly communication."
"Ghana is a West African country for which apparently there are limited scientometric studies. The objective of this study was to analyze the Ghanaian contribution to knowledge captured in the Thomson Reuters Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED) database from 1936 - 2016. The following data were analyzed: document type, the language of publication, publication trend, Web of Science Subject Categories, Journals, international collaboration, institutions, authors, and highly cited articles. Indicators such as the total number of articles, first author articles, and corresponding author articles were applied to compare publication performance for collaborative countries and institutions. Also, number of single institute articles: number of nationally collaborative articles: number of internationally collaborative articles (S : N : I) were also used to compare publication characteristics of institutions in Ghana. Results showed that publication trend increased from 1998 to 2015, with researches focusing on health and medicine. PLoS One was the top productive journal, and the most collaborative country for Ghana articles was the USA. Contributions from the University of Ghana were ranked the top one institution for Ghana articles, and higher citation papers were found in international collaborations. In conclusion, the contribution to knowledge of Ghanaian authors is massive in the areas of public, environmental and occupational health and tropical medicine but the impact factor is higher for immunology, infectious diseases, and microbiology articles. Therefore, Ghanaian authors are encouraged to publish more articles in high impact factor journals with Thomson Reuters Scientific indexing in order to have their researches recognized by the existing international databases."
"We explore the joint relationship that organizational environment and individual proactive behavior have with the research performance of business school academics. We draw upon sociology of science research, ""new careers"" literature, and social capital research to build a multilevel model of individual research productivity emergence. The study looks at the interplay between organizational scripts and individual strategies as part of a microfoundations research program, and seeks to create consensus on the relative importance of each antecedent in supporting research outcomes. Our hypotheses are tested using a sample of 500 academics randomly selected from 25 research-intensive U.S. business schools ranked at the top of the University of Texas at Dallas ranking. The findings of the study demonstrate that both organizational environment and individual behavior influence the research performance of U.S. business school faculties, with collaboration behavior being the most important driver of research outcomes. These findings can inform decision making for academics at all stages of a research-active career. We hope that the developmental practices based on these results will become part of doctoral students' training and will facilitate the students' socialization into the research profession."
"This article reviews the ways through which subscription-based scholarly journals have converted to open access. The methodology included a comprehensive literature review of both published and 'grey' literature, such as blog posts and press releases. Eight interviews were also conducted with stakeholders representing different parts of the scholarly publishing landscape. Strategies of conversion for different types of journals are presented at multiple levels (publishers, national, research funders, organizational, and so on). The identified scenarios are split into two main categories, those that rely heavily on article processing charges and those that can operate without relying on author-side financing. Despite there being interesting and important shared traits among many converted journals, individual circumstances largely dictate what options for conversion are viable for a journal. There is no single solution that works for every journal but rather a broad selection of different solutions, among which selection should be well informed."
"This article studies interdisciplinarity and the intellectual base of 34 literature journals using citation data from Web of Science. Data from two time periods, 1978-1987 and 1998-2007 were compared to reveal changes in the interdisciplinary citing of monographs. The study extends the analysis to non-source publications; using the classification of monographs to show changes in the intellectual base. There is support for increased interdisciplinary citing of sources, especially to the social sciences, and changes in the intellectual base reflect this. The results are explained using theories on the intellectual and social organization of scientific fields and the use of bibliometric methods on the humanities is discussed. The article demonstrates how citation analysis can provide insights into the communication patterns and intellectual structure of scholarly fields in the arts and humanities."
"Research suggests that new doctoral graduates face increased publication pressure to achieve tenure: doctoral programs may have also increased this expectation. We examined whether faculty graduating before and after the year 2000 differed significantly in total publications, peer-reviewed publications, and first-authored publications as of the year they graduated with their doctoral degrees along with peer-reviewed publications as of tenure. A sample of 197 curriculum vitae was retrieved from educational psychology departmental websites across the 24 universities; vitae were coded for year the faculty member completed his/her doctorate and total number of publications, number of peer-reviewed publications and number of first-authored, peer-reviewed publications. Results indicated that faculty who graduated in the year 2000 and beyond had a significantly greater number of total publications-more peer-reviewed publications, more first-authored, peer-reviewed publications as of the year they graduated with their doctoral degrees, along with more peer-reviewed publications as of tenure. Publication productivity among doctoral graduates of educational psychology programs at research universities before and after the year 2000."
"A new visual representation of the response time, i.e., the time elapsed between the publication year and the date of the first citation of a paper, is provided. This presentation can be used to detect and describe different paradigmatic types of reception speed for scientific journals."
"The contribution deals with the issue of the international productivity and visibility of the social sciences in Central and Eastern European (CEE) countries. The reasons why the social sciences in CEE countries lag behind in being more internationalised stem not only from the past, but also the present. The intellectual potential of the social sciences is often neither fully acknowledged nor effectively used by different groups of social actors. There is also a lack of institutional support from R&D policy decision-makers to encourage social scientists to publish more abroad and to establish excellent networks beyond national borders. In the paper, the main focus is national R&D evaluation systems. R&D evaluation systems play a crucial role in the allocation of financial support to scientists, the promotion of individual scientific careers, ensuring disciplinary (or interdisciplinary) standards etc. Last but not least, it is impossible to fully understand the state-of-the-art in the social sciences' international productivity and visibility in CEE countries without explaining the context of how these national R&D evaluation systems function. Some analytical data are used to illustrate the international orientation of social scientists. These data warn that the great expectations that social scientists from this part of Europe would easily ""break through"" into publication channels in the West and thereby have a big scientific impact have yet to be realised."
"Objective: To compare basic bibliometric indicators on the topic of smoking by Spanish authors in Web of Science (WoS) and Scopus (2000 to 2009). Methods: The search was performed in SCI-Expanded and Scopus (key words ""smok*"" OR ""tobac*""). Results: Total annual mean of documents was 41 +/- 12 for WoS vs 60 +/- 16 for Scopus (p = 0.007). The collaboration index (CI) increased during the study period in both databases. The CI annual mean was 9.41 +/- 2.73 in WoS vs 7.12 +/- 1.52 in Scopus (p = 0.029). The number of citations rose over time in both databases, but citations were more recent in Scopus, although the citation/articles index was higher in WoS (14,47 vs 11,50). Conclusions: We found a higher number of journals, articles, signing authors and total citations in Scopus, but the signing authors/articles and institutions/articles indices were higher in WoS. The CI increased annually during the study period in both databases (the CI annual mean was higher in WoS). Citations were higher for older articles but more recent in Scopus (citation/articles index was higher in WoS)."
"Contemporary science has been characterized by an exponential growth in publications and a rise of team science. At the same time, there has been an increase in the number of awarded PhD degrees, which has not been accompanied by a similar expansion in the number of academic positions. In such a competitive environment, an important measure of academic success is the ability to maintain a long active career in science. In this paper, we study workforce trends in three scientific disciplines over half a century. We find dramatic shortening of careers of scientists across all three disciplines. The time over which half of the cohort has left the field has shortened from 35 y in the 1960s to only 5 y in the 2010s. In addition, we find a rapid rise (from 25 to 60% since the 1960s) of a group of scientists who spend their entire career only as supporting authors without having led a publication. Altogether, the fraction of entering researchers who achieve full careers has diminished, while the class of temporary scientists has escalated. We provide an interpretation of our empirical results in terms of a survival model from which we infer potential factors of success in scientific career survivability. Cohort attrition can be successfully modeled by a relatively simple hazard probability function. Although we find statistically significant trends between survivability and an author's early productivity, neither productivity nor the citation impact of early work or the level of initial collaboration can serve as a reliable predictor of ultimate survivability."
"The study provides an overview of the research activity carried out in the field of cybernetics. To do so, all research papers from 1997 to 2011 (16,445 research papers) under the category of ""Computer Science, Cybernetics"" of Web of Science have been processed using our in-house software which is developed specifically for this purpose. Among its multiple capabilities, this software analyses individual and compound keywords, quantifies productivity taking into account the work distribution, estimates the impact of each article and determines the collaborations established at different scales. Keywords analysis identifies the evolution of the most important research topics in the field of cybernetics and their specificity in biological aspects, as well as the research topics with lesser interest. The analysis of productivity, impact and collaborations provides a framework to assess research activity in a specific and realistic context. The geographical and institutional distribution of publications reveals the leading countries and research centres, analysing their relation to main research journals. Moreover, collaborations analysis reveals great differences in terms of internationalization and complexity of research networks. The results of this study may be very useful for the characterization and the decisions made by research in the field of cybernetics."
"Objectives: To identify and analyze the 100 most-cited articles in orthodontics indexed in the Web of Science Category of ""Dental, Oral Surgery and Medicine'' from 1946 to 2016. Materials and Methods: On hundred articles were identified in a search of the database of the ISI Web of Science and Journal Citation Reports, applying the truncated search term ""orthodon*.'' Records were manually refined and normalized to unify terms and to remove typographical, transcription, and/or indexing errors. Results: The 100 most-cited articles were published between 1946 and 2012, with numbers of citations ranging from 115 to 881. Of the 251 authors participating, 87.65% published a single work, while three authors published four works. Most of the authors with several citations were from the United States, although the University of Oslo produced the highest number of frequently cited works. Most of the articles were clinical studies, and the most frequently cited topic was mini-implants. It was noted that self-citation could be a potential cause of bias in bibliometric analysis. Conclusions: This bibliometric citation analysis reveals new, useful, and interesting information about scientific progress in the field of orthodontics."
"Purpose - This purpose of this paper is to discuss some of the problems that exist with Google Scholar, particularly regarding content spurn and citation spam. Design/methodology/approach - The paper provides an analysis of how Google Scholar has been duped by real but manipulated documents and reference lists, as Well as by fake documents and references. Details of research regarding the duping of Google Scholar is presented and a possible solut ion is differed. Findings - Researchers showed how easy it was to dupe Google Scholar. In one case, the researchers added invisible words to the first page of one of their conference papers (using the well-known white letter on white screen/paper technique), and modified the content and bibliography of some of their already published papers, then posted them on the web to see if Google Scholar would bite, i.e. would improve their rank position, and increase the number of citations that the targeted papers received. and the number of papers published by the authors. Google Scholar did bite. While the size. of Google Scholar kept growing at an impressive rate, the intellectual growth of the Google Scholar software has been stunted. Originality/value - The paper makes the point that the best move from Google Scholar would be to realise that the existing metadata created by competent human indexers, cataloguers, librarians and other information professionals for tens of millions of scholarly documents is far superior to the parser's results."
"The Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (JASN) gives authors submitting original research the option of suggesting qualified reviewers or those they wish to exclude. This historical habit often leaves us wondering whether author preferences correlate with reviewer recommendations and whether differences related to reviewer selection affect decisions by editors. In a self-study presented here, we found that author-suggested reviewers, as a group, make more positive recommendations than editor-suggested reviewers (P = 0.01), although the difference disappears when recommendations are compared with those of editor-suggested reviewers of the same manuscript (P = 0.081). The distribution of recommendations by author-excluded reviewers, as a group, did not differ from those by editor-suggested reviewers; however, author-excluded reviewers impart significantly more negative recommendations than other reviewers of the same manuscript (P = 0.029). We further explored whether such differences result from individual reviewer tendencies to give generally more positive or more negative recommendations than editor-suggested reviewers and found no such tendency. Finally, editorial decisions on manuscripts reviewed by author-suggested or author-excluded reviewers do not differ from those decisions on manuscripts assigned but not reviewed by them. JASN's policy of editors making decisions independent from individual reviewer recommendations minimizes the effect of selection bias on publication decisions."
"Objective: Disseminating high-impact scholarship is a critical task for many social work academics. Although the factors that contribute to this process have been investigated in other disciplines, there is a paucity of equivalent research in social work. This longitudinal study addresses this gap in the literature by examining the effects of coauthorship, database indexing, and article length on subsequent citation counts, a widely used measure of scholarly impact. Based upon the extant research, we hypothesized that all three factors would be associated with a greater number of citations 5 years after publication. Method: The sample consisted of 3,066 articles, published inclusively from 2005 to 2009 in 18 disciplinary social work journals. Multilevel negative binomial regression was used to model the effects of each factor on 5-year citation counts. Results: The findings generally supported the hypotheses. Articles were more likely to be cited in subsequent scholarship if they were (a) written by 3 or more authors, (b) retrievable from more databases, and (c) longer. Conclusions: The results raise the possibility that authors interested in high-impact scholarship might benefit from working in authorship teams to create longer papers containing more original ideas, and then submitting the resulting manuscripts to journals that are indexed in multiple electronic databases."
"This article describes an evaluation of the National Science Foundation's Small Grants for Exploratory Research (SGER) programme conducted for NSF by SRI International (a non-profit research company). SGER was a 16-year programme sponsored by NSF and operating across the agency from 1990 until 2006 to encourage programme directors to invest in high-risk, high-reward research that might not pass the traditional peer review process. This article provides a detailed background of SGER; a description of the outcomes of the programme; details about the methodology used to evaluate the SGER programme; and the findings of the evaluation. The analysis shows that SGER was highly successful in supporting research projects that produced transformative results as measured by citations and as reported through expert interviews and a survey. However, the NSF programme directors as a whole underutilized the tool for most of the years it was in operation spending far less than the allowable funds allocated to exploratory research; this suggests that internal actions to take risks may not have been rewarded. Moreover, the programme itself was successful beyond expectations. A high-risk programme would be expected to have transformative results in just a few cases. SGER had transformative research results tied to more than 10% of projects. This suggests that programme managers remained risk averse and continued to support projects that were likely to produce positive outcomes."
"I discuss how, given a certain number of articles and citations of these articles, the h-index and the g-index are affected by the level of concentration of the citations. This offers the opportunity for a comparison between these 2 indices from a new perspective."
"We explore if and how Microsoft Academic (MA) could be used for bibliometric analyses. First, we examine the Academic Knowledge API (AK API), an interface to access MA data, and compare it to Google Scholar (GS). Second, we perform a comparative citation analysis of researchers by normalizing data from MA and Scopus. We find that MA offers structured and rich metadata, which facilitates data retrieval, handling and processing. In addition, the AK API allows retrieving frequency distributions of citations. We consider these features to be a major advantage of MA over GS. However, we identify four main limitations regarding the available metadata. First, MA does not provide the document type of a publication. Second, the ""fields of study'' are dynamic, too specific and field hierarchies are incoherent. Third, some publications are assigned to incorrect years. Fourth, the metadata of some publications did not include all authors. Nevertheless, we show that an average-based indicator (i.e. the journal normalized citation score; JNCS) as well as a distribution-based indicator (i.e. percentile rank classes; PR classes) can be calculated with relative ease using MA. Hence, normalization of citation counts is feasible with MA. The citation analyses in MA and Scopus yield uniform results. The JNCS and the PR classes are similar in both databases, and, as a consequence, the evaluation of the researchers' publication impact is congruent in MA and Scopus. Given the fast development in the last year, we postulate that MA has the potential to be used for full-fledged bibliometric analyses."
"Objectives/HypothesisDuplicate publicationdeemed highly unethicalis the reproduction of substantial content in another article by the same authors. In 1999, Rosenthal et al. identified an 8.5% incidence of duplicate articles in two otolaryngology journals. We explored the current incidence in three otolaryngology journals in North America and Europe. Study DesignRetrospective literature review. MethodsIndex articles in 2008 in Archives of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery, Laryngoscope, and Clinical Otolaryngology were searched using MEDLINE. Potential duplicate publications in 2006 through 2010 were identified using the first, second, and last authors' names. Three authors independently investigated suspected duplicate publicationsclassifying them by degree of duplication. ResultsOf 358 index articles screened, 75 (20.9%) had 119 potential duplicates from 2006 to 2010. Full review of these 119 potential duplicates revealed a total of 40 articles with some form of redundancy (33.6% of the potential duplicates) involving 27 index articles (7.5% of 358 index articles); one (0.8%) dual publication (identical or nearly identical data and conclusions to the index article); three (2.5%) suspected dual publications (less than 50% new data and same conclusions); and 36 (30.3%) publications with salami-slicing (portion of the index article data repeated) were obtained. Further analysis compared the likelihood of duplicate publication by study source and subspecialty within otolaryngology. ConclusionsThe incidence of duplicate publication has not significantly changed over 10 years. Salami-slicing was a concerning practice, with no cross-referencing in 61% of these cases. Detecting and eliminating redundant publications is a laborious task, but it is essential in upholding the journal quality and research integrity."
"The exploratory analysis developed in this paper relies on the hypothesis that each editor possesses some power in the definition of the editorial policy of her journal. Consequently if the same scholar sits on the board of editors of two journals, those journals could have some common elements in their editorial policies. The proximity of the editorial policies of two scientific journals can be assessed by the number of common editors sitting on their boards. A database of all editors of ECONLIT journals is used. The structure of the network generated by interlocking editorship is explored by applying the instruments of network analysis. Evidence has been found of a compact network containing different components. This is interpreted as the result of a plurality of perspectives about the appropriate methods for the investigation of problems and the construction of theories within the domain of economics."
"Recent studies have concluded that American contributions to science literature have been in relative decline, whereas contributions from other parts of the world such as the European Union and Asia have increased. Is the same true for the areas of bibliometrics, informetrics and scientometrics? This study investigates the growth and geographic distribution of metrics research for the period 1987-2008. Similar to studies of other disciplines or science in general, the findings reveal that the United States continues to dominate, but there has been a recent relative decline in North American contributions overall. European and Asian contributions have grown substantially. National and institutional collaborations that contribute to this growth do not necessarily follow close geographic proximity, although European nations have been more active with international collaborations overall, both within Europe and elsewhere.

National and international rankings of universities are now an accepted part of the higher education landscape. Rankings aggregate different performance measures into a single scale and therefore depend on the methods and weights used to aggregate. The most common method is to scale each variable relative to the highest performing entity prior to aggregating. Other approaches involve transforming the data to allow for the different spread of the variables. This paper evaluates alternative methods and the sensitivity to weights with illustrations from the Times Higher Education and Shanghai Jiao Tong rankings of universities and the U21 rankings of national systems of higher education. The authors conclude that transforming the data clouds interpretation; the choice of included variables is more important than the weights attached to them; and there are limitations in extending ranking to a large number of universities/countries.
"For measuring multilevel impact, we introduce the distributive h-indices, which balance two important components (breadth and strength) of multilevel impact at various citing levels. After exploring the theoretical properties of these indices, we studied two cases: 57 library and information science (LIS) journals and social science research in 38 European countries/territories. Results reveal that there are approximate power-law relations between distributive h-indices and some underlying citation indicators, such as total citations, total citing entities, and the h-index. Distributive h-indices provide comprehensive measures for multilevel impact, and lead to a potential tool for citation analysis, particularly at aggregative levels."
"Purpose The purpose of this paper is to contribute to the body of knowledge on how research evaluation in different national and organisational contexts affects, often in unintended ways, research and publication practices. In particular, it looks at the development of book publication in the social sciences and humanities (SSH) in the Czech Republic since 2004, when a performance-based system of evaluation was introduced, up to the present. Design/methodology/approach The paper builds upon ethnographic research complemented by the analysis of Czech science policy documents, data available in the governmental database Information Register of R&D results and formal and informal interviews with expert evaluators and other stakeholders in the research system. It further draws on the authors' own experience as scholars, who have also over the years participated in a number of evaluation procedures as peers and experts. Findings The number of books published by researchers in SSH based at Czech institutions has risen considerably in reaction to the pressure for productivity that is inscribed into the evaluation methodology and has resulted in the rise of in-house publishing by researchers' own research institution, fake internationalisation using foreign low-quality presses as the publication venue, and the development of a culture of orphaned books that have no readers. Practical implications In the Czech Republic robust and internationally harmonised bibliometric data regarding books would definitely help to create a form of research evaluation that would stimulate meaningful scholarly book production. At the same time, better-resourced and better-designed peer review evaluation is needed. Originality/value This is the first attempt to analyse in detail the conditions and consequences the Czech performance-based research evaluation system has for SSH book publication. The paper demonstrates that often discussed harming of SSH and book-writing in particular by performance-based IF-centred research evaluation does not necessarily manifest in declining numbers of publications. On the contrary, the number of books published may increase at the cost of producing more texts of questionable scholarly quality."
"While it may be useful to consider the development of new topics in teaching the responsible conduct of research (RCR), it is perhaps equally important to reconsider the traditionally taught core topic areas in both more nuanced and broader ways. This paper takes the topic of authorship as an example. Through the description of two specific cases from sociocultural anthropology, ideas about credit and responsibility are examined. It is suggested that placing more focus on the array of meanings found in the act of authoring might help students see themselves as part of a wider community both of scientists and beyond science."
"To ensure the ethical design and conduct of human subjects research, universities, professional societies, licensing bodies, and journals should adopt more effective ways of integrating a lively understanding of personal responsibility into professional research practice. Rigorous courses in bioethics and human subjects research at the undergraduate as well as graduate and professional levels should be developed and expanded to include ongoing engagement and case reviews for investigators at all levels of experience.

By means of 10 simple lessons the problems and pitfalls of getting a manuscript published are considered. Working through each lesson in turn will provide the reader with a step-by-step guide to effective publishing in the biomedical arena.
"This study analyses the extent of gold open access (OA) publishing options in 377 anthropology journals by applying a six-level coding scheme (0=non-transparent publishing, 5=fully OA, i.e., free to read and publish without embargo). This analysis is meant to simplify the process of identifying OA journal publishing options in the discipline of anthropology, in addition to sharing findings on some of the prominent issues in OA publishing as they relate to anthropology journals, including non-transparency among publishers and the prevalence and price of article processing charges (APCs). We conclude that publishers should be more transparent about their OA publishing options and policies by providing conspicuous and straightforward information to potential authors. Further, we find that in the anthropology scholarly communication ecosystem, APCs for hybrid journals are more expensive than those for fully gold OA journals, thus contradicting the assumption that gold OA is more costly to researchers."
"Being the most proliferative journal of oncology a cancer research of the past decade, the Open Access journal Oncotarget had reached more than 20,000 publications and a relatively high impact factor score in the past years. In 2018, the journal citation report decided to withdraw the status of an impact factor journal. Since there was a large discussion in the scientific community and specific reasons for the withdrawal were not stated, this bibliometric analysis was performed to assess if Oncotarget exhibits any differences in its bibliometric structure compared to other journals. For this purpose, we used the New Quality and Quantity Indices in Sciences platform and analyzed 20,000 Oncotarget articles. Density equalizing mapping technique helps to construct maps of cancer research in Oncotarget and shows that it has led to a unique global landscape which is not asymmetrically dominated by the Western hemisphere but exhibits a publishing architecture with a pronounced emphasis on Chinese articles."
"Purpose - Google Scholar Citations (GSC) provides an institutional affiliation link which groups together authors who belong to the same institution. The purpose of this paper is to ascertain whether this feature is able to identify and normalize all the institutions entered by the authors, and whether it is able to assign all researchers to their own institution correctly. Design/methodology/approach - Systematic queries to GSC's internal search box were performed under two different forms (institution name and institutional e-mail web domain) in September 2015. The whole Spanish academic system (82 institutions) was used as a test. Additionally, specific searches to companies (Google) and world-class universities were performed to identify and classify potential errors in the functioning of the feature. Findings - Although the affiliation tool works well for most institutions, it is unable to detect all existing institutions in the database, and it is not always able to create a unique standardized entry for each institution. Additionally, it also fails to group all the authors who belong to the same institution. A wide variety of errors have been identified and classified. Research limitations/implications - Even though the analyzed sample is good enough to empirically answer the research questions initially proposed, a more comprehensive study should be performed to calibrate the real volume of the errors. Practical implications - The discovered affiliation link errors prevent institutions from being able to access the profiles of all their respective authors using the institutions lists offered by GSC. Additionally, it introduces a shortcoming in the navigation features of Google Scholar which may impair web user experience. Social implications - Some institutions (mainly universities) are under-represented in the affiliation feature provided by GSC. This fact might jeopardize the visibility of institutions as well as the use of this feature in bibliometric or webometric analyses. Originality/value - This work proves inconsistencies in the affiliation feature provided by GSC. A whole national university system is systematically analyzed and several queries have been used to reveal errors in its functioning. The completeness of the errors identified and the empirical data examined are the most exhaustive to date regarding this topic. Finally, some recommendations about how to correctly fill in the affiliation data (both for authors and institutions) and how to improve this feature are provided as well."
"Bibliometric analysis provides a novel and effective method to examine the global literature on nursing workforce and migration. A range of key themes, role advancement and growth, care settings and services, international mobility and migration, workforce retention, European Union mobility, career progression, and substitution were identified as well as the key authors contributing to this domain of nursing scholarship. To increase the profession's influence at the policy table, research on workforce, migration and mobility is needed."
"The Research Excellence Framework (REF) is the latest attempt by the UK government to evaluate research in UK universities. A key component of this is the evaluation of the economic and societal impact of research. We discuss the nature of such impact and how, in an ideal world, we would measure it. We then evaluate a number of REF case studies and conclude that they are a long way from being an accurate reflection of impact. They are primarily narratives, with little hard information and no attempt to discount over time or spatially, or to evaluate against a counterfactual. But the REF deserves credit for focusing attention on impact, and it must be recognized that at this point in time, a first best methodology is not possible. Both the research councils and the universities need to begin collecting data which will facilitate improved analyses in the future."
"It has been proposed that the scientific literature purges itself of articles known to be fraudulent. To test this, an investigation was carried out of post-retraction citations over a 19-year period in the Breuning case. On 10 March 2008 a cited reference search was conducted (all languages, all document types) using the name 'Breuning SE*'. The time limit was 1989-2007 with an option to exclude self-citations. The search included the ISI Web of Science Database including the Science Citation Index Expanded, the Social Sciences Citations Index and the Arts & Humanities Citation Index. To ascertain the citation context, citations of Breuning were classified by two raters as affirmative, negative or neutral. For the period 1989-2000 both negative and affirmative citations were found. For the period 2001-2006 only affirmative citations (even to retracted articles) were found, some in journals with higher impact factors than those citing the case as fraudulent. In spite of the small number of citations of Breuning's articles, it is alarming that the affirmative citing of fraudulent research has not completely ceased but continues 24 years post-retraction (retracted 1982, cited 2006). While the limitations of a single case study are conceded, the results challenge the belief of scientific literature purging itself of fraudulent material. Retraction databases and widespread availability of computer software to check lists of references free of charge in any database or the internet are called for. Moreover, if a paper is never formally retracted, software for searching author names in the internet for fully investigated and proven scientific misconduct might be developed. The ethical guidelines on duplicate publication for purposes of disseminating the information as widely as possible should be reviewed."
"The present study reports on the research performance of the Botanical Survey of India (BSI) between 1971 and 2010, based on number of parameters, including publications, citations, impact in terms of average citation per paper, international and national collaboration output, share of publication by different circles of BSI, type of communication, most preferred journals, highly cited papers, authorship pattern and most productive authors. The study analyses 40 years (1971-2010) of publication data drawn from Web of Science (SCI-Expanded). A total of 423 papers were published in 40 years (10.57 papers per year), which received 892 citations with an average of 2.1 citations per paper, h-index of 12 and a p-index of 12.34. It has been observed that during 1977-1986, number of publications was comparatively better. Between 1987 and 2005, a long recession was observed; again it is on rise from 2006 onwards, the citations were following almost the same trend. BSI has published 72 and 38 collaborative papers with involvement of 56 national and 22 foreign institutions respectively. Current Science is the most preferred journal, Council of Scientific and Industrial Research is major domestic collaborator (21 papers), University of Rhode Island, Kingston is the major foreign collaborator (11 papers), USA is the major collaborator country (16 papers) and BSI, Kolkata has contributed maximum number of publications (41%)."
"An institutional repository (IR) is a system for archiving digital research outputs such as scholarly papers. While using this system is a simple way to return the benefits of academic research to society, the number of papers currently archived in institutional repositories across the world is very small. We have, therefore, developed a system that can increase the number of papers archived in institutional repositories. The main aim of this system is to reduce the workload of researchers and librarians in paper registration for an IR by using external databases. As a result of our trial implementation and evaluation of the system, we found that its application resulted in a fourfold increase in the number of papers registered in a month without decreasing the working efficiency of the participating librarians. Moreover, by analyzing the log data for the system's implementation, we have acquired further knowledge related to researchers who need librarians' support in paper registration with an IR.

"The European Higher Education Area (EHEA) has implied a major transformation of university studies in European countries. The aim of this study was to assess the satisfaction of university teachers in the area of Health Sciences with the convergence process to determine positive and negative aspects in their practices. The sample was composed of 1,361 teachers of Spanish public universities. They all participated in an ad hoc survey that included questions pertaining to the following issues: a) personal and professional information, b) general and institutional aspects, c) aspects related to teaching, research, and administrative work, d) methodology and the teaching-learning process, e) assessment of students, f) training of teachers, and g) coordination, organization, and resources at the school. Results reveal that teachers are not totally satisfied with the way the EHEA is being established. In conclusion, certain changes would be necessary to achieve real convergence between countries.

"Peer-reviewed publications are the primary mechanism for sharing scientific results. The current peer-review process is, however, fraught with many problems that undermine the pace, validity, and credibility of science. We highlight five salient problems: (1) reviewers are expected to have comprehensive expertise; (2) reviewers do not have sufficient access to methods and materials to evaluate a study; (3) reviewers are neither identified nor acknowledged; (4) there is no measure of the quality of a review; and (5) reviews take a lot of time, and once submitted cannot evolve. We propose that these problems can be resolved by making the following changes to the review process. Distributing reviews to many reviewers would allow each reviewer to focus on portions of the article that reflect the reviewer's specialty or area of interest and place less of a burden on any one reviewer. Providing reviewers materials and methods to perform comprehensive evaluation would facilitate transparency, greater scrutiny, and replication of results. Acknowledging reviewers makes it possible to quantitatively assess reviewer contributions, which could be used to establish the impact of the reviewer in the scientific community. Quantifying review quality could help establish the importance of individual reviews and reviewers as well as the submitted article. Finally, we recommend expediting post-publication reviews and allowing for the dialog to continue and flourish in a dynamic and interactive manner. We argue that these solutions can be implemented by adapting existing features from open-source software management and social networking technologies. We propose a model of an open, interactive review system that quantifies the significance of articles, the quality of reviews, and the reputation of reviewers."
"The Watt Review takes a first-principles approach to how the research and engagement inventive system should be designed for universities in a contemporary setting. Despite raising many important policy issues, the Review misses an opportunity to engage in a discussion about: changing the anachronistic teaching base-funding formula that also funds research; introducing research brokerage and triage services; and changing the engagement culture among academics. Opportunities, currently unquantifiable, are currently being lost through a mechanistic application of intellectual property policies to translation."
"Using the articles published in 24 periodicals included in the branch of business fields of the University of Texas at Dallas (UTD) journal list (2000-2012) as the data source, this article establishes the collaboration network of scholars of six different disciplines (i.e., business administration, management science, marketing, accounting, finance, and information science), analyzes the features of the network by utilizing the social network analysis approach, and studies the mode of interdisciplinary collaboration among scholars. The network feature analysis reveals that the collaboration networks of the six disciplines are all sparse, and collaboration is established more in the subgroup. The disciplines of business administration, accounting, and finance have the poorest collaboration network connectivity. The collaboration networks of the six disciplines in business fields all have obvious core-periphery structure; the small-world phenomenon exists in the collaboration networks of business administration and information science. The interdisciplinary research on the scholars of business fields indicates that the interdisciplinary collaboration among information science scholars takes up the maximum proportion and is carried out principally in collaboration of the two disciplines. The collaboration between scholars in management science and information science accounts for the highest proportion."
"The h-index has received wide attention in recent years. The area under the citation function is divided by the h-index into three parts, representing h-squared, excess and h-tail citations. The h-index by itself does not carry information for excess and h-tail citations, which can play an even more dominant role than h-index in determining the citation curve, and therefore it is necessary to examine the relations among them. A triangle mapping technique is proposed here to map the three percentages of these citations onto a point within a regular triangle. By viewing the distribution of mapping points, shapes of the citation functions can be studied in a perceivable form. As an example, the distribution of the mapping points for 100 most prolific economists is studied by this technique."
"Introduction Microsurgical reconstruction of the breast represents an area of continual evolution, as new autologous flaps are introduced and principles are refined. This progression can be demonstrated by bibliometric analysis of the scientific literature. Methods The top 10 plastic surgery journals were determined by impact factor (IF). Each issue of every journal from 1993 to 2013 was accessed directly, and all articles discussing microsurgery on the female breast were classified by authors' geographic location, study design, and level of evidence (LOE, I-V). The productivity index and productivity share of each geographic region was calculated based on number of articles published and IF. Results A total of 706 breast microsurgery articles were analyzed. There was a significant increase in microsurgical breast research (p < 0.01), with an average 33.6 +/- 31.1 articles per year and a mean increase of 4.4 articles per year. Most research was of lower LOE, with level I constituting 0.14% and level II constituting 5.21% of all articles. United States contributed the most research with 336.4 articles, followed by Western Europe with 242.2. However, Western Europe experienced the greatest increase in productivity share, with + 0.50 +/- 0.29 growth, while United States demonstrated the greatest decrease in productivity share with 1.23 +/- 0.31 growth. Among autologous flaps, transverse rectus abdominis muscle research had the greatest yearly publication volume until 2002, when overtaken by deep inferior epigastric perforator flap research. Conclusion Over the 21-year study period, the United States not only contributed the greatest volume of research on female breast microsurgery but also demonstrated the greatest decline in research productivity. Efforts should be made to increase the LOE in breast microsurgery research."
"Microsoft Academic is a free citation index that allows large scale data collection. This combination makes it useful for scientometric research. Previous studies have found that its citation counts tend to be slightly larger than those of Scopus but smaller than Google Scholar, with disciplinary variations. This study reports the largest and most systematic analysis so far, of 172,752 articles in 29 large journals chosen from different specialisms. From Scopus citation counts, Microsoft Academic citation counts and Mendeley reader counts for articles published 2007-2017, Microsoft Academic found a slightly more (6%) citations than Scopus overall and especially for the current year (51%). It found fewer citations than Mendeley readers overall (59%), and only 7% as many for the current year. Differences between journals were probably due to field preprint sharing cultures or journal policies rather than broad disciplinary differences. (c) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."
"A select set of highly cited publications from the National Institutes of Health (NIH) HIV/AIDS Clinical Trials Networks was used to illustrate the integration of time interval and citation data, modeling the progression, dissemination, and uptake of primary research findings. Following a process marker approach, the pace of initial utilization of this research was measured as the time from trial conceptualization, development and implementation, through results dissemination and uptake. Compared to earlier studies of clinical research, findings suggest that select HIV/AIDS trial results are disseminated and utilized relatively rapidly. Time-based modeling of publication results as they meet specific citation milestones enabled the observation of points at which study results were present in the literature summarizing the evidence in the field. Evaluating the pace of clinical research, results dissemination, and knowledge uptake in synthesized literature can help establish realistic expectations for the time course of clinical trials research and their relative impact toward influencing clinical practice."
"This paper analyzes the impact of several influencing factors on scientific production of researchers. Time related statistical models for the period of 1996 to 2010 are estimated to assess the impact of research funding and other determinant factors on the quantity and quality of the scientific output of individual funded researchers in Canadian natural sciences and engineering. Results confirm a positive impact of funding on the quantity and quality of the publications. In addition, the existence of the Matthew effect is partially confirmed such that the rich get richer. Although a positive relation between the career age and the rate of publications is observed, it is found that the career age negatively affects the quality of works. Moreover, the results suggest that young researchers who work in large teams are more likely to produce high quality publications. We also found that even though academic researchers produce higher quantity of papers it is the researchers with industrial affiliation whose work is of higher quality. Finally, we observed that strategic, targeted and high priority funding programs lead to higher quantity and quality of publications."
"Objective: This study sought to update norms for scholarly publication and citation impact for Australian Group of Eight (Go8) university psychology academics published by McNally (2010). Method: Publication and citation data for 279 Go8 psychology academics were extracted using the Scopus and Google Scholar databases. Norms for career-wise publications, citations, and the h-index were developed for each academic level (from Lecturer to Professor), and eight-year publication counts for 2009-2016 were compared with the 2001-2008 figures reported by McNally. Results: Evidence of a steep increase in scholarly productivity was found relative to McNally (2010), and new norms were generated. There was notable variation between psychology subdisciplines, with neuroscience and clinical science academics typically having higher publication and citation counts than their cognitive psychology peers. Conclusions: Norms for scholarly productivity and citation impact among Australian psychology academics have undergone substantial change in recent years. Caveats concerning the application of research metrics are discussed."
Harvard's approach to deposit in their digital repository and further ways to engage faculty are described. Current approaches to self-archiving at Harvard are proving successful according to the number of participating faculty but require a high degree of mediation; a model for integrating self-archiving into the academic authoring workflow is proposed - the model has the added benefit of creating a comprehensive institutional 'view' or record of published scholarship along with other efficiencies for faculty authors.
"In this paper we transfer the Elo rating system, which is widely accepted in chess, sports and other disciplines, to rank scientific journals. The advantage of the Elo system is the explicit consideration of the factor time and the history of a journal's ranking performance. Most other rankings that are commonly applied neglect this fact. The Elo ranking methodology can easily be applied to any metric, published on a regular basis, to rank journals. We illustrate the approach using the SNIP indicator based on citation data from Scopus. Our data set consists of more than 20 000 journals from many scientific fields for the period from 1999 to 2015. We show that the Elo approach produces similar but by no means identical rankings compared to other rankings based on the SNIP alone or the Tournament Method. Especially the rank order for rather 'middle-class' journals can tremendously change. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."
"Manuscript peer review is fundamental to the evaluation and dissemination of modern science; it is the process whereby good science is enhanced and bad science is dismissed. Very little objective evidence, however, has been amassed to guide the manuscript peer review process. Rather, it is learned by experience and mentoring: by doing reviews, receiving reviews of one's own work, and by obtaining feedback from seasoned reviewers. Here, I lay out my perspective on this cornerstone of the scientific endeavor. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved."
"Research wrongdoing undermines scientific integrity, occurs widely, and takes many forms. We interviewed 135 NIH principal investigators who reported witnessing and responding to research wrongdoing. They reported taking a variety of actions, including formal notification of institutional officials, peer shaming, and one-on-one discussions with their peers to address wrongdoing that ranged from improper attribution of authorship to falsification, fabrication, and plagiarism. Unexpectedly, administrative mismanagement in handling allegations appeared more prevalent than any of the other forms of wrongdoing reported. Institutions may lack effective or efficient processes for managing even the most egregious cases of research wrongdoing. To assist institutions in designing effective, nimble programs, we suggest resources from which institutional officials may draw."
"Research in communication has recently gained relevance, leading to the development of a significant and specialised corpus of studies. Along these lines, this work focuses on radio studies from the perspective of the scientific community - an innovative approach in the framework of communication meta-research. Starting with the outcomes of an initial survey, an in-depth study was then conducted to focus on the importance, themes and quality of radio research. We looked into the 31 most important authors of contributions published in scientific journals (1980-2013) to understand their perceptions and impressions about Spanish research. This study helped confirm that radio research is still a minority and individual endeavour. The respondents explained that this is due to limited support from research and academic institutions. In any case, radio researchers find the object of their study to be relevant, influential and well rooted, even if the topics and approaches are permeable to the context where the studies take place."
"Global collaboration continues to grow as a share of all scientific cooperation, measured as coauthorships of peer-reviewed, published papers. The percent of all scientific papers that are internationally coauthored has more than doubled in 20 years, and they account for all the growth in output among the scientifically advanced countries. Emerging countries, particularly China, have increased their participation in global science, in part by doubling their spending on R & D; they are increasingly likely to appear as partners on internationally coauthored scientific papers. Given the growth of connections at the international level, it is helpful to examine the phenomenon as a communications network and to consider the network as a new organization on the world stage that adds to and complements national systems. When examined as interconnections across the globe over two decades, a global network has grown denser but not more clustered, meaning there are many more connections but they are not grouping into exclusive 'cliques'. This suggests that power relationships are not reproducing those of the political system. The network has features an open system, attracting productive scientists to participate in international projects. National governments could gain efficiencies and influence by developing policies and strategies designed to maximize network benefits-a model different from those designed for national systems."
"Background: Models for the production of knowledge and systems of innovation and science are key elements for characterizing a country in view of its scientific thematic profile. With regard to scientific output and publication in journals of international visibility, the countries of the world may be classified into three main groups according to their thematic bias. Methodology/Principal Findings: This paper aims to classify the countries of the world in several broad groups, described in terms of behavioural models that attempt to sum up the characteristics of their systems of knowledge and innovation. We perceive three clusters in our analysis: 1) the biomedical cluster, 2) the basic science & engineering cluster, and 3) the agricultural cluster. The countries are conceptually associated with the clusters via Principal Component Analysis (PCA), and a Multidimensional Scaling (MDS) map with all the countries is presented. Conclusions/Significance: As we have seen, insofar as scientific output and publication in journals of international visibility is concerned, the countries of the world may be classified into three main groups according to their thematic profile. These groups can be described in terms of behavioral models that attempt to sum up the characteristics of their systems of knowledge and innovation."
"As scientists are motivated by readership rather than by royalties, one might doubt that academic copyright is required for stimulating research. Consequently, establishing an open access regime is currently intensively being discussed. We contribute to the literature by using a contest-model in which differently talented researchers compete for limited journals space. The contest perspective adds a rent-seeking motive into the publishing game which questions that private incentives for research are always too low due to the positive externalities of scientific progress. In our model, open access always leads to higher social welfare when incentives are too high. When incentives are too low, then open access is only superior if the benefits from larger readership is sufficiently high."
"This work discusses the advancement of science and the penetration of e-commerce into modern science as well as the openness of publications. We take into account rapidly developing information and communication technologies and the changing infrastructure of science, and this essay focuses attention on the appearance of a new characteristic of the scientific infrastructure and on the benefits it brings to science. We introduce the idea of the e-commercialization of science, and how it supplements the existing scientific infrastructure, its system of incentives, the assessment of the work of scientists, and their remuneration as the authors of ideas and innovations. We also argue that the modernization of the model of interaction among scientists from a market of collaboration to a market of scientific products, technologies, and ideas makes it possible to take advantage of scientific advancement provided by the openness of scientific communication.

"This study analyzes the development of Spanish-Brazilian collaborative scientific production in the field of medical research between 2002 and 2011, identifying the most productive institutions, the proportion of researchers from each country and bi-lateral collaborative networks. Data were gathered from the Scopus database, which offers broad, international coverage of multidisciplinary research. A study sample of 1,121 original scientific articles signed by 13,906 researchers were retrieved, on the basis of which the annual growth rate of Spanish-Brazilian medical research was calculated. A remarkably high degree of internationalization was found, with 121 countries participating in the papers sampled. Moreover, Fully 51 countries in this international network boast at least 15 contributions. The study finds a high degree of collaboration between Spain and Brazil, and significant growth of collaboration in the area of medical research, including collaborations with other countries, with fully 58 % of the sample involving a third country."
"This article discusses the impact of collection sales (i.e., the bundling of several journals for sale by publishers to libraries) on journals. The advent of electronic journal distribution implies that bundling is an efficient sales strategy and can act to extend the reach of a journal. Current arrangements are discussed and shown to lead to tensions between commercial publishers and nonprofit journals. The article argues that nonprofit journals should not necessarily abandon collection sales programs. Rather, nonprofit journals may benefit from withdrawing from commercial publishers which distribute their own for-profit journals, and joining together to be distributed by less commercial publishers who set relatively low prices for their collections. (JEL D82, L31, L42, L82)"
"The causal relation between research and economic growth is of particular importance for political support of science and technology as well as for academic purposes. This article revisits the causal relationship between research articles published and economic growth in Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries for the period 1981-2011, using bootstrap panel causality analysis, which accounts for cross-section dependency and heterogeneity across countries. The article, by the use of the specific method and the choice of the country group, makes a contribution to the existing literature. Our empirical results support unidirectional causality running from research output (in terms of total number of articles published) to economic growth for the US, Finland, Hungary, and Mexico; the opposite causality from economic growth to research articles published for Canada, France, Italy, New Zealand, the UK, Austria, Israel, and Poland; and no causality for the rest of the countries. Our findings provide important policy implications for research policies and strategies for OECD countries."
"Scientific journals may incur scientific error if articles are tainted by research misconduct. While some journals' ethical policies, especially those on conflicts of interest, have improved over recent years, with some adopting a uniform approach, only around half of biomedical journals, principally those with higher impact factors, currently have formal misconduct policies, mainly for handling allegations. Worryingly, since a response to allegations would reasonably require an a priori definition, far fewer journals have publicly available definitions of misconduct. While some journals and editors' associations have taken significant steps to prevent and detect misconduct and respond to allegations, the content, visibility of and access to these policies varies considerably. In addition, while the lack of misconduct policies may prompt and maintain a de novo approach for journals, potentially causing stress, publication delays and even legal disputes, the lack of uniformity may be a matter of contention for research stakeholders such as editors, authors and their institutions, and publishers. Although each case may need an individual approach, I argue that posting highly visible, readily accessible, comprehensive, consistent misconduct policies could prevent the publication of fraudulent papers, increase the number of retractions of already published papers and, perhaps, reduce research misconduct. Although legally problematic, a concerted approach, with sharing of information between editors, which is clearly explained in journal websites, could also help. Ideally, journals, editors' associations, and publishers should seek consistency and homogenise misconduct policies to maintain public confidence in the integrity of biomedical research publications."
"Introduction: In this study, we aimed to give insight into the article review process by investigating the characteristics and the fate of manuscripts submitted to the American Journal of Orthodontics and Dentofacial Orthopedics (AJO-DO). Methods: The following information was obtained for original articles submitted to the AJO-DO in 2008: (1) for rejected articles: the reasons for rejection and the journal of subsequent publication when applicable; (2) for accepted articles: the number of revisions and the time elapsed to publication; and (3) for all articles: study topic, study design, area of origin, and statistically significant findings. Findings were reported using descriptive statistics, the chi-square test for equality of proportions, and multiple regression where appropriate. Post-hoc pair-wise tests were checked against the Bonferroni correction to account for multiple testing. Results: Of the 440 original articles submitted to AJO-DO in 2008, 116 (26%) were accepted and published an average of 21 months (SD, 5 months) after acceptance. Rejected articles totaled 324 (74%), with 137 (42%) finding subsequent publication an average of 22 months (SD, 11 months) after rejection by the AJO-DO. The top 3 reasons for rejection by the AJO-DO were (1) poor study design (59% of rejected articles), (2) outdated or unoriginal topic (42%), and (3) inappropriate for the AJO-DO's audience (27%). Manuscripts rejected for poor study design had the least success for subsequent publication, whereas those rejected as inappropriate for the AJO-DO had the highest rate of publication elsewhere. Area of origin was significantly associated with acceptance by the AJO-DO, with articles from United States and Canada most likely to be accepted (P\ 0.01). Articles from countries with the lowest publication rate in the AJO-DO had the highest publication rate elsewhere. The presence of statistically significant findings was shown to be significantly associated with acceptance by the AJO-DO (P 5 0.013) but not with publication elsewhere (P 5 0.77). Conclusions: Rejection by the AJO-DO does not preclude publication elsewhere, although articles rejected for poor study design were least likely to be eventually published. Many publishable articles are rejected by the AJO-DO as inappropriate for its readership, and these were the most likely to find publication elsewhere. Articles with the highest chance of acceptance by the AJO-DO were those from the United States and Canada and those reporting statistically significant results."
"Assessing the research performance of multi-disciplinary institutions, where scientists belong to many fields, requires that the evaluators plan how to aggregate the performance measures of the various fields. Two methods of aggregation are possible. These are based on: (a) the performance of the individual scientists or (b) the performance of the scientific fields present in the institution. The appropriate choice depends on the evaluation context and the objectives for the particular measure. The two methods bring about differences in both the performance scores and rankings. We quantify these differences through observation of the 2008-2012 scientific production of the entire research staff employed in the hard sciences in Italian universities (over 35,000 professors). Evaluators preparing an exercise must comprehend the differences illustrated, in order to correctly select the methodologies that will achieve the evaluation objectives. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

"As is known, the h-index, h, is an exact function of the citation pattern. At the same time, and more generally, it is recognized that h is ""loosely"" related to the values of some basic statistics, such as the number of publications and the number of citations. In the present study we introduce a formula that expresses the h-index as an almost-exact function of some (four) basic statistics. On the basis of an empirical study-in which we consider citation data obtained from two different lists of journals from two quite different scientific fields-we provide evidence that our ready-to-use formula is able to predict the h-index very accurately (at least for practical purposes). For comparative reasons, alternative estimators of the h-index have been considered and their performance evaluated by drawing on the same dataset. We conclude that, in addition to its own interest, as an effective proxy representation of the h-index, the formula introduced may provide new insights into ""factors"" determining the value of the h-index, and how they interact with each other."
"The Mexican National Research System (Sistema Nacional de Investigadores, SNI) is now 30 years old. By now the SNI has assumed other roles besides providing a salary complement. It has influenced ethical values and it has been a factor in the development and the productivity of the research activity in the country. In this paper, we use the statistics and information provided by the SNI to analyze the current situation of physics in Mexico (its group conformation, and the contents of the research. We then characterize it by listing the different subjects of research). The graduation institutions, the current place of work, gender, age ranges and the SNI level attained. One of the contributions of this work is the development of parameters indicating the degree of mobility and of academic inbreeding as registered in the SNI documentation. We find an important contribution of this group of researchers to the process of decentralization of the Mexican scientific activity."
"Methodi Ordinatio is a methodology used to accomplish systematic literature reviews, to build bibliographical portfolios, and to map the state of the art of a research theme. It is composed of nine phases. The 7th phase, named InOrdinatio, applies an equation that orders the papers according to its scientific relevance. The equation applies the alpha (alpha) element, which can vary from 0 to 10 depending on the research need of currentness and according to the researcher's perception for its variation. Therefore, the aim of this paper is to test and analyse the variations of the alpha (alpha) values in the equation InOrdinatio and its influence in the qualification of the items that composes a portfolio. In order to reach this purpose, a practical application was performed and a bibliographic portfolio on the theme Horizontal Business Networks and Trust was built. Using the data from the bibliographic portfolio, the alpha values from 0 to 10 were applied and their influence on the final qualification of the articles was analysed. As a complementary objective, the areas where the methodology was successfully applied until now are also identified. The results show that the methodology is coherent, reproducible and useful to sort the most relevant articles in accordance with what is internationally recognized as valid scientific criteria: the impact factor, year of publication, and number of citations."
"This study analyzed whether research collaboration patterns differ across higher education systems based on maturity of the systems, their language, and their geographical region. This study found that collaboration patterns differ across higher education systems: academics in developed systems are more collaborative than their colleagues in developing systems; academics in English-speaking countries are no more collaborative than their colleagues in non-English speaking countries; and academics in European countries are more collaborative internationally than their colleagues in non-European countries. In addition, it was found that publication is not associated with collaboration, either domestically or internationally. This finding implies that collaboration is a different dimension from publication. Finally, the article discusses implications of the findings for evaluation systems."
"We are talking about the most beautiful woman in the world, about the largest cave in Europe, about the best sportsman of a particular year. We have even started to rank companies according to their ""intellectual assets"", universities according to their ""importance"", and scientists according to their ""impact"". It is time that we protest against this culture of ""linearity"" in a world that is multi-faceted, where many things cannot be described by one parameter, but only (if at all) by a very long vector of parameters. In this paper, I investigate this phenomenon to some extent as it applies to (computer) scientists and also indicate a link to the information avalanche we are confronted with. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

"This study examines changes over time in patterns of collaboration for the top 100 research institutions. Compared with a set of less high-impact institutions (ranked 401-500), the top institutions have more rapidly increased the proportion of their research that is collaborative. Moreover, they collaborate increasingly outside of the top 100 institutions, even though they cite increasingly inside of the top 100. This suggests that members of elite institutions are prepared to collaborate widely even if they prefer to rely upon a narrower set of high-quality research."
"The International Committee of Medical Journal Editors is a leading independent institution providing guidance for the report of biomedical research and health related topics in medical journals. Established in 1978, it is currently constituted by editors of fourteen general medical journals from different countries, plus one representative for the US National Library of Medicine and one representative for the World Association of Biomedical Journal Editors. Since 1978 the Committee provides a document, originally named ""Uniform Requirements..."", ""to help authors, editors, and others involved in peer review and biomedical publishing create and distribute accurate, clear, unbiased medical journal articles"". This document has been updated several times and the last version was released in August 2013, now renamed ""Recommendations for the Conduct, Reporting, Editing, and Publication of Scholarly Work in Medical Journals"", available in www.icmje.org and citable as ""ICMJE Recommendations': A vast proportion of medical journals, worldwide, have adopted these recommendations as rules. The ICMJE discusses and provides guidance on several relevant aspects including criteria on authorship, peer review, scientific misconduct, conflicts of interest, clinical trials registration, good editorial practices, the relations between editors and journal owners, the protection of individuals subject to medical research, the solvency of electronic publications, among others. The 2013 ICMJE Annual Meeting took place in Santiago, Chile, in November 4 and 5. The photograph shows attendants to the final session."
"The objective of this paper is to provide a detailed evaluation of type 2 diabetes mellitus research output from 1951-2012, using large-scale data analysis, bibliometric indicators and density-equalizing mapping. Data were retrieved from the Science Citation Index Expanded database, one of the seven curated databases within Web of Science. Using Boolean operators ""OR"", ""AND"" and ""NOT"", a search strategy was developed to estimate the total number of published items. Only studies with an English abstract were eligible. Type 1 diabetes and gestational diabetes items were excluded. Specific software developed for the database analysed the data. Information including titles, authors' affiliations and publication years were extracted from all files and exported to excel. Density-equalizing mapping was conducted as described by Groenberg-Kloft et al, 2008. A total of 24,783 items were published and cited 476,002 times. The greatest number of outputs were published in 2010 (n=2,139). The United States contributed 28.8% to the overall output, followed by the United Kingdom (8.2%) and Japan (7.7%). Bilateral cooperation was most common between the United States and United Kingdom (n=237). Harvard University produced 2% of all publications, followed by the University of California (1.1%). The leading journals were Diabetes, Diabetologia and Diabetes Care and they contributed 9.3%, 7.3% and 4.0% of the research yield, respectively. In conclusion, the volume of research is rising in parallel with the increasing global burden of disease due to type 2 diabetes mellitus. Bibliometrics analysis provides useful information to scientists and funding agencies involved in the development and implementation of research strategies to address global health issues."
"The aim of this study is to show the current landscape of the visibility and popularity of scientific journals in psychology published in Latin American countries, according to a recent Journal Citation Reports (JCR) 2010. This is a descriptive study using analysis of documents. We analyzed a total of 18 journals, of which 61.11 % (11) are Spanish, 33.33 % (6) are Latin American and 5.55 % (1) Portuguese, 50 % are indexed in the category of ""Psychology, Multidisciplinary ""and the Latin American magazine with the Impact Factor (IF) 2010 Universitas Psychologica is higher (1,283), followed by Psicologia: Reflexao e Critica (1,124). Contradictorily. Latin American journal that has obtained the highest indexed IF fits the category of ""Psychology, Clinical"" and it is about International Journal of Clinical and Health Psychology (1,842)."
"This study proposes a new framework for citation content analysis (CCA), for syntactic and semantic analysis of citation content that can be used to better analyze the rich sociocultural context of research behavior. This framework could be considered the next generation of citation analysis. The authors briefly review the history and features of content analysis in traditional social sciences and its previous application in library and information science (LIS). Based on critical discussion of the theoretical necessity of a new method as well as the limits of citation analysis, the nature and purposes of CCA are discussed, and potential procedures to conduct CCA, including principles to identify the reference scope, a two-dimensional (citing and cited) and two-module (syntactic and semantic) codebook, are provided and described. Future work and implications are also suggested."
"During four decades of economic reforms, research universities have become China's new national symbol of intellectual prowess. The government has been strategizing and pouring in resources to strengthen their global competitiveness. Despite expanded opportunities, universities have continued to operate within the confines of a tight regulatory regime. Based on interviews with university leaders and executives, this article focuses on China's first-of-its-kind university advocacy coalition known as C9 and investigates how the leading Chinese research universities align their interests and act collectively vis-a-vis the central state to influence policies of crucial importance to their operations. It sheds light on how collective lobbying works in the university sector and on its limitations in the Chinese political context and examines the key factors that shape the interactions among universities, the outcomes of collective lobbying, and the political implications."
"The debate over the value of the International Space Station has overlooked a fundamental question: What is the station's contribution to scientific knowledge? We address this question using a multivariate analysis of publication and patent data from station experiments. We find a relatively high probability that ISS experiments with PIs drawn from outside NASA will yield refereed publications and, furthermore, that these experiments have nonnegligible probabilities of finding publication in high-impact journals or producing government patents. However, technology demonstrations and experiments with all-NASA PIs have much weaker track records. These results highlight the complexities inherent to constructing a compelling case for science onboard the ISS or for crewed spaceflight in general."
"The interests in journal impact factor (JIF) in scientific communities have grown over the last decades. The JIFs are used to evaluate journals quality and the papers published therein. JIF is a discipline specific measure and the comparison between the JIF dedicated to different disciplines is inadequate, unless a normalization process is performed. In this study, normalized impact factor (NIF) was introduced as a relatively simple method enabling the JIFs to be used when evaluating the quality of journals and research works in different disciplines. The NIF index was established based on the multiplication of JIF by a constant factor. The constants were calculated for all 54 disciplines of biomedical field during 2005, 2006, 2007, 2008 and 2009 years. Also, ranking of 393 journals in different biomedical disciplines according to the NIF and JIF were compared to illustrate how the NIF index can be used for the evaluation of publications in different disciplines. The findings prove that the use of the NIF enhances the equality in assessing the quality of research works produced by researchers who work in different disciplines. (c) 2010 Elsevier Inc.

"This paper ranks the economic research institutions in China based on publications in the SSCI economics journals from 2000 through 2009 and finds that the gap in the research capacity of economic research institutions between the mainland and Hong Kong is very large, even though the difference in overall quality is not so significant. This paper can reflect successes and failures of the reform of the economics education in China over the past decade and give important implications for the ongoing reforms as well.

"To illuminate barriers to collaboration, this study examines who participates in cross-boundary scholarly collaboration most often and which types of boundary crossing (disciplinary, institutional, role) are engaged in most often. The data of this study came from an interdisciplinary consortium with five partner institutions, including one Historically Black College and University (HBCU). The core disciplines involved in the consortium are life sciences, computer science and math and engineering. Through statistical analysis, we determined that members of the consortium engaged more in interdisciplinary research than inter-institutional research. Participation in all boundary crossing collaborations was greater at the HBCU and students and postdocs were less likely than academics to cross-institutional boundaries."
"In general, scientometrics studies tend to focus on citations received from journals (incoming citations) and usually neglect references to journals (outgoing citations). The aim of this study is to suggest a new approach to the journal impact factor on a wider scale, i.e., from the viewpoint of citing journals. I studied how citations (references) given by JCR journals contribute to the 2-year and 5-year journal impact factors (JIF). To do so, data were obtained from the 2011 edition of JCR (Science Edition) available for universities in Spain, and the citing journal matrix for each journal was used. This matrix records the number of times articles published in other journals (cited journals) were cited in a given journal (citing journal) in 2011. The results showed that a set of 50 journals produced about 15% of all references that contributed to the 2-year JIF. Similarly, a set of 50 journals produced about 13% of all references that contributed to the 5-year JIF. A Bradford-like plot was obtained by plotting the cumulative number of references that contributed to the 2-year and 5-year JIF against the cumulative number of citing journals. The distribution of journals according to the number and percentage of references they contributed to the 2-year and 5-year JIF showed peaks. A rank-order distribution of references that contributed to the 2-year and 5 year JIF was obtained with a previously described empirical two-exponent equation. Based on the maximum contribution to the 2-year JIF of different 2-year rolling reference windows, the second rolling window (references to articles published 2 and 3 years before 2011) made the greatest contribution to impact in 41% of journals.

"Traditional bibliometric indicators are considered too limited for some research areas such as humanities and social sciences because they mostly reveal a specific aspect of academic performance (quantity of publications) and tend to ignore a significant part of research production. The frequent misuses (e.g. improper generalizations) of bibliometric measures results in a substantial part of the research community failing to consider the exact nature of bibliometric measures. This study investigates the links between practices for assessing academic performance, bibliometric methods' use and underlying values of research quality within the scientific community of University of Lausanne, Switzerland. Findings reveal four researcher profiles depending on research orientations and goals, ranging from those using ""pure"" quantitative tools to those using more subjective and personal techniques. Each profile is characterized according to disciplinary affiliation, tenure, academic function as well as commitment to quality values."
"The present article addresses the differences in research productivity and impact between Chinese scholars in China and overseas. A total of 1190 Chinese scholars in China and 1983 Chinese scholars overseas were recognized out of 6306 papers in six journals over 10 years. Research performance was evaluated by informetric indicators, including the absolute value, proportion, and average number of authors, publications, citations, and usage counts. Statistics metrics, including standard deviation and coefficient of variance, were used to test the viability of two groups. These metrics conclude that: (1) in general, Chinese scholars in China have fewer advantages than Chinese scholars overseas on all indicators; (2) Chinese scholars in China have more research potentiality than other scholars due to the faster speed of metrics' growth; and (3) Chinese scientific research in China is more developed and better at science than social science. Additionally, Chinese scholars in China have a slightly stronger impact in most research areas than Chinese scholars overseas."
"Purpose: There is a lack of data concerning the evaluation of scientific research productivity in paracetamol poisoning from the world. The purposes of this study were to analyse the worldwide research output related to paracetamol poisoning and to examine the authorship pattern and the citations retrieved from the Scopus database for over a decade. Methods: Data were searched for documents with specific words regarding paracetamol poisoning as keywords' in the title or/and abstract. Scientific output was evaluated based on a methodology developed and used in other bibliometric studies. Research productivity was adjusted to the national population and nominal gross domestic product (GDP) per capita. Results: There were 1721 publications that met the criteria during study period from the world. All retrieved documents were published from 72 countries. The largest number of articles related to paracetamol poisoning was from the United States (US; 30.39%), followed by India (10.75%) and the United Kingdom (UK; 9.36%). The total number of citations at the time of data analysis was 21,109, with an average of 12.3 citations per each documents and median (interquartile range) of 4 (1-14). The h-index of the retrieved documents was 57. After adjusting for economy and population power, India (124.2), Nigeria (18.6) and the US (10.5) had the highest research productivity. Countries with large economies, such as the UK, Australia, Japan, China and France, tended to rank relatively low after adjustment for GDP over the entire study period. Conclusion: Our study demonstrates evidence that research productivity related to paracetamol poisoning has increased rapidly during the recent years. The US obviously dominated in research productivity. However, certain smaller country such as Nigeria has high scientific output relative to their population size and GDP. A highly noticeable increase in the contributions of Asia-Pacific and Middle East regions to scientific literature related to paracetamol poisoning was also observed."
"In this article, I review, comment upon, and assess some of the suggestions for evaluating scientific merit as suggested by contributors to this symposium. I ask the reader to take the perspective of the individual who has the final say in making a tenure, promotion, or hiring decision. I also ask that one imagine the difference between the fallible human state we are in on such an occasion and what it would be like to be omniscient when making such decisions. After adopting the terminology of deep and surface eminence, I consider what an omniscient being would take into account to determine eminence and to guide decision-making. After discussing how some proposed improvements in assessing merit might move us closer to wise decisions, I conclude by noting that both data and judgment are, and will continue to be, necessary. A clerk cannot determine eminence."
"This paper examines the Web visibility of researchers in the field of communication. First, we measured the Web visibility of authors who have recently published their research in communication journals contained in the Social Science Citation Index (SSCI) provided by the Web of Science. Second, we identified a subset of authors based on their publication outlets and summarize those researchers with the highest Web presence. Lastly, we determined the factors affecting their Web visibility by using a set of national and linguistic variables of the individual researchers. Web data were collected by using a Bing.com advanced search tool based on the API. Web presence is defined as the number of Web (co-) mentions of each researcher. We identified the most solely-visible scholars in the entire communication webosphere and scholars with the most networked visibility based on co-mentions. There is a weak but statistically significant correlation between researchers' Web visibility and their SSCI publication counts. Further, US-based and/or English-speaking scholars were more noticeable than others on cyberspace."
"I discuss the critical importance of putting culture in the middle in judging scholarly merit in psychological science. I describe the challenges in evaluating cultural research, pointing out the various ways that ethnocentric judgments undermine the scientific merit of cultural research and the consequences of the marginalization of culture in psychological science and practice. In spite of the obstacles, cultural psychologists have made major scientific contributions and achieved scientific eminence. I further suggest that we raise the bar by including a broad, cultural approach to research as one basis for judging scientific contributions. I propose that to put culture in the middle, the evaluation of scholarly merit in psychological science should (a) consider the integration of cultural perspectives in research as a critical indicator, (b) take into consideration the international visibility of scholarship, (c) benefit from a general consensus among cultural researchers, (d) document real-life impact in different populations, and (e) be mindful of the beliefs and practices of scientific communities in other cultures."
"The open access (OA) movement today incorporates a number of different threads reflecting disagreement among information professionals, publishers, institutions and advocates about how OA is defined and facilitated. It is unclear in this environment how faculty members involved in teaching and research construct understanding about open access and what range of understandings among this constituency may currently exist. This paper reports the results of a study using phenomenography to understand the open access experiences and perceptions of faculty members who teach online; a growing subgroup of faculty whose professional context positions themselves and their students differently in relation to subscription-based digital and print-based library collections and support than in a brick-and-mortar educational environment. Faculty members in this group experienced open access in five qualitatively distinctive ways: as resources for teaching as a publication channel; as a social justice movement"", as open source, and as 'free for me'. These findings have implications for outreach and communication efforts for university libraries and higher education administrators, and offer in-sights into the concerns and challenges faced by faculty members while engaging with open access materials."
"This paper presents a simple parametric statistical approach to comparing different citation-based journal ranking metrics within a single academic field. The mechanism can also be used to compare the same metric across different academic fields. The mechanism operates by selecting an optimal normalization factor and an optimal distributional adjustment for the rank-score curve, both of which are instrumental in making sound intermetric and interfield journal comparisons."
"Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to present a bibliometric analysis of scientific output of the knowledge management (KM), the aim being to offer an overview of research activity in this field and characterize its most significant aspects. In addition, this study aims to quantitatively analyze KM research trends, forecasts, and citations from 1993 to 2012 in Web of Science (WOS). Design/methodology/approach - A total of 12,925 documents related to KM research were collected from following databases: Science Citation Index Expanded, Social Sciences Citation Index, Arts & Humanities Citation Index, Conference Proceedings Citation Index-Science, and Conference Proceedings Citation Index-Social Science & Humanities. These documents were carefully reviewed and subjected to bibliometric data analysis techniques. Findings - A number of research questions pertaining to patterns in scientific outputs, subject categories and major journals, author keywords frequencies, characteristics of the international collaboration, most cited papers and significant papers distribution of KM research were proposed and answered. In addition, there are five research sights on KM research are as follows: management science, computer science, information science, business, and engineering. Based on these findings, many implications emerged that improve one's understanding of the identity of KM as a distinct multi-discipline scientific field. Research limitations/implications - Comprehensiveness and inclusiveness of the analyzed KM-related data set in WOS because of some KM-centric journals are not indexed by Thomson Reuters. Originality/value - The paper offers an overview and evaluation of research activity into the KM viewed through the WOS during 1993-2012."
"Patent activity in China for vibration-reduction control technology in high-speed railway vehicle systems was analyzed based on a portfolio of 193 patents or applications from the State Intellectual Property Office of the People's Republic of China official Web-based database and a search of the World Intellectual Property Organization PCT database. Patent activity features such as timing, applicant, technology classification, technical themes, and patents in force were obtained and analyzed. As a further stage of research, patent data on locomotive wheel sets were analyzed by means of a matrix analysis of problems and technologies. The main statistical information and conclusions include estimating the development stage, discovering the distributions of applications and applicants, weighing the roles played by major applications, determining R&D hotspots, and providing a better understanding of domestic patent activities in this field. Policy implications for innovation-related domestic R&D institutions in the technologies under study were proposed based on the analytical results."
"The paper describes a method to combine the information on the number of citations and the relevance of the publishing journal (as measured by the Impact Factor or similar impact indicators) of a publication to rank it with respect to the world scientific production in the specific subfield. The linear or non-linear combination of the two indicators is represented on the scatter plot of the papers in the specific subfield in order to immediately visualize the effect of a change in weights. The final rank of the papers is therefore obtained by partitioning the two-dimensional space through linear or higher order curves. The procedure is intuitive and versatile since it allows, after adjusting few parameters, an automatic and calibrated assessment at the level of the subfield. The derived evaluation is homogeneous among different scientific domains and can be used to address the quality of research at the departmental (or higher) levels of aggregation. We apply this method, that is designed to be feasible on a scale typical of a national evaluation exercise and to be effective in terms of cost and time, to some instances of the Thomson Reuters Web of Science database and discuss the results in view of what was done recently in Italy for the Evaluation of Research Quality exercise 2004-2010. We show how the main limitations of the bibliometric methodology used in that context can be easily overcome."
"Research on research integrity is an important element in building a strong national research integrity framework. There is a lack of empirical evidence and conceptual research on research integrity in Canada. To further strengthen and develop our system of research integrity, we believe that greater support is needed to promote research on research integrity. Research on research integrity is imperative in order to gain a richer understanding of the diversity of responsible conduct of research norms, practices, education and policies from a Canadian perspective. The knowledge gained would help in the development of an evidenced-based and responsive Canadian system of research integrity."
"Information security has been a crucial issue in modern information management; thus cryptographic techniques have become inevitable to safeguard the digital information assets as well as to defend the invasion of privacy in modern information society, and likely to have far reaching impact on national security policies. This paper demonstrates the intellectual development of cryptographic research based on quantifiable characteristics of scholarly publications over a decade of the present century (2001 to 2010). The study critically examines the publication growth, authorship pattern, collaboration trends, and predominant areas of research in cryptology. Rank list of prolific contributors, productive institutions, and predominant countries have been carried out using fractional counting method. Strenuous efforts have been made to perform the activity index (performance indicator) of JOC, to determine the degree of collaboration in quantitative terms, to ascertain the collaboration density, as well as to test the empirical validation of Lotka's law in this scientific specialty. Major findings reveal that performance of JOC in cryptographic research corresponds precisely to the growth of world's publication activity (activity index = 1.1) over a decade of time; single-authored papers count only 25 % and average authorship accounts for 2.4 per paper; an increasing trend of multi-authored publications and a significant degree of collaboration (DC = 0.74) implies that cryptographers prefer to work in highly collaborative manner; author productivity distribution data partially fits the Lotka's law, when the value of alpha (productivity parameter) approximated to 2.35 (instead of 2) and the number of articles does not exceed two. While large majority of collaborations constituted across the countries (56 %), then adequate amount of inter-country bilateral and multilateral collaboration signifies higher density or greater strength in the research network; most of the potential collaborators are emanated from 10 institutions of 5 different countries; however, cryptographic research is dominated by USA and Israel. More interestingly, vast majority among top-twenty ranked productive authors are affiliated in USA and Israel; Yehuda Lindell is found to be the most prolific author followed by Rosario Gennaro (USA), Tamir Tassa (Israel), Jonathan Katz (USA), etc.; Anglo-American institutions are more open than their overseas competitors; University of California (six centers) is placed on the top of the productive institutions. The study entails distinct subject clusters (research streams); and author-assigned keyword frequencies revealed that cryptanalysis, discrete logarithm, elliptic curve, block cipher, provable security, cryptography, secure computation, oblivious transfer, public-key encryption, zero-knowledge are more prevalent and active topics of research in cryptology. The implications of empirical results to the field are discussed thoroughly, and further analyzes are proposed to visualize this assessment in a better way."
"Bibliometry is a quantitative statistical technique to measure levels of production and dissemination of knowledge, as well as a useful tool to track the development of an scientific area. The valuation of production required for recognition of researchers and magazines is accomplished through tools called bibliometricindexes, divided into quality indicators and scientific impact. Initially developed for monographs of statistical measures especially in libraries, today bibliometrics is mainly used to evaluate productivity of authors and citation repercussion. However, these tools have limitations and sometimes provoke controversies about indiscriminate application, leading to the development of newer indexes. It is important to know the most common search indexes and use it properly even acknowledging its limitations as it has a direct impact in their daily practice, reputation and funds achievement."
"Whether singleton approach (citation analysis of identified source journals) used by Gross and Gross (Science 66(1713):385-389, 1927) or differential approach (citation analysis of articles in specific subject field) applied by Bradford (Engineering 137:85-86, 1934) suitable to select or rank journals in multifaceted subject-'Oceanography' is presented. This study discusses both the approaches analyzing citations of published literature in oceanography from 30 countries. The ranking correlation of journals showed better positive correlation (lowest rho = 0.662 for 2005-2009 to highest rho = 0.817 for 1995-1999) when top ranked journals from the list generated complying Gross and Gross approach (GA) were correlated with same journal titles of the list generated complying Bradford approach than the other way (lowest rho = 0.588 for 2005-2009 to highest rho = 0.726 for 1990-1994). Both the approaches matched similar number of journals to country-wise lists and give unbiased choice in preferring a ranking list. The journals distribution graphs showed typical Bradford-Leimkuhler curves in both the approaches for all the datasets. But the groos droop appears comparatively early with shorter straight line in GA. The high clustering of literature to limited number of journals is a disadvantage in multifaceted subject. So the differential approach used by Bradford is being considered suitable for multifaceted subject like, 'Oceanography'."
"In this paper, we analyzed data relating to the language of papers written by winners of Nobel Prizes in physics before they won the prize and their journals of publication, and we identified the change in scientific language corresponding with shifts of the center of the scientific world. Using the science citation index as the main data source, we also collected information on the distribution of prize-winning scientists by country, by each scientist's number of published papers, and by language. We then analyzed their papers in terms of the different journals based in different countries. The results are presented in three parts: (1) the main languages used in the papers are English and German. The proportion of papers in English is gradually increasing, while that of papers in German is decreasing. (2) The prize winning scientists' papers have been published mainly in journals in their own nation and in the United States. (3) Journals based in their own countries are very helpful to these scientists early in their careers."
"Background: Governance is one of the main functions of Health Research System (HRS) that consist of four essential elements such as setting up evaluation system. The goal of this study was to introduce a new web based research evaluation model in Iran. Methods: Based on main elements of governance, research indicators have been clarified and with cooperation of technical team, appropriate software was designed. Three main steps in this study consist of developing of mission-oriented program, creating enabling environment and set up Iran Research Medical Portal as a center for research evaluation. Results: Fifty-two universities of medical sciences in three types have been participated. After training the evaluation focal points in all of medical universities, access to data entry and uploading all of documents were provided. Regarding to mission - based program, the contribution of medical universities in knowledge production was 60% for type one, 31% for type two and 9% for type three. The research priorities based on Essential National Health Research (ENHR) approach and mosaic model were gathered from universities of medical sciences and aggregated to nine main areas as national health research priorities. Ethical committees were established in all of medical universities. Conclusion: Web based research evaluation model is a comprehensive and integrated system for data collection in research. This system is appropriate tool to national health research ranking."
"This study on research collaboration (RC) is an attempt to estimate the degree of internationalization of academic institutions and regions. Furthermore potential influences of RC on excellence initiatives of modern universities are investigated relying on source data obtained from SCImago Institutions Rankings. A positive correlation exists between the degree of collaboration and the normalized impact. However, in contrast to output the normalized impact increase progression is non-linear and fluctuating. Differences occur regarding output volume and normalized impact at geographical region level for the leading universities. Different patterns of the Brute force distribution for each collaboration type were also observed at region level as well as at subject area level. A continuously reduced percentage of the domestic (non-collaboration) academic output is a world trend, whereas a steady increase of ""international + national"" collaboration is observed globally, however, less distinctive in Asia than in the other regions. The impact of Latin American papers originating from domestic production as well as from national collaboration remains considerably below world average values."
"Background: Attitudes towards authorship are connected with authors' research experience and with knowledge of authorship criteria of International Committee of Medical Journal Editors (ICMJE). The objective of this study was to assess association between authors' perceived importance of contributions for authorship qualification and their participation in manuscripts submitted to a journal. Methods: Authors (n=1181) of 265 manuscripts submitted to the Croatian Medical Journal were asked to identify and rate their contribution in the preparation of the submitted manuscript (0 - none to 4 - full for 11 listed contributions) and the importance of these contributions as authorship qualifications (0 - none to 4-full). They were randomly allocated into 3 groups: the first (n=90 manuscripts, n=404 authors) first received the contribution disclosure form and then contribution importance-rating questionnaire; the second (n=88 manuscripts, n=382 authors) first received the rating questionnaire and then the contribution disclosure form, and the third group (n=87 manuscripts, n=395 authors) received both questionnaires at the same time. We compared authors' perception of importance of contribution categories. Results: 1014 (85.9%) authors of 235 manuscripts responded. Authors who declared contribution to a specific category rated it as more important for authorship than those authors who did not contribute to the same category (P>0.005 for all contribution categories, Mann-Withney test). Authors qualifying for ICMJE authorship rated all contribution categories higher than non-qualifying authors. For all contributions, associations between perceived importance of contribution and actual author's contribution were statistically significant. Conclusions: Authorship seems to be not a normative issue subjective to categorization into criteria, but also a very personal view of the importance and value of one's contributions."
"In this study, reference standards and reference multipliers are suggested as a means to compare the citation impact of earlier research publications in physics (from the period of ""Little Science"" in the early 20th century) with that of contemporary papers (from the period of ""Big Science,"" beginning around 1960). For the development of time-specific reference standards, the authors determined (a) the mean citation rates of papers in selected physics journals as well as (b) the mean citation rates of all papers in physics published in 1900 (Little Science) and in 2000 (Big Science); this was accomplished by relying on the processes of field-specific standardization in bibliometry. For the sake of developing reference multipliers with which the citation impact of earlier papers can be adjusted to the citation impact of contemporary papers, they combined the reference standards calculated for 1900 and 2000 into their ratio. The use of reference multipliers is demonstrated by means of two examples involving the time adjusted h index values for Max Planck and Albert Einstein."
"Better understanding of research and publishing misconduct can improve strategies to mitigate their occurrence. In this study, we examine various trends among 2,375 articles retracted due to misconduct in all scholarly fields. Proportions of articles retracted due to ""publication misconduct"" (primarily plagiarism and duplicate publication) or ""distrust data or interpretations"" (primarily research artifacts and unexplained irreproducibility of data) differ significantly between PubMed (35 and 59 %, respectively) and non-PubMed (56 and 27 %) articles and between English- and non-English-speaking author affiliation countries. Retraction rates due to any form of misconduct, adjusted for the size of the literature in different disciplines, vary from 0.22 per 100,000 articles in the Humanities to 7.58 in Medicine and 7.69 in Chemistry. The annual rate of article retractions due to misconduct has increased exponentially since 2001, and the percentage of all retractions involving misconduct allegations has grown from 18.5-29.2 % for each year from 1990-1993 to 55.8-71.9 % for each year from 2007-2010. Despite these increases, the prominence of research integrity in the news media has not changed appreciably over the past 20 years. Articles retracted due to misconduct are found in all major scholarly disciplines. The higher rate of plagiarism among authors from non-English speaking countries may diminish if institutions improved their support for the writing of English manuscripts by their scholars. The training of junior scholars on proper codes of research (and publishing) conduct should be embraced by all disciplines, not just by biomedical fields where the perception of misconduct is high."
"The three important research domains, nanotechnology, biotechnology and pharmaceuticals, integratedly breed a promising multidisciplinary domain in the post-genomic age, which was recently defined by the term ""nanobiopharmaceuticals"". In this paper, we firstly investigate its general development profiles, and then implement cross-country comparisons in its research performances, with the focus on the world share, relative research effort, impact and quality of five productive countries. Furthermore, from the science mapping perspective, we build the co-word and co-citation networks respectively for detecting its intellectual structure as well as evolution footprints of intellectual turning points. The growth examinations based on the datasets from WoS, MEDLINE and BIOSIS Review confirm the exponential growth of publications and citations in nanobiopharm-research. The cross-country comparisons show that USA is the leading country, and China is an up-and-coming contributor. The visual mapping structures by co-occurrence analyses show that nanobiopharm-research is currently focused on the drug development for improving biodistribution, bioavailability and pharmacokinetics, and the drug delivery for improving delivery of existing drugs. Some pivot publications is identified by CiteSpace, which work as structural holes, research fronts and intellectual bases for the nanobiopharm-research development in the given time window.

"We examine the relative strength of short-term citation counts, bibliometric measures such as journal impact factors, and journal rankings in terms of predicting long-run citations. Using a set of articles published in sixty of the highest reputation economics journals in 1994, we find that citations received over fairly short windows (between 1 and 2 years after publication) are much stronger predictors of long-run citation counts compared with journal impact factors or other journal rankings. Our results are robust to a series of robustness checks. These findings suggest department heads and tenure and promotion committees should place greater weight on short-term citations as opposed to article placement when making personnel decisions."
"Although peer review is crucial for innovation and experimental discoveries in science, it is poorly understood in scientific terms. Discovering its true dynamics and exploring adjustments which improve the commitment of everyone involved could benefit scientific development for all disciplines and consequently increase innovation in the economy and the society. We have reported the results of an innovative experiment developed to model peer review. We demonstrate that offering material rewards to referees tends to decrease the quality and efficiency of the reviewing process. Our findings help to discuss the viability of different options of incentive provision, supporting the idea that journal editors and responsible of research funding agencies should be extremely careful in offering material incentives on reviewing, since these might undermine moral motives which guide referees' behavior.

"Introduction: Despite years of relative neglect, interest in Giardia infection seems to be recently growing, perhaps in part due to its inclusion into the World Health Organization's Neglected Diseases Initiative since 2004. The purpose of this study was to provide an overview of Giardia and giardiasis research over time, as represented by the quantity of published papers. Methodology: Data for this study were collected from the electronic PubMed/Medline database of National Library of Medicine's (NLM), due to it is easily accessibility and wide use. It was accessed online between April and December 2011. Data for the period 1971-2010 were obtained and information was downloaded using the EndNote program developed by Thomson Reuters. Results: During the study period, a total of 6,964 references (articles, reviews, editorials, letter to the editor, etc.) covering different aspects of Giardia and giardiasis were located in the PubMed database after applying the search strategy reported above. Most papers were original articles and published in English. Conclusions: In this first effort to explore the development and research productivity on giardiasis over time (no previously published bibliometric studies on giardiasis exist), two interesting characteristics of the Giardia and giardiasis literature were discovered: the concentration of papers over journals disseminating the research results, and that research in this field is growing and will likely continue to grow in the coming years."
"BackgroundThe BEEM (best evidence in emergency medicine) rater scale was created for emergency physicians (EPs) to evaluate the physician-derived clinical relevance score of recently published, emergency medicine (EM)-related studies. BEEM therefore is designed to help make EPs aware of studies most likely to confirm or change current clinical practice. ObjectivesThe objective was to validate the BEEM rater score as a predictor of literature citation, using a bibliometric construct of clinical relevance to EM based on author-, document-, and journal-level measures (first and last author h-indices, number of authors including corporate and group authors, citations from date of publication to 2011, and journal impact factor scores) and study characteristics (design, category, and sample size). MethodsEach month from 2007 through 2012, approximately 200 EPs from around the world voluntarily reviewed the titles and conclusions of recently published EM-related studies identified by BEEM faculty via the McMaster Health Information Research Unit. Using the BEEM rater scale, a reliable seven-item instrument that evaluates the clinical relevance of studies, raters independently assigned BEEM scores to approximately 10 to 20 articles each month. Two investigators independently abstracted the bibliometric indices for these articles. A citation rate for each article was calculated by dividing the Thomson Reuters Web of Science (WoS) total citation count by the number ofyears in publication. BEEM rater scores were correlated with the citation rate using Spearman's rho. The performance of the BEEM rater score was assessed for each article using negative binomial regression with composite citation count as the criterion standard, while controlling for other independent bibliometric variables in three models. ResultsThe BEEM raters evaluated 605 articles with a mean (SD) BEEM score of 3.84 (0.7) and a median BEEM score of 3.85 (interquartile range= 3.38 to 4.30). Articles were primarily therapeutic (59%) and diagnostic (27%), with various designs, including 37% systematic reviews, 32% randomized controlled trials (RCTs), and 30% observational designs. The citation rate and BEEM rater score correlated positively (0.144), while the BEEM rater score and the Journal Citation Report (JCR) impact factor score were minimally correlated (0.053). In the first model, the BEEM rater score significantly predicted WoS citation rate (p<0.0001) with an odds ratio (OR) of 1.24 (95% confidence interval [CI]=1.106 to 1.402). In subsequent models adjusting for the JCR impact factor score, the h-indices of the first and last authors, number of authors, and study design, the BEEM rater score was not significant (p=0.08). ConclusionsTo the best of our knowledge, the BEEM rater score is the only known measure of clinical relevance. It has a high interrater reliability and face validity and correlates with future citations. Future research should assess this instrument against alternative constructs of clinical relevance."
"In the last five decades, a great deal has been written about the serials crisis,' library budget shortfalls, the growth of various commercial scholarly publishers, the response from various academic library associations to the serials crisis, and the emergence of open access publications. Yet very little has been written about the economics of scholarly publishing. In this article, the growth of universities and the academic community's never-ending need for prestigious scholarly publications are explored, along with substantive economic theories used by scholarly publishers, including portfolio theory, product differentiation, economic rent, and perfect price discrimination. A series of recommendations are made to ameliorate the clash' between academia and the scholarly publishing community."
"Recent debates around the digital law, as well as discussions following the introduction of an open access policy by the European Research Council were instrumental in publicizing the international debates on the transformation of the political economy of scientific publications in France. Without discussing here the vast literature produced by researchers in library science, but also by various stakeholders (open access activists, publishers, learned societies, fenders, political bodies), we remind the characteristics of HSS academic publishing, then describe contemporary forms of appropriation of scientific publications by publishers and platforms. Finally, we describe various public policies and the foundations of the InSHS policy in this area."
"We study the problem of normalizing citation impact indicators for differences in citation practices across scientific fields. Normalization of citation impact indicators is usually done based on a field classification system. In practice, the Web of Science journal subject categories are often used for this purpose. However, many of these subject categories have a quite broad scope and are not sufficiently homogeneous in terms of citation practices. As an alternative, we propose to work with algorithmically constructed classification systems. We construct these classification systems by performing a large-scale clustering of publications based on their citation relations. In our analysis, 12 classification systems are constructed, each at a different granularity level. The number of fields in these systems ranges from 390 to 73,205 in granularity levels 1-12. This contrasts with the 236 subject categories in the WoS classification system. Based on an investigation of some key characteristics of the 12 classification systems, we argue that working with a few thousand fields may be an optimal choice. We then study the effect of the choice of a classification system on the citation impact of the 500 universities included in the 2013 edition of the CWTS Leiden Ranking. We consider both the MNCS and the PPtop 10% indicator. Globally, for all the universities taken together citation impact indicators generally turn out to be relatively insensitive to the choice of a classification system. Nevertheless, for individual universities, we sometimes observe substantial differences between indicators normalized based on the journal subject categories and indicators normalized based on an appropriately chosen algorithmically constructed classification system.
